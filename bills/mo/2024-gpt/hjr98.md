summary: |
  The bill, known as HJR98, aims to amend the Missouri Constitution so that the state legislature can review and block transportation department spending plans. Specifically, it allows the legislature to veto any transportation project or budget plan, including the statewide transportation improvement program (STIP), with just a majority vote. This change would give the legislature more control over transportation-related spending decisions, affecting how transportation projects are approved and funded in Missouri.
