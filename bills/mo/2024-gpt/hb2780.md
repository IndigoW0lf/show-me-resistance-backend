summary: |
  This bill changes existing laws related to commercial transactions involving government entities in Missouri. It specifically prohibits any public entity from accepting payments made with central bank digital currency (CBDC) and restricts participation in tests involving CBDC. The goal is to ensure that government transactions remain outside the scope of digital currencies issued directly by central banks. This affects government agencies and public organizations that might consider using or testing new digital payment systems.
