summary_short: "Starting August 28, 2024, county boards of equalization in Missouri will be elected by voters instead of appointed."
summary: |
  This bill changes the way county boards of equalization are formed in Missouri. Currently, in some counties, members are appointed by local officials, but this bill requires all seats on these boards to be elected through public voting starting August 28, 2024. Existing members will keep their seats until their current terms end, and new elections will fill future vacancies. The change affects counties of various sizes and cities without charters, ensuring more public involvement and transparency in property tax decisions.
