summary: |
  This bill is a formal statement from Missouriâ€™s House of Representatives that encourages state agencies and lawmakers to oppose the testing, creation, or implementation of a central bank digital currency (CBDC). It also asks Congress to pass laws that prevent the federal government from establishing a CBDC. The bill explains concerns that a CBDC could weaken people's financial privacy, harm banks, limit access to credit, and disrupt the economy by changing how the Federal Reserve manages money. It mainly affects U.S. federal and state financial systems, as well as consumers concerned about privacy and the stability of the banking system.
