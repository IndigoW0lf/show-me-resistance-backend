summary_short: "This bill creates stricter laws and penalties for fleeing from police during a vehicle stop or detention in Missouri."

summary: |
This bill, called "Valentine's Law," makes it a serious crime to run away from law enforcement when they try to stop or detain a vehicle. If someone knows or should know they are being stopped by police and they speed away in a way that risks serious injury or death, causes injury, or results in death, they can be charged with a felony. The law applies even if the police officer's actions are unlawful, and it is assumed that someone is fleeing if they continue driving after seeing emergency lights or hearing sirens. The specific penalties depend on the severity: running in a way that risks injury is a Class D felony, causing injury is a Class B felony, and causing death is a Class A felony. This bill primarily affects drivers, law enforcement, and the criminal justice system in Missouri.
