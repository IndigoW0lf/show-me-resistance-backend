summary: |
  The bill changes how the state communicates with people who fail to file required campaign and financial disclosure reports. It allows the executive director to send notices by regular mail or other means, instead of just registered or certified mail. It also sets stricter deadlines and higher fines for late filings, with fees increasing if reports are late by more than 30 days. The law applies to candidates, campaign committees, and individuals required to file financial interest statements, impacting those involved in political campaigns and government transparency efforts.
