summary: |
  This bill gives metro school districts in Missouri the authority to impose a very small sales tax—up to 0.25%—to help pay for special educational programs. Before the tax can be implemented, the school district must put the question to voters during a general election, and voters must agree to it. If approved, the revenue from this tax will be collected by the Missouri Department of Revenue and placed into a dedicated trust fund specifically for funding special education services, ensuring the money is used only for that purpose. This measure aims to improve support for students with special needs by providing additional funding through a local sales tax that requires voter approval.
