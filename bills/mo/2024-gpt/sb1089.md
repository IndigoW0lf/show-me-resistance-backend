summary_short: "This law change clarifies how people can challenge illegal searches and seizures by police in Missouri courts."
summary: |
  This bill updates Missouri law to specify how individuals who believe their property was unlawfully seized by law enforcement can fight back in court. If someone is involved in a criminal case that relates to seized property, they can file a written motion to have that evidence excluded during their trial. The law outlines when and how these motions can be made, what grounds are valid for challenging a seizure—such as lack of a warrant or violation of rights—and how the court will decide whether the evidence should be suppressed. The goal is to strengthen protections against illegal searches and seizures for individuals involved in legal proceedings.
