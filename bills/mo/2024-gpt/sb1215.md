summary: |
  The bill updates Missouri law to give licensed dentists the authority to prescribe and administer vaccines, such as flu shots, during dental care. This means that dentists can now provide vaccinations directly to patients, improving access and convenience. The change aims to enhance public health efforts by allowing dental professionals to play a role in vaccination efforts, potentially reaching more people who visit dental clinics.
