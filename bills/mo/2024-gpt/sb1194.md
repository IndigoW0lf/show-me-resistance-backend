summary_short: "Missouri law will automatically close certain criminal records after specific periods, making them inaccessible to the public, without needing a petition, starting August 28, 2026."

summary: |
  This bill in Missouri creates new rules for closing and hiding criminal records, called expungements. Starting August 28, 2026, many records from municipal, associate, or circuit courts will be automatically closed after certain time periods, depending on the type of offense. For example, records for certain non-violent offenses like traffic violations can be closed after one to five years if the person has kept a clean record, with longer times for more serious crimes. People who have received a full pardon from the governor will also have their records closed. The bill applies to many types of cases but does not automatically close juvenile records or records related to motor vehicle offenses. This helps individuals with past convictions have better access to employment and opportunities once their records are closed, provided they meet the eligibility criteria.
