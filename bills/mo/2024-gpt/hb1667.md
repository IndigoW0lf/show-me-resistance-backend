summary_short: "This bill lets residents petition to reduce their local property tax rates through a voting process, with certain limits and processes in place."
summary: |
  The bill allows residents living in a local area to submit a petition asking to lower their property taxes. If enough signatures are gathered, the question will go to a vote, but reductions are limited to 5% of the current tax rate and can only be proposed once every four years. The bill also excludes any part of the tax rate used for paying off bonds or debt. It affects property owners in local political subdivisions who want a say in how much they pay in property taxes and provides a clear process for how to request and vote on these reductions.
