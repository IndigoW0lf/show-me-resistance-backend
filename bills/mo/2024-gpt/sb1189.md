summary: |
  This bill changes the rules for prosecuting attorneys in Missouri. Starting January 1, 2025, all prosecuting attorneys will be considered state employees. This means they will gain access to state benefits like health care and retirement plans. The bill also sets new additional payments for prosecutors based on the inmate population in their counties. These changes will affect prosecutors across the state, except for circuit attorneys, who will have different rules. The goal is to improve benefits for prosecutors and clarify their employment status.
