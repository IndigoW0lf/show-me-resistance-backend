summary: |
  The Missouri Parent Empowerment Act allows eligible parents and guardians to receive a tax credit for educational costs they pay for their children. These costs include tuition, textbooks, tutoring, exam fees, summer programs, and educational services, among others. The credit aims to make education more affordable for families who choose private, parochial, or home schools instead of public schools. It applies to residents who are the child's legal parent or guardian and whose children are enrolled full-time in a qualified school or homeschooling. This measure is designed to give parents more options and financial support to choose the best education for their children.
