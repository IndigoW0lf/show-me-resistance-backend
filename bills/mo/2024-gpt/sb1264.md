summary: |
  This bill changes the rules about local use taxes in Missouri. It allows counties and municipalities (cities or towns) to add a local use tax if they first get approval from voters in an election. The local use tax would be set at the same rate as the local sales tax. The law explains how and when such taxes can be approved, including the voting process and timing. It aims to give local governments more authority to collect taxes for funding public services, but only with the input of local residents.
