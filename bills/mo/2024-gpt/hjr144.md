summary_short: "Proposes a constitutional change to better protect gun rights in Missouri and update firearm laws."
summary: |
  This bill aims to amend the Missouri Constitution to strengthen the right of citizens to keep and carry firearms, including ammunition and related accessories. It removes the current constitutional clause and replaces it with new wording that emphasizes unalienable gun rights and limits restrictions, allowing some laws targeting violent offenders or individuals with mental health issues. The bill also allows cities and counties like St. Louis and Kansas City to create their own gun regulations through ordinances, including permit systems and penalties, while ensuring these local laws recognize permits from other areas and exempt certain professionals like law enforcement and judges. This change could impact gun owners, law enforcement, local governments, and those involved in criminal justice or mental health services.
