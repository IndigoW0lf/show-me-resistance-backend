summary: |
  The bill changes existing laws to explicitly allow school security officers, along with police, park rangers, and conservation agents, to pursue and arrest individuals who commit crimes, including felonies and other offenses, even outside their usual jurisdiction. It clarifies what "fresh pursuit" means, including chasing someone suspected of committing a felony or a crime in the officerâ€™s presence, and expands the powers of various authorized personnel. The law also sets rules for arrest procedures when pursuing suspects without warrants and emphasizes safety policies for vehicle pursuits by law enforcement agencies. Overall, it enhances the authority and responsibilities of security officers and law enforcement in maintaining safety and responding quickly to crimes.
