summary_short: "This bill requires the Missouri Department of Transportation to prioritize federal high-priority corridors in transportation planning and to get approval from a joint committee for any changes to the transportation improvement plan."
summary: |
  The bill makes it clear that when Missouriâ€™s Department of Transportation plans its statewide transportation improvement program (STIP), it must focus on federal priority corridors identified in a federal law from 1991. Additionally, any proposed changes to the plan during implementation must be approved by a specific joint committee on administrative rules. This means the department has to consider these high-priority corridors and follow a formal approval process for updates, increasing oversight and transparency in transportation planning.
