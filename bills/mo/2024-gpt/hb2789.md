summary: |
  This bill changes the current laws regarding the custody of in vitro human embryos, which are human embryos created outside a woman's body. It clarifies how custody is defined and who can have legal or physical custody of these embryos, including options for joint custody, sole custody, or third-party custody. The law emphasizes making custody decisions based on what is best for the future child and considers factors like the wishes of the parents, the child's needs, and the parents' ability to care for the child. These updates may impact families, fertility clinics, and legal systems involved in reproductive choices and embryo custody disputes.
