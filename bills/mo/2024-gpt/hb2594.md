summary: |
  The Biometric Information Privacy Act sets strict guidelines on how private companies can collect, store, and use biometric information such as fingerprints, voiceprints, or facial scans. It defines what counts as biometric data and who is affected, mainly private businesses rather than government agencies. The law requires these companies to get clear, written permission from individuals before collecting their biometric data, especially if itâ€™s used for access to secure locations or devices. It aims to protect personal, sensitive information from misuse or unauthorized access, giving individuals more control over their biometric privacy.
