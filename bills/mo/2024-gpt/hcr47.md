summary: |
  This bill is a formal request from Missouri's House and Senate members asking Congress to pass laws that prohibit sanctuary cities and states. Sanctuary jurisdictions are areas that limit cooperation with federal immigration enforcement. The resolution also urges that these places be punished by losing federal funding if they do not comply with immigration laws. It aims to promote adherence to the rule of law and improve public safety by discouraging sanctuary policies.
