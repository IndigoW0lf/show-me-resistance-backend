summary: |
  The bill updates existing laws to include provisions that enable child care facilities to have epinephrine auto-injectors on hand. It allows authorized entities, such as child care providers, to acquire, store, and administer these devices to children experiencing severe allergic reactions (anaphylaxis). The law sets requirements for staff training, proper storage, and emergency response procedures to ensure quick and safe treatment if a child shows signs of a serious allergy. It aims to protect children with allergies by making emergency medication more accessible in child care settings, while excluding public schools from these provisions.
