summary_short: "This bill proposes a constitutional amendment in Missouri to reaffirm and clarify residents' rights to keep and bear arms, with specific regulations for cities and counties."
summary: |
  The bill aims to add a new section to Missouriâ€™s Constitution that solidifies the right of all citizens to possess and carry firearms, including ammunition and accessories, for personal defense and law enforcement assistance. It states that these rights are unalienable and requires any restrictions to undergo strict scrutiny, meaning they will be carefully examined to ensure they do not infringe on constitutional rights. The bill also allows cities like Kansas City and St. Louis to create their own rules about firearms, including issuing permits and setting fees, with certain exceptions for law enforcement, judges, security personnel, and military members. These regulations are designed to balance individual rights with public safety and give local governments some authority to govern firearm use within their limits.
