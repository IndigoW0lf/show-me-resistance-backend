summary_short: "This bill protects immigrant tenants from discrimination and harassment by landlords in Missouri."
summary: |
  The bill updates Missouri law to clearly define protections for immigrant tenants. It prohibits landlords from threatening to disclose or actually sharing a tenant's immigration or citizenship status to harass, intimidate, or retaliate against them. Landlords are also not allowed to try to take away a tenant's housing solely because of their immigration status. These rules aim to prevent unfair treatment based on immigration and help ensure all tenants are treated fairly regardless of their background. The bill affects landlords, tenants, and housing authorities by strengthening protections and clarifying legal boundaries related to immigration information.
