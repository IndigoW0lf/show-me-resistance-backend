summary_short: "This bill creates new family and medical leave protections for workers in Missouri."
summary: |
  The Missouri Family and Medical Leave Act establishes rules allowing eligible employees to take leave for caring for a new child, supporting a family member with a serious health issue, or addressing their own health problems. It also includes time off for activities related to a child's education or emergencies. The law applies to employers with at least 12 employees and defines key terms, such as what counts as a serious health condition and who is considered a family member. This helps workers balance their jobs and family responsibilities without losing their employment or income.
