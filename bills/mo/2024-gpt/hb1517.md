summary_short: "This bill updates rules for how property tax measures are presented on ballots and how tax changes are described to voters in Missouri."

summary: |
  The bill makes changes to how tax-related measures are listed and explained on election ballots. It requires ballot measures about taxes to be labeled with a number or letter in the order they are submitted, avoiding descriptive titles. Additionally, if a measure seeks to change property taxes, the ballot must clearly show how much the change would cost the average property owner in dollars. These rules aim to make voting on taxes clearer for residents and improve transparency in how tax proposals are communicated to the public.
