summary: |
  This bill changes Missouri laws regarding city earnings taxes. It requires cities that levy such taxes to file quarterly reports showing total tax receipts, broken down by residents' zip codes, refunds paid, and taxes related to remote work. These reports must be publicly accessible on city websites and shared with state officials. Additionally, starting in 2025, work done remotely outside the city cannot be taxed unless the work location is within the city, and taxpayers can seek refunds if they are taxed for remote work done elsewhere. This bill aims to make the earnings tax process more transparent and fair for taxpayers involved in remote work.
