summary_short: "This bill updates how county planning boards notify the public about hearings to create a master plan for physical development."
summary: |
  The bill changes the rules for how county planning boards announce public hearings related to their master plans. Instead of just posting notices in public places, it now requires that notice of these hearings also be posted on the county's official website at least fifteen days in advance. The bill aims to improve transparency by making information more accessible online, allowing residents to stay informed about plans for land use, transportation, parks, and other community development projects. This affects county governments, residents, and anyone interested in local planning and development.
