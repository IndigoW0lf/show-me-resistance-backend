summary: |
  This bill repeals and replaces existing laws on family trust companies in Missouri, known as the Missouri Family Trust Company Act. It defines new key terms related to how these companies operate, including who can be involved and how they interact with family members and the public. The goal is to strengthen regulations around how family trust companies are formed, managed, and how they do business, especially with the general public. This affects family members who are involved with these companies, as well as anyone who might seek trust or business services from them, ensuring clearer rules and better oversight.
