summary: |
  This bill updates Missouri laws to clarify when and how information about a person's HIV infection or test results can be shared. It states that HIV information must stay private and only be disclosed to certain people or organizations, such as healthcare providers, law enforcement, or legal officials, when necessary for public health or legal cases. The bill also specifies that victims of sexual offenses or individuals who test positive can access their own test results. Overall, it aims to protect individuals' privacy but allows limited sharing with authorized parties for public safety and legal reasons.
