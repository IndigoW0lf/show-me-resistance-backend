summary: |
  This bill changes the way cities and villages select banks to hold their public money. It requires municipalities to choose their banking partners through a fair, competitive process by requesting proposals. The process includes checking the financial health of banks, considering the services they offer, and ensuring they meet legal regulations. Once a bank is chosen, the municipality will sign a contract that details the terms, like interest rates and fees. This update aims to improve transparency, protect public funds, and make sure municipalities get good banking services.
