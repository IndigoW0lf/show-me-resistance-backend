summary_short: "This bill allows certain court records of deceased persons convicted of misdemeanors to be made confidential upon request."

summary: |
  The bill permits parents, spouses, children, or personal representatives of someone who was convicted of a misdemeanor and has been deceased for at least six months to ask the court to keep that person's court record confidential. When a request is made, the court will review whether making the record confidential might unfairly affect anyone involved. If approved, the court will remove the record from automated case management systems, helping to protect the privacy of the deceased and their families.
