summary_short: "This resolution proposes a change to Missouri's constitution to update how motor fuel taxes are collected and used for road funding, starting with a vote in November 2024."

summary: |
  The bill suggests amending Missouri's constitution to clarify and modify the rules about fuel taxes used for highways. It would require a vote by Missouri voters in the 2024 election to approve this change. If approved, the new rules will direct how fuel tax money is collected, refunded if not used for highway vehicles, and then distributed to counties, cities, and the state highway department. The funds collected will mainly be used for building and maintaining roads, bridges, and highways across the state, with specific portions allocated to local counties for local road projects.
