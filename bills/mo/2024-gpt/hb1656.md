summary_short: "This bill updates Missouri law to specify which property can be claimed as exempt during bankruptcy proceedings."
summary: |
  The bill changes the rules about what property someone can keep when filing for bankruptcy in Missouri. It allows individuals to exempt, or protect, property from being taken or sold to pay debts, as long as that property is already protected under Missouri or federal law. However, it does not include certain types of property listed under federal bankruptcy rules. This change mainly affects people going through bankruptcy by clarifying what property they can keep without losing it to creditors.
