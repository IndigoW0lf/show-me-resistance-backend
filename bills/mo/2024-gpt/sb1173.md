summary: |
  The bill makes it so that members of Missouri's General Assembly must disclose to the Missouri Ethics Commission if they introduce legislation that benefits their employer, whether they sponsor or co-sponsor the bill. They have to file this report within 15 days of introducing the bill. The Ethics Commission will create a system for submitting these reports and can set rules to manage this process. The goal is to increase transparency and prevent conflicts of interest among legislators.
