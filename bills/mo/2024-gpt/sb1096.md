summary_short: "This bill updates Missouri laws to better define and regulate alternative dispute resolution methods like mediation and arbitration."
summary: |
  This legislation repeals an old section of state law and replaces it with new provisions that clarify how alternative dispute resolution (ADR) processes such as mediation, arbitration, and early neutral evaluation are defined and conducted. It sets clear rules about what communication during ADR is protected, what constitutes conflicts of interest, and who can participate as neutral mediators or arbitrators. The bill applies to civil legal cases and aims to make dispute resolution more transparent, fair, and consistent across the state. It impacts courts, legal professionals, and individuals involved in civil disputes seeking alternative ways to resolve issues without going to trial.
