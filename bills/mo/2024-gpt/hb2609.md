summary_short: "State employees working ten-hour days and forty hours a week won't have to use two hours of vacation for paid holidays."

summary: |
  This bill changes the rules for certain state employees in Missouri. If an employee works ten hours a day and a total of 40 hours a week, they will no longer be required to use two hours of their annual leave (vacation time) on paid holidays. Instead, these employees can choose to be paid only for an eight-hour workday during holidays, which gives them more flexibility and time off without losing vacation hours. This change mainly affects higher-hour workweek employees and helps them better manage their time off during holidays.
