summary_short: "This bill proposes changes to Missouri's election laws, including voting eligibility, voting methods, primary election procedures, and regulations for voting machines, to improve election processes and transparency."
summary: |
  This bill, called SJR78, aims to update Missouri's constitution regarding elections. It removes the old rules found in Sections 2 and 3 of Article VIII and replaces them with new provisions. These changes include clarifying who is eligible to vote, like U.S. citizens over 18 who reside in the state, and excluding those with certain mental or legal restrictions. It also specifies that voting must be done by paper or approved mechanical methods, with one vote per issue or office. For primaries, the candidate with the most votes automatically advances to the general election. Additionally, the bill requires voting machines to be tested and certified for security before use. These updates are meant to ensure fair voting procedures and increased transparency for all eligible voters in Missouri.
