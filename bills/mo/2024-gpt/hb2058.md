summary_short: "This bill changes rules about local taxes and special districts, including when proposals can be resubmitted after being rejected."
summary: |
  This bill makes it so that if a local government proposes a new tax or wants to increase an existing tax and voters say no, they can't try again during the same election cycle. However, if a new proposal has a significant change—like lowering the tax rate by at least 25% or adding a new dedicated fund—they can resubmit it sooner. The bill also updates rules about how local districts are created, including the required public petitions and the information needed for approval, such as proposed plans, costs, and funding sources.
