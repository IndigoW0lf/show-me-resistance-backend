summary: |
  This bill changes the rules for financial assistance programs for college students in Missouri. It sets new maximum and minimum award amounts depending on whether students attend public, private, or virtual colleges, and these amounts are adjusted over several years. The bill also ensures that students with lower family income are guaranteed at least the minimum award, while those with higher income may receive smaller awards. Additionally, if there is not enough funding, the amounts will be scaled back evenly, and extra funds may be used to help more students. The goal is to make college financial aid more clear, fair, and responsive to funding levels and student needs.
