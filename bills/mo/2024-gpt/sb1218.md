summary_short: "This law makes it easier for older, non-murder offenders to get parole after serving 30 years in prison."
summary: |
  This bill changes the rules for parole eligibility in Missouri. It states that prisoners who are 65 or older, have no first-degree murder convictions, and have served at least 30 years can have a parole hearing. During the hearing, the parole board will decide if thereâ€™s a good chance the person can live peacefully outside prison. If approved, these offenders will be released with supervision for at least five years. If they are not granted parole, they can ask for a new hearing every two years. The rule aims to provide second chances for older, reformed inmates while still allowing for legal oversight and other forms of clemency.
