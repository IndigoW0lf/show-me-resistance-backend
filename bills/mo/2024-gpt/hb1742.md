summary: |
  This bill updates regulations for athletic associations statewide, focusing on employees and volunteers who work with students. It requires schools and charter schools to have policies about sharing information on former workers and volunteers, especially regarding any misconduct, including sexual abuse. School districts must conduct background checks and can only return someone to volunteer or work if a court reverses a finding of abuse. The law aims to promote student safety by making sure that schools share important information and monitor individuals with a history of misconduct.
