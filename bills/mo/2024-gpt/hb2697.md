summary_short: "This bill makes juvenile court records more confidential, limiting who can see them and under what circumstances."
summary: |
  The bill changes the rules about who can access juvenile court records in Missouri. It generally keeps these records private, allowing only certain people, like judges, to see them unless the case involves very serious crimes (like murder or felony-level offenses). After a juvenile is found delinquent for serious offenses, some court records may be made public, but most will remain confidential to protect the privacy of minors. This affects juveniles involved in the court system, their families, law enforcement, and court officials by clarifying when and how records can be seen or shared.
