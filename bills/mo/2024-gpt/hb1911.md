summary: |
  The Missouri Parental Choice Tax Credit Act allows eligible parents and guardians to receive a tax credit for certain educational costs they pay for their children. This includes expenses such as tuition, books, tutoring, testing fees, educational therapies, and technology used for learning at approved private, parochial, or home schools. The goal is to give parents more financial support when choosing alternative education options outside public schools. It affects parents or guardians of students enrolled full-time in qualified schools, helping to reduce their tax burden for qualifying educational expenses.
