summary: |
  This bill makes it so that all firearm transfers in Missouri must go through a background check. If you're not a licensed dealer, you need to arrange for a licensed dealer or law enforcement to check if you're cleared to receive the firearm. Licensed dealers and law enforcement agencies will be responsible for performing these checks, keeping records, and providing the results to the parties involved. The law aims to improve gun safety by giving law enforcement access to background checks for all firearm transfers, but it does not apply to transfers of antique guns, or family gifts and loans between immediate family members.
