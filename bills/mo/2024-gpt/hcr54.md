summary: |
  This bill encourages residents of both St. Louis City and St. Louis County to petition their local leaders to establish a constitutional board. This board, created under Missouriâ€™s Constitution, would gather public input and consider options for restructuring the government. The goal is to improve efficiency and cooperation between the city and county by possibly changing their current separate governments. Any recommendations made by the board would need approval from voters in both areas. The resolution aims to promote discussion and potentially lead to a government overhaul that better serves residents.
