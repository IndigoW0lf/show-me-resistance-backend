summary_short: "This bill creates procedures for court-ordered temporary firearm restrictions and seizure to prevent gun violence, especially involving individuals at risk."
summary: |
  This bill allows people to petition courts to issue extreme risk protection orders (ERPOs) for individuals who may pose a danger to themselves or others by owning or controlling guns. If the court finds enough evidence, it can issue an order that prevents the person from buying, owning, or possessing firearms for up to one year. It also authorizes law enforcement to seize any firearms the person currently has. The aim is to help prevent gun-related harm in situations where someone is considered a risk, such as after recent violence, threats, or substance abuse. The bill impacts gun owners, individuals involved in domestic situations, law enforcement, and the courts.
