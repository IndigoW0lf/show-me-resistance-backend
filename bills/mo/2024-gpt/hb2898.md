summary: |
  This bill updates Missouri's laws about shipping wine directly to consumers. It lets wineries that are properly licensed to send up to four cases of wine each month to adults in Missouri for their personal use. The law sets rules for licensing, labeling, reporting, and paying taxes, and it clarifies how shipments must be handled. This change affects both in-state and out-of-state wineries and carriers, making it easier for them to deliver wine directly to Missouri residents under specific regulations.
