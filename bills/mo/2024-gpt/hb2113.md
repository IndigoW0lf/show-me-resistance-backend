summary_short: "This bill requires written parental consent for certain changes to a child's special education plan (IEP)."
summary: |
  This bill makes it so that parents must give written permission before a child's special education plan (called an IEP) can be changed, such as moving the child to a different placement, adding or removing services, or changing the amount of time spent on services. It applies to public schools and other educational agencies that serve students with disabilities. The law aims to ensure parents are fully informed and agree to any significant changes to their child's education plan, giving them more control and involvement in decision-making. Schools will also have to use a standard form in the parent's native language to document consent.
