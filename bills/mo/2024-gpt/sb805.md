summary_short: "This bill updates rules for building electric transmission lines and other utility projects in Missouri."  
summary: |
  This bill changes the laws in Missouri about how utility companies, like electricity and water providers, can build new infrastructure. It requires these companies to get approval from the state's utility commission before starting construction on certain projects, especially large electric transmission facilities approved by regional operators. The goal is to ensure that new electric transmission lines are designed to fit existing infrastructure when possible, are placed in ways that minimize impact, and that the process includes public and regulatory review. This bill mainly affects utility companies and aims to improve oversight and planning for infrastructure projects that serve the publicâ€™s energy needs.
