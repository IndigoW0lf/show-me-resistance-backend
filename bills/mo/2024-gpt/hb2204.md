summary: |
  This bill gives the Missouri parole board the authority to grant parole with lifetime supervision to people who were under 20 years old when they committed their crime and who have served at least 30 years in prison. To qualify, these individuals must not have been previously convicted of a dangerous felony, and their victims or families can comment on their release. The process includes a careful review of their rehabilitation efforts, criminal history, and community support. Once released on lifetime supervision, the person will be monitored electronically for their entire life, with regular check-ins and supervision reviews to ensure public safety and support their reintegration.
