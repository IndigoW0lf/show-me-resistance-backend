summary_short: "This bill allows employers to deduct the wages they pay to employees serving jury duty from their Missouri state income taxes."

summary: |
  Starting in 2025, Missouri employers can claim a tax deduction for up to 100% of the wages they pay to employees while those employees are serving on a jury. This includes regular wages, as well as any jury duty compensations or allowances. The purpose of this bill is to encourage employers to support employees who are fulfilling their civic duty without financial loss. It affects businesses that have employees called for jury duty, providing them with a potential tax benefit. The Missouri Department of Revenue will create rules to help implement this new deduction, which will be in place for six years unless the law is renewed or changed by the state legislature.
