summary_short: "This bill lets law enforcement arrest certain parolees or probationers without a warrant in specific situations and requires their conditions to be recorded in the statewide system."

summary: |
  This legislation makes it easier for law enforcement officers to arrest offenders on parole or probation without needing a warrant, under specific circumstances. It also requires that the conditions and terms of an offenderâ€™s parole or probation be quickly shared with the Missouri state highway patrol and entered into the statewide law enforcement system (MULES). Additionally, the bill sets rules for offenders to register their new residence when they change locations and penalizes failure to do so. These changes aim to improve supervision and public safety for individuals on parole or probation, as well as help law enforcement keep track of them more effectively.
