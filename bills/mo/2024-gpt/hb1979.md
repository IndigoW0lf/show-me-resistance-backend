summary_short: "This bill updates Missouri laws about blood tests for pregnant women, requiring testing for certain diseases with their consent."
summary: |
  The bill changes existing laws to specify that pregnant women in Missouri can be tested for diseases like syphilis, hepatitis B, hepatitis C, and HIV during early pregnancy, with their permission. Healthcare providers such as doctors, midwives, and nurses must take blood samples at the first prenatal visit or within 20 days, and again at 28 weeks of pregnancy. If a woman tests positive for any of these diseases, proper treatment must be provided according to current medical guidelines. The law also ensures that testing is available regardless of whether the woman can pay and sets standards for how the tests are conducted to ensure they are approved and reliable.
