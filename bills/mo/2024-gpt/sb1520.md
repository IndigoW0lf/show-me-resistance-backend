  The bill, SB1520, creates new rules regarding illegal entry into Missouri. It states that people who enter the state in violation of federal immigration laws can face a $10,000 fine and may be ordered to leave the state. If they try to re-enter illegally after being caught once, they can face criminal charges that could lead to a felony conviction and mandatory deportation.

The law also specifies how the deportation process should be carried out, including transportation details and responsible agencies. This bill mainly affects undocumented immigrants and law enforcement agencies working to enforce immigration laws in Missouri.
