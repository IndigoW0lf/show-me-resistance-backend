summary_short: "This bill updates rules for developing long-term care facilities, including requiring a certificate of need before starting new health services."
summary: |
  The bill changes some laws about long-term care facilities in Missouri. It requires anyone wanting to build or offer new healthcare services, like a nursing home or similar facility, to get a special approval called a certificate of need first. This approval is given only if the service is deemed necessary, helping to control the number and type of facilities. The bill also sets rules about licensing, project costs, reporting, and penalties for starting new facilities without proper approval, affecting developers, healthcare providers, and state agencies involved in health facility planning and oversight.
