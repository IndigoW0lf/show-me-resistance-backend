summary_short: "This bill sets rules for residents to run small, no-impact home-based businesses with municipal approval and neighborhood notice requirements."

summary: |
  The bill allows property owners and leaseholders in Missouri to operate small home businesses that do not disturb their neighborhood, as long as they follow certain rules. To do so, they must submit an affidavit to the local government explaining their business and confirming it will not cause noise, traffic, or other disruptions. The city will review the affidavit to make sure the business meets standards, and if approved, the owner must inform nearby neighbors about the business. The bill also requires periodic checks to ensure ongoing compliance and sets penalties for operating without approval or violating the rules. This legislation is designed to make it easier for people to start home-based businesses while preserving neighborhood quality.
