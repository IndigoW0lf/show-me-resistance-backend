summary_short: "This bill proposes amending Missouri's Constitution to require Jackson County to have an elected assessor instead of an appointed assessment department."
summary: |
  The bill, known as HJR73, suggests a change to the Missouri Constitution that would make the county assessor in Jackson County an elected position. Currently, Jackson County has an assessment department that is not elected by voters. If approved, this change means residents of Jackson County would choose their assessor through elections, increasing transparency and accountability for property assessments and related duties. The proposal will be voted on by the public during the next statewide election or a special election in 2024.
