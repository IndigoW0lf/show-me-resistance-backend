summary_short: "This law stops certain taxpayers from receiving tax credits if they pay for their employees to have abortions."
summary: |
  This bill, called SB1320, prevents any person or business from claiming a tax credit if they pay for an employee's abortion. It specifically states that paying for health insurance premiums linked to an employee's abortion does not count as a payment for this purpose. The law allows government agencies to create rules to enforce this rule, but those rules must follow specific legal procedures. Essentially, it means that companies or individuals cannot get tax benefits if they help cover the cost of an employee's abortion, with some legal limits on how the rules are made and enforced.
