summary_short: "This bill updates how Missouri manages funds to pay legal costs the state might owe after court decisions."
summary: |
  The bill revises laws related to the Judicial Finance Commission by creating a new "State Legal Expense Fund." This fund collects money from state budgets and other sources to pay for legal claims against the state, its agencies, and certain state employees when they are found liable in court. It also applies to healthcare providers employed or contracted by the state, including doctors, nurses, and pharmacists, who work part-time or under formal agreements. The changes clarify who can access the fund and the situations it covers, helping ensure that legal expenses are properly managed and paid when needed. This primarily affects state agencies, employees, and healthcare providers working with the state.
