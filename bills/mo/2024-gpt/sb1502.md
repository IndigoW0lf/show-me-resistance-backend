summary_short: "Counties and cities in Missouri will be reimbursed for housing inmates from other areas, under specific population criteria."
summary: |
  This bill requires that if a county or city in Missouri pays to house an inmate or detainee who is a resident of another town or county, the resident's home area must repay the housing costs. The rule applies only to certain counties and independent cities based on their population size. The legislation aims to ensure that local governments are fairly reimbursed when they house out-of-area inmates, helping to share the costs more evenly across different regions.
