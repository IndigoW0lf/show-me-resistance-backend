summary: |
  HB1538 makes it illegal for utility companies to disconnect gas or electric service for residential customers who rely on these utilities for heating when the weather is very cold. Specifically, service cannot be turned off on days when the forecast predicts temperatures will drop below 32Â°F, or if utility workers are unavailable during those low temperatures. The bill also provides protections for low-income disabled customers from November 1 to March 31, as long as they are enrolled in a special payment plan and have been making payments. This law aims to protect residents from losing heat or power during the winter's coldest days, especially those who are most vulnerable.
