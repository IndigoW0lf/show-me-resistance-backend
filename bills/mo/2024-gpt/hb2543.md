summary: |
  This bill updates the laws in Missouri regarding property tax credits for senior homeowners. It allows counties to offer a special property tax credit to seniors aged 62 and older who own and live in their primary home. If approved, this credit helps reduce the amount of property tax seniors have to pay when their taxes go up. Counties can choose to adopt this credit through an ordinance or by holding a public vote. The goal is to help older residents stay in their homes by easing the financial burden of rising property taxes.
