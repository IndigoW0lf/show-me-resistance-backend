  This bill makes changes to the laws about contracts for public building and construction projects in Missouri. It requires public entities to demand a payment bond from contractors when the project's cost exceeds fifty thousand dollars. The bond assures that suppliers, workers, and others will be paid for their materials and labor. The bill clarifies who is considered a contractor and who is affected, including public agencies, contractors, and subcontractors, and aims to improve financial security and accountability on public works projects.
