summary_short: "Property-owning LLCs in St. Louis County must name a contact person with the county clerk."
summary: |
  This bill requires limited liability companies (LLCs) that own, rent, or have unoccupied real estate in certain parts of St. Louis County and nearby cities to file a document with the county or city clerk. This document must include the name and address of one natural person who manages or controls the property. If the person in charge changes, the LLC must update the filing within 30 days. The goal is to improve transparency by knowing who is responsible for property owned by LLCs in these areas.
