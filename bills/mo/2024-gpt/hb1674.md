summary: |
  The "Employee Restroom and Locker Room Access Act" is a new Missouri law that aims to protect employeesâ€™ privacy by ensuring they can use restrooms and locker rooms that match their biological sex. The law bans employers from requiring employees to share these facilities with someone of the opposite sex, which they say can create uncomfortable or hostile work environments. It applies to all workplaces in Missouri, whether public or private, and covers facilities like restrooms, locker rooms, and changing areas. The law is designed to support a respectful and safe workplace environment for all employees based on their biological sex.
