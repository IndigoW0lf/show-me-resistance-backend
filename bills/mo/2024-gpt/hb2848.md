  Starting July 1, 2025, public colleges and universities in Missouri must offer designated lactation rooms on campus at no cost. These rooms are for women who need private space to breastfeed or express milk, and must include features like a lockable door, a sink, a refrigerator for storing breast milk, and electrical outlets. The bill applies to institutions that receive state funding and meet certain standards. It aims to support breastfeeding students, teachers, and staff, making it easier for them to take care of their health while working or studying.
