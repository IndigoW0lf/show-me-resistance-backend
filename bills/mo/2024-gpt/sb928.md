summary: |
  This bill updates Missouri laws to support the development of clean energy sources, specifically small nuclear power plants and other renewable energy facilities. It allows electric utilities to include certain construction costs of these new plants in their rate calculations before the plants are fully operational. This means utilities can recover some costs earlier, helping to fund the construction of cleaner, more sustainable power sources. The bill also clarifies rules around rate charges and sets standards for new nuclear plants rated at 400 megawatts or less, aiming to promote cleaner energy infrastructure while ensuring utilities and consumers are protected.
