summary: |
  This bill, known as HB2168, provides a tax exemption starting January 1, 2025, for equipment used by companies that provide broadband internet services. This means that broadband providers can buy things like wires, cables, servers, antennas, and other technology needed to offer internet access without paying sales taxes on these items. The goal is to help make building and maintaining internet networks more affordable for providers, which could lead to better and faster internet access for residents and businesses. To qualify, providers need to show a certificate that confirms their equipment is for broadband service, and they can also choose to pay their taxes directly to the state instead of including them in their purchase price. This legislation affects broadband companies, equipment vendors, and aims to improve internet infrastructure across Missouri.
