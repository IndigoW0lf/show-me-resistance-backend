summary: |
  The bill grants the city of Joplin the authority to impose a sales tax to support public safety initiatives, such as police and fire services. Before implementing this tax, the city must get approval from local voters. If approved, the tax would be up to half a percent on certain retail sales within the city. This means residents and visitors who buy goods in Joplin could help generate funds specifically for making the community safer.
