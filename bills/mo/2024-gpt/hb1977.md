summary: |
  This bill sets rules to prevent discrimination against certain healthcare providers and pharmacies that buy drugs at discounted 340B prices. It requires health insurers and pharmacy benefits managers to treat these providers fairly, including how they get reimbursed for drugs and the terms they use. The law aims to stop practices that could limit access to affordable medications or unfairly shift benefits away from eligible patients and providers. It primarily affects federally qualified health centers, pharmacies involved in the 340B program, health insurers, and pharmacy benefit managers.
