summary: |
  This bill changes the rules about legal documents filed in court cases. It states that all filings by represented parties must include the attorney's name and contact information, while unrepresented parties must sign their own pleadings with their personal details. The bill also simplifies certain requirements for verifying these documents, allowing statements made under penalty of perjury or affirmations instead of sworn affidavits or notarizations. These updates aim to make legal procedures clearer and more straightforward for everyone involved, including both attorneys and individuals representing themselves.
