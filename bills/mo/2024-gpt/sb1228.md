summary: |
  The Missouri legislature has passed a law that allows taxpayers to receive a $2,500 tax credit when they buy a new electric vehicle, such as a battery electric or plug-in hybrid car. This credit can be claimed each year for up to three years after the purchase. It aims to encourage more people to buy electric cars by reducing the cost and promoting cleaner transportation. The law applies to residents who pay state income taxes and is set to be in effect for at least six years, but it may be reauthorized or end earlier under certain rules.
