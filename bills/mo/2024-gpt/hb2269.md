summary: |
  This bill changes the current tax laws so that specific sales of motor vehicles are not taxed. It applies to vehicles bought and sold within Missouri and between Missouri and other states or countries. The exemption helps reduce costs for people and businesses involved in purchasing and selling motor vehicles, making transportation and vehicle transactions more affordable. It ensures that sales of cars and other motor vehicles are not taxed when they are part of interstate or international trade, as long as such sales are already protected from taxation under federal or state law.
