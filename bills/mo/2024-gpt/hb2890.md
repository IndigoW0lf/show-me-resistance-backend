summary_short: "This bill requires dental plans in Missouri to report on how much of their premiums are spent on actual dental care for policyholders."

summary: |
  The bill mandates that dental insurance plans in Missouri must file an annual report called a dental loss ratio. This report shows the percentage of premiums that are used directly for patient care, such as dental treatments, rather than administrative costs like staffing or marketing. The goal is to increase transparency so consumers can see how much of their premiums go toward actual dental services. The Department of Commerce and Insurance will oversee these reports to ensure dental plans are transparent about their spending. This affects dental insurance companies operating in Missouri, encouraging them to be clearer about their costs and services.
