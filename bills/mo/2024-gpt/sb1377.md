summary_short: "This law bans government agencies and local governments in Missouri from using or buying automated license plate reader systems on public roads, with some exceptions."
summary: |
  This bill makes it illegal for government agencies and local governments in Missouri to purchase, install, or use automated license plate readers on public highways. These systems use cameras and computers to automatically recognize and record vehicle license plates and related data. The only exceptions are if the data is collected by police officers' vehicles or through third-party vendors according to existing laws. The goal is to protect privacy and limit government monitoring of vehicle movements on public roads.
