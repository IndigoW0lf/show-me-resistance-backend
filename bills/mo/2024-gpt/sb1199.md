  The bill makes changes to Missouri's voting laws by adjusting the age when people can register and vote.

The bill also clarifies that people who are considered incapacitated or are currently in prison cannot vote. Additionally, individuals convicted of certain felonies or crimes related to voting are either temporarily or permanently disqualified from voting or serving as jurors, depending on the specifics. These rules take effect starting January 1, 2025, and affect all eligible voters, including those with past felony convictions.
