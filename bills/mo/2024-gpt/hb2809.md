summary: |
  The bill improves the authority and access of the Missouri Office of Child Advocate. It allows the office to access detailed information about children in protective services, including their locations and reports of abuse or neglect. The office can privately communicate with children and those working with them, inspect records from courts and agencies, and work with juvenile officials. It can also file reports, make recommendations, and intervene in court cases to support children and families. Additionally, the bill authorizes the office to seek funding and manage regional panels to carry out its duties. These changes aim to strengthen oversight and protection for vulnerable children in Missouri.
