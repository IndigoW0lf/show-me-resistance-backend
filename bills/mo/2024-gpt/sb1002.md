summary: |
  The bill prohibits public school districts and charter schools from implementing rules that require students to wear face masks or other face coverings. It also focuses on immunizations for other diseases, making sure children attend school only if they have received required vaccines, unless parents object for religious or medical reasons. The legislation affects publicly funded and private schools in Missouri, ensuring they cannot mandate face masks related to COVID-19 but still must comply with other immunization requirements. It aims to balance public health policies with individual rights and parental choices.
