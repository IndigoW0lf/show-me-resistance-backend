summary: | 
  The bill, called HB2533, states that the Missouri state government and local subdivisions cannot pass laws, rules, or ordinances that require businesses to be open on Sundays. This means that businesses will have the freedom to choose whether or not to open on Sundays without being forced by the government. It affects businesses, local governments, and the state's ability to set regulations about operating hours on Sundays. The goal is to give businesses more flexibility in deciding their operating days.
