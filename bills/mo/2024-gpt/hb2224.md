summary: |
  This bill changes the way sales tax is applied to certain everyday items. Starting October 1, 2024, feminine hygiene products like tampons, pads, and cups, as well as diapers, will be taxed at a lower rate, similar to the tax rate on food. This means these essential items will become more affordable for consumers. The change primarily benefits people who use these products regularly, such as women and families with young children, by reducing their overall costs.
