summary_short: "Gun owners must report lost or stolen firearms within 72 hours to law enforcement; failing to report can result in fines or penalties."
summary: |
  This bill requires anyone who owns a firearm to notify local law enforcement within three days if their gun is lost or stolen. The law enforcement agency will then record details like the make, model, and serial number of the firearm in a statewide system. If someone does not report a lost or stolen firearm on time, they could face fines or even a misdemeanor charge, especially if they fail to report multiple times. The goal is to help prevent illegal gun use and improve tracking of firearms that are lost or stolen.
