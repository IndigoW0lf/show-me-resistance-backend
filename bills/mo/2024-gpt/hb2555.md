summary_short: "This law allows eligible criminal records in Missouri to be automatically closed or expunged after certain conditions are met, making them inaccessible to the public."
summary: |
  Starting in August 2027, Missouri will automatically close the criminal records of people for certain minor offenses, after they satisfy specific time periods and conditions. This includes infractions, misdemeanors, and some felonies, especially if the person has completed their sentence and stayed out of trouble. Older adults over 65 who haven't committed new crimes can also have their records closed. This process helps individuals with past offenses move forward without the stigma of their criminal records, making it easier to find jobs or housing.
