summary_short: "This law makes it illegal for minors under 19 to knowingly possess a handgun and sets penalties for doing so."

summary: |
  The bill creates a new law in Missouri that makes it a crime for minors under 19 (or under 18 if in the military) to knowingly have a handgun. If a minor is found in possession of a handgun, they can be fined up to $200, sentenced to up to 10 days in a juvenile detention facility, or both. This law is designed to discourage minors from possessing handguns and to provide penalties if they do so, helping to promote safety and reduce gun-related incidents involving young people.
