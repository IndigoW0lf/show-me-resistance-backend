summary: |
  This bill updates Missouri’s tax laws to promote better access to fresh food in underserved areas. It allows people and businesses to receive a tax credit equal to 50% of their expenses when they build or improve urban farms or small specialty crop farms located in food deserts—areas with high poverty and limited access to full-service grocery stores. Urban farms are small farms in cities that produce food for the community, while small-scale specialty crop farms are farms no larger than 30 acres that grow multiple types of fruits and vegetables or other horticultural crops. The bill also sets limits on the size of the tax credit, capping it at $5,000 per farm and $25,000 total per farm each year. Additionally, it creates a new tax credit for grocery stores that open or operate in food deserts to help bring fresh food options to those communities. Overall, the goal is to support local food production and improve healthy food access for residents in underserved areas.
