summary: |
  This bill Mandates that hospitals and nursing homes in Missouri form joint health and safety committees made up of equal numbers of employer and worker representatives. These committees will meet regularly to review safety programs, investigate incidents, conduct inspections, and recommend safety improvements. Employers must allow employee representatives to participate and be paid their usual wages during committee activities. If facilities don't comply, they could face fines of up to five thousand dollars per day. The goal is to ensure better collaboration on health and safety issues in healthcare workplaces, protecting workers and patients alike.
