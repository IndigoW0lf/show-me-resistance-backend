summary_short: "This bill allows people who were wrongfully convicted of a felony in Missouri to receive restitution for their time spent in prison after being proven actually innocent, with specific rules and limits."
summary: |
  This bill creates a process for individuals in Missouri who have been convicted of a serious crime but later proven to be actually innocent to receive financial compensation. If someone was wrongly convicted and later found to be innocent through evidence (not DNA analysis), they can petition the court for restitution. They will receive a payment of $100 for each day they were in prison after their conviction was overturned. The law also sets rules to determine when someone is considered actually innocent and how much money they can receive each year, with a cap of $36,500 annually. The law helps ensure that innocent people who were wrongly imprisoned get some financial support, but it also limits the total payout and clarifies that this does not affect other legal rights or claims they might have.
