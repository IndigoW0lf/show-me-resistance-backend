summary: |
  This bill, called SB1238, makes sure that health insurance plans in Missouri include coverage for maternity care given by midwives, such as certified nurse midwives and professional midwives. It states that people covered by these plans can get reimbursed for midwifery services just like they would for doctor-provided care, with no extra charges or discrimination. Additionally, the bill sets up a process for registering and approving doulas—support persons for pregnant women—and encourages insurance reimbursement for their support services. This affects pregnant women, their families, midwives, and doula service providers by increasing access to comprehensive maternity care.
