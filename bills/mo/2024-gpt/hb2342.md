summary_short: "This bill creates rules for community solar gardens, allowing people to subscribe to shared solar energy projects and receive credits on their electric bills."

summary: |
  This bill sets up a framework for community solar gardens in Missouri. It defines how these solar projects work, who can participate, and how subscribers benefit. People who live in the area and use electricity from retail suppliers can subscribe to these solar facilities, which generate clean energy remotely. Subscribers receive credits on their electric bills based on the solar energy their share produces, helping make solar energy more accessible and affordableâ€”especially for low-income households and community organizations. The rules also specify the size of the projects and the responsibilities of organizations managing these solar gardens.
