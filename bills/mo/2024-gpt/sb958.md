summary: |
  This bill makes changes to the rules for certain agricultural tax credits in Missouri. It allows wood energy producers to get a tax credit of $5 per ton for using Missouri forest residue, but these credits will only be available until June 30, 2030. It also introduces a new tax credit for meat processing facilities that modernize or expand their operations, including new buildings, equipment, and waste management systems, with a deadline of December 31, 2030. The bill sets a total cap of six million dollars per year on these tax credits and specifies that no new credits will be issued after June 30, 2030 unless funding is approved. These changes aim to support the growth of renewable energy and meat processing businesses in Missouri.
