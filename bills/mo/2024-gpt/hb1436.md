summary: |
  This bill changes the laws around how certain Missouri counties and cities can collect taxes to fund services for people with developmental disabilities, such as sheltered workshops and related facilities. It allows local governments with approval from voters to levy taxes, up to a set limit, to support these services. The funds collected must be used exclusively for the purpose of establishing and maintaining workshops, residences, and related services for individuals with developmental disabilities. The bill also specifies that these funds can only be spent when approved by the designated board and clarifies that additional certifications for organizations receiving funding should not be unnecessarily burdensome.
