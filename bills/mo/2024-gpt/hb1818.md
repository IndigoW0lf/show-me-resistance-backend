summary: |
  This bill changes the way the state government deals with purchasing supplies over $100,000. It allows the office of administration to hold negotiations with vendors after receiving proposals, to clarify terms and potentially get a better deal. Previously, the government mainly selected the lowest bid through competitive processes, but this bill gives them more flexibility to negotiate and improve contract conditions. It affects vendors who want to do business with the state and state officials responsible for purchasing, aiming to make procurement more efficient and tailored to the state's needs.
