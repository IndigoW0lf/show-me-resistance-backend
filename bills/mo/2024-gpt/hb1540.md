summary_short: "This bill updates rules about public access and fees for community-created geographic information systems (GIS) data in Missouri."
summary: |
  This bill allows local governments such as cities and counties to create and manage geographic information systems (GIS) to help with community planning and decision-making. It makes all information collected for these systems generally available to the public, except when itâ€™s specially kept private for valid reasons. Organizations can charge a reasonable fee for maps and data they produce, but they cannot restrict public access or make the system a private benefit. The law aims to promote transparency and access to geographic data while ensuring proper management and cost fairness.
