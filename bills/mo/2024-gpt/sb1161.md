summary_short: "This bill sets up automatic and simplified process for sealing certain criminal records after a waiting period."
summary: |
  This legislation in Missouri introduces a process called automated expungement, which will automatically close records of certain minor offenses after specific waiting periods without needing to file a petition. Starting August 28, 2027, many criminal records, such as misdemeanors, infractions, and some felonies, will be automatically closed if the individual meets certain conditions, like completing their sentence and avoiding further offenses. The law aims to give eligible individuals a fresh start by making their records inaccessible to the public, helping them move on with their lives. However, juvenile records and cases involving motor vehicle issues will not be eligible for this automatic sealing process.
