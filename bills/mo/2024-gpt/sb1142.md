summary_short: "This bill prevents government contracts from giving special treatment or discrimination based on a company's ESG scores, especially regarding fossil fuel and resource industries."

summary: |
  This bill makes it illegal for state agencies to favor or discriminate against companies based on their environmental, social, and governance (ESG) scores. It specifically targets actions like boycotting companies involved in fossil fuels, timber, mining, or large agriculture operations without a good business reason. The bill requires the state treasurer to maintain and publish a list of financial institutions that boycott these industries, and it prohibits the state from entering into banking contracts with such institutions. This aims to encourage fair treatment of companies based on business needs rather than environmental or social policies, affecting financial institutions and businesses engaged in resource-based industries.
