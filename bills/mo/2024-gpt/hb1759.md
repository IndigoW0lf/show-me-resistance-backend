summary: |
  The bill allows electricity customers in Missouri to choose whether they want to pay time-of-use rates, which vary depending on the time of day and how much electricity they use. Utility companies cannot require all customers to switch to these rates; participation is voluntary. If customers opt in, they may pay different rates during peak and off-peak times, potentially saving money or better managing their electricity usage. The goal is to give consumers more control over their electricity costs without making it a mandatory program.
