summary: |
  The bill changes the laws governing transient guest taxes in specific counties in Missouri. It allows these counties to impose a tax of up to 6% on charges for hotel rooms, bed and breakfasts, and campground cabins that are occupied for 31 days or less. This tax must be approved by voters during an election before it can be collected. The funds from this tax are intended to be used solely for promoting tourism in the county. Existing counties that already have a similar tax can now also include charges from bed and breakfast inns and campgrounds without needing a new vote.
