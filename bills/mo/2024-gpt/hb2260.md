summary_short: "This bill changes which government has legal authority over certain land parcels in Missouri, giving more control to the federal government in specific areas."

summary: |
  The bill updates laws about land in Missouri that is owned and used by the federal government. It states that the United States now has concurrent jurisdiction—meaning shared legal authority—over a federal honor farm and parts of the Ozark National Scenic Riverways. However, the law specifies that this change does not apply to the White River watershed or the Osage and St. Francois River watersheds. Essentially, this bill clarifies and adjusts where federal and state governments each have legal authority over specific lands in Missouri, which may impact land management and jurisdictional matters.
