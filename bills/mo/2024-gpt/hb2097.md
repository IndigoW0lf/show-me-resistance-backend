summary_short: "This bill changes how vehicle registrations are handled, removing model year considerations for biennial registration options."
summary: |
  This bill allows vehicle owners in Missouri to register their vehicles every two years (biennially), regardless of whether their vehicle is an even- or odd-numbered model year. Previously, vehicle registration renewal depended on the model year, but now it will be based only on the owner's choice, without considering the model year. This change applies to most passenger vehicles, but not to commercial trucks over 54,000 pounds. Vehicle owners must still provide necessary documents like proof of insurance, safety and emissions inspections, and property tax receipts when registering. The bill also authorizes the Department of Revenue to set rules for implementing these changes.
