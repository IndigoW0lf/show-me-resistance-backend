summary_short: "This law requires Missouri to check the federal drug and alcohol testing database when issuing or renewing commercial driver's licenses and to take appropriate action if a driver is found to have violated restrictions."
summary: |
  This bill updates Missouri laws regarding commercial driver’s licenses (CDLs). When someone applies for a CDL or learner’s permit, the Missouri Department of Revenue must check a federal database to confirm the applicant's eligibility, especially related to drug and alcohol restrictions. If the database shows the applicant is not allowed to operate a commercial vehicle, their license will be denied. For current drivers, the department will downgrade their license if they are found to be prohibited, but only within 60 days of receiving that information. Drivers who are prohibited cannot operate commercial vehicles until their restriction is lifted and their license is reinstated. The department can create rules to carry out these procedures, ensuring proper enforcement and record-keeping.
