summary: |
  This bill makes it illegal to knowingly distribute fake images, videos, or audio of political candidates or parties within 90 days of an election, if the media is intended to deceive or harm reputation. It requires anyone creating or sharing such media to include a clear notice if the content has been altered using artificial intelligence or digital technology. The law also allows candidates to take legal action against illegal deepfakes and imposes penalties, including fines and criminal charges, for those who violate these rules. It applies to various groups, including media creators, political groups, and individuals, to protect election integrity and honest communication.
