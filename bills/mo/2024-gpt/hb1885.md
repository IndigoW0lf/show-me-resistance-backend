summary: |
  This bill updates Missouri laws to clarify how guardian ad litem (GAL) fees are handled in cases involving abused or neglected children. It allows the court to award reasonable payment to guardians ad litem, which can be paid by either one of the parties involved or using public funds, but not from parties who have not been found to have abused or neglected a child. The bill also gives the court authority to review the background of guardians ad litem to ensure the safety of the children. Additionally, it allows for volunteer advocates to assist guardians ad litem in performing their duties. These changes aim to improve the process of protecting children and ensure fair payment for those acting in this important role while maintaining transparency and accountability.
