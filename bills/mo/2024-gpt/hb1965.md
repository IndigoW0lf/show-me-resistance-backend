summary_short: "This bill updates the rules about evidence and costs related to medical bills and damages in personal injury lawsuits."

summary: |
  This bill changes how evidence about medical costs and payments is handled in personal injury cases. It states that, before trial, if a defendant or their insurer pays part of a plaintiff's special damages, that amount cannot be recovered from the defendant during the case. The bill also defines how the actual cost of medical care is calculated, based on what has been paid or can be reasonably charged, including discounts and payments made through insurance or other agreements. These rules aim to clarify what costs can be used as evidence and ensure that payments made by defendants are properly credited, which can affect the recoveries in injury lawsuits.
