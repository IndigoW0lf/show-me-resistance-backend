summary: |
  This bill allows city and county governments in Missouri to create rules for cleaning up dangerous or unhealthy conditions on private land, such as debris, overgrown weeds, broken furniture, or hazardous materials. It outlines how authorities can notify property owners or occupants about these issues and gives them at least ten days to fix the problems. If owners do not act, the government can step in to remove the nuisances and charge the property owner for the cost. The law applies to specific types of local governments, including cities, counties, and some large counties or cities with multiple counties. It aims to help keep neighborhoods cleaner and safer by streamlining how nuisances are handled.
