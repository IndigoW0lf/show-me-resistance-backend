summary_short: "Probation officers must report any violations to the court and prosecutor by the end of the month."
summary: |
  This bill requires probation officers in Missouri to report any violations of probation to the court that originally placed the offender on probation and to the prosecutor's office. The report must be made by the last day of the month in which the violation occurred. The goal is to ensure these violations are officially documented and reported promptly. This affects probation officers, courts, prosecutors, and individuals on probation by promoting transparency and accountability in the probation process.
