summary_short: "This law bans foreign individuals and entities from funding legal cases in Missouri starting August 28, 2024."

summary: |
  The bill prevents foreign people and organizations from providing money to cover legal expenses in court cases filed in Missouri after August 28, 2024. This includes funding for lawyers and other costs, especially if the foreign party benefits financially from the case. There are some exceptions, such as if the funding comes from close family members, or if all parties agree or the court approves the funding. If a party receives illegal foreign funding, the case can be dismissed, and the court can take other actions. The goal is to prevent foreign influence or interference in Missouri's legal matters.
