summary_short: "Creates a pilot program to help working families share child care costs equally among employers, employees, and the state."

summary: |
  This bill sets up a temporary program in Missouri to make child care more affordable for working families. The program will include a subsidy that shares the cost of child care equally between employers, employees, and the state. It will be tested in at least one rural region and one urban region of the state, helping families with moderate income access quality child care. Participating child care providers must meet certain standards, and the program will include rules for how costs are shared and verified. The goal is to improve access to child care, support working families, and encourage workers to stay in the workforce. The program will be reviewed annually to assess its success and may seek additional funding through grants and donations.
