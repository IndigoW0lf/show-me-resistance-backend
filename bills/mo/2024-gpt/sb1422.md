summary: |
  The bill updates rules for electrical companies in Missouri about deferring some expenses and costs related to their electric plant investments. Specifically, if these companies choose to do so, they can set aside 100% of depreciation expenses and returns associated with certain qualifying electric plants as a regulatory asset. These deferred costs can then be included in the company's rate base in future rate cases, which may affect the rates customers pay. The goal is to allow utilities to recover costs more smoothly over time, potentially leading to more stable and predictable utility rates for consumers.
