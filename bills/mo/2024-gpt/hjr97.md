summary_short: "This bill proposes amending the Missouri Constitution to require natural resource management profits to be shared with local counties."

summary: |
  The bill, known as HJR97, suggests changing the state's constitution so that any profits made from managing natural resources—like minerals, water, or land—by state departments must be partly or fully sent back to the county where those resources are found. This means local counties could receive funds from the state's natural resource activities, helping support their communities. The law would also allow the state legislature to decide how much of these profits should be provided and the process for doing so. This change could impact state government departments, local counties, and residents who live near natural resources.
