summary_short: "This bill allows certain individuals with drug convictions who are in treatment to qualify for food assistance benefits under specific conditions."

summary: |
  This bill updates Missouri law regarding people with felony drug convictions. It provides that individuals who are participating in or have completed approved substance abuse treatment may be exempt from certain federal restrictions on food benefits. To qualify, they must meet specific criteria, such as successfully participating in treatment and obeying court orders, and must show sobriety through voluntary drug tests. The law aims to support recovery efforts while ensuring these individuals remain eligible for food assistance, but it excludes those who commit additional drug-related crimes within a year of their conviction.
