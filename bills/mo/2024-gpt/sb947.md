summary: |
  The bill modifies existing laws related to video services in Missouri. It clarifies the definition of terms like "franchise," "franchise area," and "gross revenues," which are used to regulate cable and video service providers. The bill also specifies what counts as gross revenue for taxes and fees, including recurring charges and pay-per-view, but excludes things like discounts, taxes, and equipment rentals. These changes aim to improve transparency and clarify financial reporting for companies that provide video services, affecting both cable operators and local government entities that regulate them.
