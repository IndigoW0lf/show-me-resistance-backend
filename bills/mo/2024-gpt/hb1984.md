summary: |
  The bill gives specific cities and counties in Missouri the authority to impose a transient guest tax, which is a tax on visitors staying in hotels and similar accommodations. It details which local governments can choose to implement this tax based on population size and location. The purpose of this tax is to generate funds that can be used to promote tourism and related activities, helping boost local economies. Not all areas will automatically have this power; instead, each eligible city or county must decide whether to adopt the tax. This change mainly affects local governments in selected Missouri cities and counties that want to support tourism development.
