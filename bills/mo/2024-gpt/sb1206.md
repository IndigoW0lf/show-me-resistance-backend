summary: |
  This law allows people in Missouri to get a tax credit when they purchase a new electric vehicle or a used clean vehicle that costs less than $25,000. The credit can be up to $2,500 for new electric cars or up to 10% of the price (up to $1,000) for used clean cars. The credit helps make electric vehicles more affordable and encourages more people to buy clean, environmentally friendly vehicles. It applies to individuals who pay state income tax and is available for purchases made each year from 2025 onward. The program will last for six years unless it is extended by the legislature, and any unused credits can be carried over for up to three years.
