summary_short: "This bill outlines how reinsurance contracts are handled when insurance companies are placed into conservation, rehabilitation, or liquidation in Missouri."
summary: |
  This legislation explains what happens to reinsurance agreements—contracts where one insurance company (the reinsurer) supports another (the ceding insurer)—when an insurance company faces financial trouble and is put into state-approved processes like conservation, rehabilitation, or liquidation. It states that existing reinsurance contracts will generally continue under their original terms, even during these proceedings. The bill also allows a state-backed guaranty association to step in and assume certain rights and responsibilities of the troubled insurer within 180 days of a liquidation order, helping to protect policyholders and manage outstanding claims. Overall, it aims to ensure the smooth handling of reinsurance agreements and minimize disruptions to policyholders during insurer insolvencies.
