summary_short: "Mandates enclosed trailers for transporting bulk refuse to improve waste transport cleanliness and safety, with penalties for violations."
summary: |
  This bill requires all trucks transporting large amounts of waste from waste processing facilities in Missouri to use fully enclosed trailers. Landfills are not allowed to accept bulk refuse unless it was transported in such trailers. After delivery, the trailers must be cleaned to standards set by the Department of Natural Resources. The bill also sets up checks to ensure compliance and imposes increasing fines for companies that violate these rules, eventually banning repeat offenders from entering landfills. Private citizens dumping personal waste are not affected by these requirements. This legislation aims to make waste transportation cleaner, reduce mess, and improve environmental protection.
