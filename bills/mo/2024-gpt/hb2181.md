summary_short: "This bill creates a process for law enforcement to petition courts for risk protection orders to temporarily remove firearms from individuals deemed to be a danger to themselves or others."

summary: |
  This law establishes a procedure that allows law enforcement agencies to ask a court for a risk protection order against someone they believe is a danger due to their potential to cause harm with firearms or ammunition. If approved, these orders can temporarily restrict the person’s access to guns to prevent violence or injury. The process includes filing a petition, providing notice to the respondent and relevant parties, and holding a court hearing within two weeks. It aims to improve community safety by giving law enforcement a clear method to act quickly when there is concern about someone’s dangerous behavior involving guns.
