summary_short: "This bill changes how trade-in and rebate values affect sales tax calculations on vehicles, allowing more time for owners to benefit from trade-ins."
summary: |
  This legislation updates Missouri's sales tax rules for buying vehicles, trailers, and boats when trading in an old one or receiving a rebate. It clarifies that the sales tax should only be based on the purchase price minus the trade-in or rebate amount, as shown on official sale records. The bill also sets specific time periods—either 180 days or one year, depending on age—for owners to finalize the purchase of a new vehicle after a trade-in. These changes mainly affect vehicle buyers, sellers, and dealerships by possibly reducing the sales tax they owe when using trade-ins or rebates to lower the purchase price.
