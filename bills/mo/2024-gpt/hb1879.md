summary_short: "This bill allows healthcare providers to prescribe treatment directly to the partners of people with certain sexually transmitted infections without an in-person exam."
summary: |
  This legislation updates Missouri law to let licensed healthcare professionals treat the partners of individuals diagnosed with specific sexually transmitted infections, such as chlamydia and gonorrhea, through a process called expedited partner therapy. This means providers can prescribe medication to the partner without needing a separate medical appointment or exam. The bill aims to help stop the spread of infections more quickly and easily, while providing guidance on prevention. Healthcare professionals are protected from liability when following these rules, unless they act negligently or in bad faith. The Department of Health will develop guidelines to support the implementation of this practice.
