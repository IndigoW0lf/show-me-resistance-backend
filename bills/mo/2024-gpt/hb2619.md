summary_short: "This law bans state departments from spending money on diversity, equity, and inclusion initiatives that promote preferential treatment or divisive identity politics."
summary: |
  This bill prevents state government agencies from using funds on programs or activities that focus on diversity, equity, and inclusion if they promote favoritism based on race, gender, sexual orientation, or ethnicity, or if they encourage divisive identity activism. It also stops them from supporting ideas that view disparities between groups as only due to oppression or promote collective guilt. However, state departments can still follow federal and state laws about discrimination and include requirements like the Americans with Disabilities Act. It also prohibits the government from making private companies implement or promote these types of programs to qualify for state contracts.
