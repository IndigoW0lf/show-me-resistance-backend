summary_short: "Creates the Education Stabilization Fund to help ensure funding for public schools during budget shortfalls."  
summary: |
  This bill establishes a new fund called the Education Stabilization Fund, which is meant to help keep public school funding stable. The fund collects money and is managed by the state treasurer. During times when state revenues are lower than expected, money from this fund can be used to support public school funding, making sure schools are properly funded even in tough financial times. The fund will not automatically return remaining money to other state funds at the end of a fiscal year if it exceeds a certain amount, and any excess will go back to the state's general revenue. This bill affects public school funding, the state budget process, and students across Missouri.
