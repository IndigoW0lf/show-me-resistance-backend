summary_short: "This bill stops the use of public funds to pay pharmacy benefits managers and limits their ability to charge patients for prescriptions."
summary: |
  The bill requires that pharmacy benefits managers (PBMs) cannot include contracts that make pharmacies or pharmacists require patients to pay more at the counter than their plan or cash prices. It also gives pharmacies the right to provide patients with cost information and suggest cheaper medication options without interference from PBMs. Importantly, the bill prohibits using public funds to pay PBMs, meaning the state cannot pay or contract with them. Overall, the bill aims to make prescription drug costs clearer and ensure public money is not used to support PBMs.
