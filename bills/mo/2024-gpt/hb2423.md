summary: |
  This bill makes changes to Missouri laws about who needs background checks to work with students in schools. It requires volunteers who spend time alone with students to have criminal background checks before helping out. It also mandates background checks for school staff, bus drivers, and other personnel who work directly with students or handle student records. These rules help ensure the safety of students by making sure the people working with them have been properly screened.
