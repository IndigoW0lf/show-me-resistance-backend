summary_short: "This bill allows some research expenses to be deducted from income for Missouri state taxes."
summary: |
  This bill updates Missouri's tax laws to provide a way for residents to reduce their state income taxes by deducting certain research-related expenses. It changes how Missouri calculates taxable income by adding back specific types of income and deductions that are included in federal taxes, such as some federal refunds, interest on certain government obligations, and certain business deductions. The goal is to encourage research and development activities by making these expenses more financially manageable for taxpayers involved in research. This rule applies mainly to individual taxpayers who have relevant research costs and income, affecting their overall tax bills.
