summary_short: "At least 40% of broadband development grants must go to urban areas to improve internet access."
summary: |
  This bill requires that 40% of grants for building broadband internet are dedicated to urban areas, aiming to ensure cities receive fair funding for internet expansion. It prioritizes projects that serve areas with little or no current internet service and sets clear criteria for awarding these grants, such as the ability to serve many locations efficiently, affordability, and community support. The goal is to improve internet access for more people, especially in cities, and to make sure the funding is used effectively. This affects internet providers, local governments, and residents who rely on better broadband service.
