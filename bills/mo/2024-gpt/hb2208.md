summary: |
  This bill changes the way Missouri residents' income is calculated for state taxes by adding new rules for certain income and deductions. It repeals the old law and introduces five new sections, including provisions related to law enforcement recruitment and retention. The updates clarify how federal tax refunds, interest on government obligations, and certain deductions are treated for Missouri income tax purposes. These changes aim to improve transparency and could impact law enforcement agencies, current and future officers, and taxpayers in Missouri.
