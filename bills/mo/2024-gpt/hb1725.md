summary_short: "This bill encourages local governments to issue green bonds to fund environmentally friendly projects and offers tax advantages for these bonds."

summary: |
  The bill changes rules about municipal bonds in Missouri by creating a new category called "green bonds." These bonds are used to raise money for projects that help the environment, such as renewable energy, energy efficiency, pollution reduction, sustainable land and water management, climate change adaptation, and eco-friendly buildings. To qualify as a green bond, at least 85% of the funds must go toward these environmentally beneficial projects. Additionally, interest earned from these green bonds would be exempt from state income tax, making them more attractive to investors. This bill primarily affects local governments, investors, and organizations working on environmental initiatives.
