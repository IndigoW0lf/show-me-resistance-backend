summary: |
  This legislation gives Missouri courts the authority to order individuals who are considered a high risk to themselves or others to surrender their firearms. Law enforcement can ask the court for an urgent order if they believe there is a danger of violence, even without the respondent present, and the order can last until a full hearing. If a respondent is under 18, the case is transferred to juvenile court, and guardians will be involved. The law also requires law enforcement to notify family members or others at risk and provides procedures for firearm surrender and seizure if necessary. This bill aims to prevent violence by restricting firearm access for those identified as a danger and affects individuals facing such orders, law enforcement agencies, and courts.
