summary: |
  The bill changes how industrial development corporations are organized in Missouri. It removes existing rules that only applied to Lewis County and replaces them with new, broader rules. These rules specify how the boards of directors are chosen and how many directors there are, depending on the size and location of the county or municipality. The goal is to make the rules more consistent across different areas, affecting local governments, business development efforts, and residents who are involved in or impacted by these corporations.
