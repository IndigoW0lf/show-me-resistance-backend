summary: |
  This bill updates the rules for giving inmates credit for good behavior and participation in programs while in prison. It specifies that inmates can earn up to 60 days of good time credit for completing certain educational, vocational, or treatment programs, as well as restorative justice activities. The bill also clarifies that inmates who commit major rule violations or have multiple minor violations may lose previously earned credits. Additionally, it states that inmates sentenced to death or life without parole do not qualify for these credits, and that the parole board has discretion over release dates. The changes aim to encourage positive behavior and participation in rehabilitative programs, affecting inmates, correctional staff, and the department of corrections.
