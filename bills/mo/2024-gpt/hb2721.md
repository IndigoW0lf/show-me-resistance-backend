summary: |
  The bill HB2721 updates Missouri law to provide sales tax exemptions for specific activities and facilities. It mainly benefits nuclear facilities involved in defense and security, by making certain equipment, materials, and energy sources used in manufacturing or processing exempt from sales tax. It also includes exemptions for utilities and equipment used in television or radio broadcasting, especially when used in defense contracts with the U.S. government. These changes aim to support nuclear and broadcasting industries, reducing costs for eligible organizations and contractors.
