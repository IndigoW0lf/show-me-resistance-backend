summary_short: "Missouri requires public employee retirement funds to sell any investments in specific Chinese entities or companies linked to Chinese military or security interests."
summary: |
  This law in Missouri mandates that public employee retirement systems must divest from certain Chinese companies and entities. Specifically, if these companies are listed on US government lists for being involved in activities harmful to US security or are linked to Chinese military networks, the retirement funds are required to sell off their investments in these companies. The goal is to prevent taxpayer-funded pension money from supporting businesses that pose a national security risk. This affects both the investment decisions made by the retirement system's governing board and the entities themselves. Essentially, the bill aims to limit financial ties between Missouri public employee funds and Chinese firms identified as a security concern by US authorities.
