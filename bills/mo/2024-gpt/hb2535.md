summary: |
  The bill changes the law about how parents or guardians can be penalized if their child does not attend school as required. It states that if a parent or guardian is found to have violated attendance laws, they can be fined up to $500. The law also encourages courts to consider suspending fines or imprisonment if the child is quickly enrolled and consistently attends school. The goal is to improve school attendance while providing clear penalties and options for compliance.
