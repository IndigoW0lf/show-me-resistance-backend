summary_short: "This bill creates a process to verify the credentials of community health workers in Missouri."

summary: |
  This bill defines what a community health worker is and sets up a system for the Department of Health and Senior Services to verify their credentials. Community health workers are trusted members of the community who help connect people to healthcare and social services, improve health knowledge, and support individual and community well-being. If a community health worker gets their credentials verified, they can use that credential in their work. Importantly, the bill does not require anyone to have verified credentials to work as a community health worker; it only offers a way to confirm and recognize their qualifications.
