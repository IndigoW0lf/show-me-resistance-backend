summary_short: "This bill confirms that state laws fully regulate licensed professions and limits local governments from restricting how licensed professionals practice their work."

summary: |
  This bill states that the state government has the only authority to regulate licensed professions such as doctors, lawyers, and builders. Local governments or cities cannot create rules or laws that limit, restrict, or interfere with how these professionals do their jobs. However, local governments can still handle zoning, building codes, taxes, and safety regulations, as long as these rules do not prevent licensed professionals from performing procedures or tasks that fall within their professional scope.
