summary_short: "This bill updates education laws to improve career and technical education programs for high school students in Missouri."
summary: |
  This bill requires the Missouri State Board of Education to develop a state-wide plan for career and technical education (CTE) that aligns training with workforce needs. Starting with students entering high school in the 2017-18 year, students can earn CTE certificates in addition to their high school diplomas. The bill also gives local school districts the flexibility to create CTE programs based on student interests and local job market demands, and it encourages industry-relevant standards and certifications. Additionally, the state Department of Elementary and Secondary Education will coordinate efforts to recognize school programs offering CTE certificates, supporting high school students in gaining practical skills for employment or further technical training.
