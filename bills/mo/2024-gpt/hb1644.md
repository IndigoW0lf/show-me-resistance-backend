summary: |
  The bill makes changes to Missouri's rules about child custody and support. It allows courts to order parents to pay for their child's needs based on various factors like the child's needs, the parents' finances, and living standards. The bill also clarifies when child support payments can stop, such as when the child turns 18 or 21, gets married, joins the military, or becomes self-supporting. Additionally, support can be extended if the child is disabled or still in school past age 18. These updates aim to make support arrangements clearer and fairer for families involved in divorce or separation cases.
