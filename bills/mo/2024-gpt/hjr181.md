summary_short: "This bill changes how laws created by voter initiatives can be amended or repealed by the state legislature, requiring larger votes initially and fewer later on."
summary: |
  This bill modifies the rules for how laws that are initially proposed by the people through voter initiatives can be changed or removed by the Missouri legislature. It states that in the first year after such a law is enacted, the legislature must pass any repeal or amendment with at least a three-fourths majority. In the second year, a two-thirds majority is needed. After that, only a simple majority (more than half) is required for any changes. These new rules aim to make it more difficult for the legislature to quickly undo laws that people have approved directly through voting.
