summary_short: "This bill limits government restrictions on religious places, especially during emergencies, to protect religious freedom."
summary: |
  This bill changes the rules about closing or restricting places of worship. It says that government authorities cannot close or limit religious sites unless they show there's a very strong reason connected to safety or health, and the restriction applies fairly to all religions. Importantly, during emergencies like health crises, any orders that close or limit worship places are considered too strict unless they are proven necessary. This bill aims to protect people's right to freely practice their religion, especially during emergencies, and applies to buildings like churches, mosques, synagogues, and other religious gathering places.
