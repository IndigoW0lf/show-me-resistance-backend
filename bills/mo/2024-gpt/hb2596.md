summary: |
  This bill changes the rules for child care facilities in Missouri. It requires anyone who wants to run a child care center to have a written license from the education department. The bill also clarifies which types of child care activities are exempt from licensing, such as caring for six or fewer children, religious or school-based programs, and certain emergency or short-term care. These updates help ensure safe and properly regulated child care while recognizing some organizations and situations that are exempt from licensing requirements.
