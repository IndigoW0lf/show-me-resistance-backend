summary: |
  The Missouri Homeowners' Association Act, introduced as HB2270, establishes clear rules for how homeowners' associations operate in planned communities starting January 1, 2025. It defines key terms such as lots, common expenses, and the roles of the association and its board of directors. The law aims to ensure that homeowners understand their rights and responsibilities, including how assessments are calculated and how the association manages common areas. It does not change existing rules but adds protections to promote transparency and fairness in community management.
