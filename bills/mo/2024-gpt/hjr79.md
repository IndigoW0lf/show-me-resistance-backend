summary_short: "This bill proposes an amendment to Missouri's Constitution requiring Jackson County to have an elected county assessor instead of an appointed assessment department."

summary: |
  The bill aims to change the way Jackson County manages its property assessments. Currently, the county's assessment department is not elected by voters. If approved, the amendment would require Jackson County to elect its assessor, giving residents a direct say in who manages property evaluations. This change would affect voters in Jackson County who want more direct control over local assessment decisions. The measure will be decided by voters in the November 2024 election or a special election called by the governor.
