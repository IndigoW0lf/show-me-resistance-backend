summary_short: "This bill limits local governments from creating firearm regulations and imposes penalties on officers who do, making state law the primary authority on firearm rules."
summary: |
  This bill changes the laws in Missouri to make clear that only state-level rules govern firearms, ammunition, and related supplies. It prohibits local governments like cities, towns, or counties from passing their own regulations about buying, selling, owning, or using firearms unless they directly follow specific state laws or regulations about open carry. If local officials try to make such rules, they could face a penalty of $1,000 for each violation and could be charged with a misdemeanor. The bill also states that manufacturing and selling firearms are legal activities, and certain legal protections are in place for firearm companies against lawsuits from local governments.
