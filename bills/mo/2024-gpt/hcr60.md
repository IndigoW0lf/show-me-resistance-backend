summary: |
  This bill urges Missouri's state retirement agencies to investigate the potential of investing in Bitcoin and other digital currencies through exchange-traded funds (ETFs). It recognizes the growing market and institutional interest in digital assets and suggests that the state consider these options to diversify retirement fund holdings. The bill also requires the retirement agency to work with the Treasurer's office to study the risks and benefits, and to prepare a detailed report within three months for lawmakers to review before the 2025 legislative session.
