summary_short: "This resolution urges the USDA to include Missouri in the federal hemp crop insurance program."

summary: |
  This bill is a formal request from Missouriâ€™s House of Representatives asking the U.S. Department of Agriculture to add Missouri farmers to the federal crop insurance program for industrial hemp. Although Missouri has a long history of hemp cultivation and farmers have increased their planting in recent years, they do not currently have access to federally supported crop insurance to protect their investments. Including Missouri in this program would help farmers manage risks and support the growth of the hemp industry in the state.
