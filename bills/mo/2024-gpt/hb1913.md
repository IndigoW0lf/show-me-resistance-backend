summary: |
  The bill modifies the existing Missouri Working Family Tax Credit by establishing a new tax credit for eligible taxpayers, which is based on a percentage of their federal earned income tax credit. Starting in 2023, eligible residents—such as single, head of household, widowed, or married filing jointly—who pay income taxes and qualify for the federal earned income tax credit can receive a credit against their state taxes. The percentage of the federal credit they can claim begins at 10% and can increase to 20% if certain state revenue conditions are met, but any credit that exceeds their tax liability will not be refunded or carried forward. The bill also directs the Department of Revenue to identify and notify eligible taxpayers who might qualify but haven't applied for the credit. It affects low- to moderate-income working families across Missouri, aiming to provide financial relief.
