summary_short: "This bill restores voting rights to Missourians on probation or parole after they complete their sentences."
summary: |
  This bill changes the law so that people in Missouri who are on probation or parole after a felony or misdemeanor can now vote again. Previously, individuals in this situation were not allowed to vote until they finished their sentences. The new law allows more people to regain their voting rights sooner, helping to include more citizens in elections. It affects those who have been convicted of crimes and are currently under supervision, such as probation or parole, making it easier for them to participate in democracy once they have completed their sentences.
