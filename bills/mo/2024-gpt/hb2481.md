summary_short: "This bill prevents publicly funded libraries from banning or restricting access to books or resources based on disagreement or political views."

summary: |
  The bill, known as HB2481, makes it illegal for libraries that receive federal, state, or local government funding to restrict or ban books simply because someone disapproves of their content or ideas. This means that if a library gets public money, it cannot exclude or limit access to books based on their political or ideological stance. However, the bill does not require libraries to buy or add any specific books; it only stops them from banning books after they are part of the collection. The goal is to protect free access to information and prevent censorship in publicly funded libraries.
