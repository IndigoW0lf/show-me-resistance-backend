summary: |
  This bill updates the laws in Missouri related to harming or putting highway construction workers at risk. It specifies actions that are considered offenses, such as speeding, passing illegally, not obeying traffic signals, or intentionally hitting traffic control devices in work zones. If someone commits these acts and no one is injured, they face fines up to $1,000 and points on their driver's license. The law also creates harsher penalties if the act results in injury or death of a highway worker, with fines up to $10,000 and possible criminal charges. The goal is to better protect highway workers and ensure drivers follow safety rules in construction areas.
