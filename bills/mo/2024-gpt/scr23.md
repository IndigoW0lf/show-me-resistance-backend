summary_short: "This resolution disapproves and suspends the final rule change for Missouri's Virtual Instruction Program."

summary: |
  The Missouri General Assembly has officially disapproved the final rule change proposed for the Virtual Instruction Program. The Department of Elementary and Secondary Education had submitted the amendment, but the rulemaking process did not fully follow legal requirements. As a result, the changes to how virtual education is managed will not take effect, meaning the current rules remain in place. This decision affects students and families participating in virtual learning and involves the state's education oversight department.
