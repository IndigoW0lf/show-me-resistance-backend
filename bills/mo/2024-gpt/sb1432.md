summary: |
  This bill establishes a new state commission called the Black History Education and Awareness Commission, which will promote teaching about the history, achievements, and experiences of Black people in Missouri and across the country. The commission will include education leaders, representatives from communities and civil rights groups, and experts from public and higher education. It also sets aside the first full week of February each year as Black History Week, during which schools should teach age-appropriate lessons on topics like African history, colonialism, and cultural contributions, starting from at least sixth grade. The goal is to increase awareness, understanding, and respect for Black history among students in Missouri.
