summary: |
  This bill, called the "Child Care Contribution Tax Credit Act," lets individuals and businesses in Missouri receive a tax credit for donating money, stocks, or property to registered child care providers or nonprofit organizations that support child care. The goal is to encourage more funding for child care, especially in areas that lack sufficient providers or have higher poverty rates. Taxpayers can claim a credit of 75% of their verified donations, with a minimum of $100 and a maximum based on their tax liability. This helps make child care more available and affordable for families by supporting local providers and increasing funding opportunities.
