summary: |
  This bill creates new rules for electric utilities in Missouri about how they can invest in and own parts of power generation and transmission facilities. It defines key terms like "stake," "generation facility," and "transmission facility," and sets guidelines for how these investments are valued and treated when determining electricity rates. The bill allows utility companies to request approval from the Public Service Commission before acquiring stakes in transmission lines and provides a clear process for how those investments are to be rate-regulated. If the commission does not decide on certain rate rules within 180 days, the utility's proposed rules automatically apply. This helps ensure transparency and consistency in how utility investments are handled and how costs are passed on to customers.
