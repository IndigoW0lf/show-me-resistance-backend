summary_short: "This bill updates how land surveys are recorded and stored in Missouri to improve record-keeping and legal evidence procedures."
summary: |
  The bill changes the rules for recording land surveys in Missouri. It requires surveyors to file their survey results with the county's recorder of deeds within 60 days, or alternatively with the stateâ€™s land survey program. It also sets standards for how the survey plats are maintained and indexed by the recorder of deeds. These changes help ensure that land survey records are accurate, accessible, and legally valid in court cases. Anyone involved in land ownership, real estate, or land surveying will be affected by these updates.
