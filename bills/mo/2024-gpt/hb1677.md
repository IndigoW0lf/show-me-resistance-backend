summary: |
  This bill changes the rules around student discipline in schools by prohibiting the use of seclusion—locking a student alone in a room or area—and certain types of restraints that can restrict a student's breathing or face visibility. It details what constitutes different types of restraints and clarifies that techniques which obstruct a student’s face or airway are not allowed starting from July 1, 2022. The goal is to keep students safe, prevent physical harm, and promote more humane discipline practices across schools, affecting school districts, charter schools, and private providers involved in student discipline.
