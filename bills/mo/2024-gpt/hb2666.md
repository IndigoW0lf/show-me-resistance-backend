  This bill, called HB2666, makes it illegal for the state of Missouri or its local government agencies to house undocumented migrants in airports or public schools. The only exception is if the governor declares a state of emergency due to a natural disaster or war. The law is aimed at preventing the use of government facilities for housing undocumented migrants under normal circumstances. It affects government agencies, public service providers, and undocumented migrants who might otherwise be housed in these locations.
