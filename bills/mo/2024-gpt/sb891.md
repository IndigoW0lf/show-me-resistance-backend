summary: |
  This legislation introduces a process for courts in Missouri to prevent gun violence by issuing "extreme risk protection orders." When someone is considered a serious threat, a family member, teacher, school administrator, or law enforcement can ask a court to act. If the court finds enough evidence that the person poses a danger, it can immediately order them to surrender all firearms and ban them from possessing more. The order lasts for one year, and the person is given the chance to surrender guns before any law enforcement action. The law aims to protect people by quickly removing dangerous individuals' access to firearms, especially when there's a risk of harm.
