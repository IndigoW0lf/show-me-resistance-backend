summary_short: "Allows public schools and charter schools in Missouri to employ or accept volunteer chaplains to support students."

summary: |
  This bill lets Missouri public school districts and charter schools add chaplains to their team, either as paid staff or volunteers, to help support students through various programs or services. These chaplains do not need to be certified teachers. Before they start working or volunteering, they must pass a criminal background check, and they cannot be registered sex offenders. School boards and charter governing bodies will vote by March 1, 2025, on whether to adopt policies allowing chaplains at their schools.
