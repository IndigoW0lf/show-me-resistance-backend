summary: |
  This legislation removes existing laws that oversee industrial inspections carried out by the State's Inspection Section. It eliminates regulations related to the director's duties, office locations, staffing, and salary provisions. As a result, the state will no longer have specific legal requirements for inspecting industries, which could affect safety oversight and reporting in industrial facilities across Missouri.
