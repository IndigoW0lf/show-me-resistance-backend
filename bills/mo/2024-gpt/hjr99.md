summary_short: "This bill proposes a constitutional change to limit how and when the Missouri General Assembly can amend or repeal laws approved by voters through initiatives."

summary: |
  The bill aims to restrict the power of the Missouri General Assembly to change laws that voters have approved through the initiative process. Under the proposed amendment, once a statutory measure is approved by a majority of voters, it cannot be amended or repealed by the legislature unless certain conditions are metâ€”such as waiting more than six years, obtaining a three-fourths majority in both chambers for changes, or getting voters' approval again. This change is designed to strengthen voter control over laws they support and limit legislative interference. It affects voters, lawmakers, and anyone interested in how laws are enacted and maintained in Missouri.
