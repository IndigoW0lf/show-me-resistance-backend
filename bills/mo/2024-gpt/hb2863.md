summary: |
  The bill enables certain small villages in Missouri—those with populations between 52 and 61 residents—to impose a special tax of up to 6% on hotel stays and short-term rentals within the village. This tax would be used specifically for economic development projects and local infrastructure improvements. Before the tax can be collected, residents of the village must vote on whether to approve it during an election. If approved, the tax would start in the second quarter after the election. The goal is to give small communities a way to raise funds for community improvements, but only if the local residents agree to it through a vote.
