summary_short: "This bill changes how the number of students attending school (called 'weighted average daily attendance') is calculated for education funding in Missouri."

summary: |
  This bill updates the way Missouri schools calculate the average number of students attending each day, which affects how much money they receive from the state. It clarifies the method for counting students who attend summer school and students attending schools outside their home districts if their parent works there. The bill also revises the definition of "current operating expenditures" used for funding calculations, based on data from previous years. These changes aim to make funding calculations clearer and potentially more accurate, impacting school districts' budgets and funding levels.
