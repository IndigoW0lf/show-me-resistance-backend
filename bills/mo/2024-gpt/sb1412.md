summary_short: "This bill creates the Ebony Alert System to help find missing or kidnapped Black youth in Missouri."

summary: |
  This bill establishes a new statewide alert system called the Ebony Alert System, designed to assist in locating missing or abducted Black youth under the age of 25. It includes specific criteria for who qualifies, such as victims of kidnapping or human trafficking. The system involves cooperation between state agencies, law enforcement, and local broadcasters like TV and radio stations. Participation is voluntary for law enforcement and broadcasters, but if an agency chooses not to set up the system and an abduction occurs, the state will notify local media to help spread the alert. The goal is to improve the speed and reach of alerts for these vulnerable youth, helping bring them home safely.
