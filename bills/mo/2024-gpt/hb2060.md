summary_short: "This bill clarifies that the state has authority over tobacco product regulations, overriding local rules."
summary: |
  The bill changes the law to specify that the state of Missouri controls the rules about selling tobacco, nicotine, and vapor products. It removes previous rules that allowed local governments, like counties and cities, to set their own stricter rules. Now, only the state can make and enforce laws about these products, meaning local rules cannot be more restrictive than state law. This affects businesses that sell these products and local governments that may want to regulate them more tightly.
