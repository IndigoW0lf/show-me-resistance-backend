summary: |
  The "Protect Young Minds Online Act" requires internet service providers in Missouri to give new and existing residential customers the option to filter out adult and inappropriate websites. When you sign up for internet service or renew your subscription each year, providers must ask whether you want to enable or disable website filtering. The filtering system must meet industry standards to block content like child pornography and explicit sexual material, and it can be managed by an independent third party. If providers don't follow these rules, the Attorney General can take legal action. This law mainly affects internet users in Missouri and the companies that provide internet service.
