summary: |
  This bill, called the "Community Police Tax Credit," offers a $3,000 tax credit to eligible law enforcement officers who live in areas with high crime rates and work in designated community policing zones. It helps recognize officers committed to improving safety in their communities and encourages officers to reside in these areas. The bill also defines how high-crime areas will be identified and requires state agencies to report crime data to determine eligibility. Only officers who meet the residency and work location criteria can claim this tax credit, which is refundable and cannot be carried over to future years.
