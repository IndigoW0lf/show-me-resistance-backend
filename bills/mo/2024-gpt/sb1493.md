summary: |
  This bill, called the "Powering Missouri's Future Act," revises regulations related to constructing and financing nuclear power plants in Missouri. It creates new rules about how costs for nuclear facilities are treated for rate-setting and taxation purposes, especially for plants placed into operation after August 28, 2024. The bill allows electrical companies to form subsidiaries to build and operate these nuclear plants, and all costs incurred by these subsidiaries will be considered as if the electrical company incurred them directly. It also sets the stage for the Public Service Commission to review and decide on the best ways to finance new nuclear energy projects. Overall, the bill aims to support the development of clean, nuclear energy in Missouri while providing clear rules for cost recovery and project ownership.
