summary: |
  This bill changes the rules about what local governments, like cities or counties, can do regarding employment laws. It states that local governments cannot require employers to pay higher wages or provide more benefits than what state law already requires. However, they can still create rules about employment discrimination and background checks related to licensing. The bill also prevents local governments from controlling wages or employment terms through their contracts with vendors. Overall, it aims to ensure that employment regulations stay consistent across the state and are primarily governed by state law, affecting local governments, employers, and workers.
