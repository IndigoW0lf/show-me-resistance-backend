summary_short: "This bill allows certain fathers to be legally responsible for child support payments for their unborn children under specific conditions."

summary: |
  This law sets rules about child support for unborn children. If a mother requests support within two years of her child's birth and includes support for the pregnancy months, the alleged or presumed father may be required to pay child support starting six weeks after conception. The exact amount of support is decided by the court, considering what's best for the mother and the baby. If paternity is confirmed after the child is born to someone other than the putative father, he can seek reimbursement for any support he paid. This law mainly impacts expectant mothers, potential fathers, and the family court system.
