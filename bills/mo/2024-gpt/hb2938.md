summary_short: "This bill creates a new system for awarding school districts more flexibility based on their performance through earned autonomy waivers."
summary: |
  This bill establishes a new process in Missouri where school districts can earn different levels of autonomy based on five years of academic and community performance scores. Districts with high scores (90 or above for three years) can qualify for "earned autonomy" waivers, giving them more freedom from certain state rules. Those with lower scores qualify for expanded or no autonomy, depending on their performance. The law also creates a council to develop how these scores are calculated, considering academic results and community feedback, affecting schools and districts across the state.
