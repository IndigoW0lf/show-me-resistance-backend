summary_short: "This bill sets strict rules for how animals like dogs and cats can be put to sleep at shelters, using only humane methods approved by veterinarians."

summary: |
  This legislation establishes that animal shelters and control agencies in Missouri must use only specific, humane methods to euthanize dogs and cats. The primary method authorized is injecting sodium pentobarbital or a similar approved drug. The bill also allows for the use of other humane substances if there is a shortage of sodium pentobarbital, as determined by the state's veterinary authority. It prohibits other methods such as gas chambers with carbon monoxide, electrocution, gunshot, blunt trauma, or injections of neuromuscular blocking agents unless explicitly allowed. Only trained veterinarians or licensed physicians can carry out these euthanasia procedures. The goal is to ensure that animals are euthanized in a humane way, reducing suffering and promoting ethical practices in animal care facilities.
