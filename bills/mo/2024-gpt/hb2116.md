summary: |
  This bill clarifies the rules for caring for young people in foster care who have complex medical, emotional, or behavioral problems. It introduces the categories of "youth with elevated needs-level A" and "level B" to identify children who need more structured and skilled care than traditional foster homes. The bill defines which behaviors and diagnoses qualify a youth for these specialized placements and explains the process for assessing their suitability. It also addresses how to handle sibling groups where multiple children need this type of care, ensuring they are placed together when appropriate. Overall, the bill aims to improve support and placement options for the most vulnerable foster youth in Missouri.
