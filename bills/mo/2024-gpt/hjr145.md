summary_short: "This bill proposes a constitutional amendment to clarify and extend gun rights in Missouri, including regulations for cities and counties."
summary: |
  The bill aims to change the Missouri Constitution to reaffirm that citizens have an unalienable right to keep and bear arms for self-defense, property protection, and in support of civil authority. It also sets rules allowing cities like St. Louis and Kansas City to create local laws regulating the possession, carrying, and transfer of firearms, including permit systems and penalties. These local laws can include fees, background checks, and enforcement measures, with certain exemptions for law enforcement, judges, security personnel, and military members. If approved by voters in November 2024, these changes would impact how gun rights are protected and regulated across the state and within cities.
