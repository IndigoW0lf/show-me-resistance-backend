summary: |
  This bill changes the laws about how self-storage businesses handle unpaid bills. It states that storage operators have a legal right (a lien) on stored personal belongings if the renter owes rent or other charges. The bill specifies that the owner must notify the renter and any lienholders 45 days before selling the property. If the renter is in default for more than 45 days, the operator can sell the stored items either at a public or private sale, following fair and reasonable procedures. Proceeds from the sale will first go to cover the unpaid charges, and any leftover money will be held for the renter for one year before being sent to the state. The bill helps make the process clearer and more consistent for storage operators, renters, and lienholders.
