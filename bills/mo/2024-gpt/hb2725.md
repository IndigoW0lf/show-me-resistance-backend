summary_short: "This bill prevents hospitals and employers from using noncompete clauses to restrict doctors from practicing medicine after leaving their jobs."

summary: |
  This bill makes it illegal for healthcare employers in Missouri to include noncompete agreements in employment contracts with doctors. A noncompete clause is a rule that tries to stop a doctor from working in a certain area for a period of time after they leave a job. The law aims to protect doctors' ability to find new work and ensure patients have access to healthcare options. However, the bill does not affect other parts of the employment contract that are not related to practicing medicine.
