summary_short: "This bill makes food sales tax-exempt in Missouri, meaning you won't pay sales tax when buying most food items."
summary: |
  The bill SB1252 repeals existing laws and establishes that retail sales of food are no longer subject to sales tax in Missouri. It defines "food" as items eligible for food stamp benefits and those dispensed through vending machines, but excludes sales from restaurants and similar establishments where most income comes from prepared food for immediate consumption. This change lowers the cost of groceries for consumers by removing sales tax on most food purchases, affecting shoppers across the state and having an impact on revenue collected from food sales tax.
