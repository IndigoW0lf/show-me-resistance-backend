summary_short: "This bill updates the rules for the Waterways and Ports Trust Fund in Missouri to clarify its funding, use, and expiration date."
summary: |
  The bill creates a new version of the Waterways and Ports Trust Fund in Missouri's state treasury. It allows the fund to receive money from state appropriations, grants, gifts, and other sources. The fund is designed to support projects that improve transportation and commerce along Missouri's navigable rivers, such as port and terminal upgrades. These projects must meet specific criteria, including location, funding, and completion timeline, and the fund can be used as part of other grant applications. The bill also sets an expiration date for the fund, which will end on August 28, 2033, with remaining funds transferring to the state's general revenue after that date.
