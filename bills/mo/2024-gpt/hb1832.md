summary_short: "This bill makes military personnel and their families eligible for in-state college tuition in Missouri."

summary: |
  The bill clarifies that military personnel stationed in Missouri, along with their spouses and children under 24, are considered residents for college tuition purposes. It also states that members of the Missouri National Guard and military reserves are automatically deemed residents of Missouri for both undergraduate and graduate programs at public colleges and universities. This means these individuals can pay in-state tuition rates, which are generally lower than out-of-state rates. The bill aims to support military families and veterans by making higher education more affordable for those serving in or connected to the stateâ€™s military community.
