summary_short: "This bill gives certain Missouri state employees with low to moderate incomes a tax exemption on their wages."
summary: |
  Starting in 2025, Missouri will not impose income tax on the wages of state employees whose earnings are at or below six times the federal poverty guidelines. This means that if a state employee's income from their government job is low enough, they won't have to pay state income tax on that amount. The bill applies only to employees of state agencies, departments, or government units, but not to elected officials, contractors, or local government workers. It aims to help lower-income state employees keep more of their earnings and provides a clear threshold for tax exemption based on federal poverty levels.
