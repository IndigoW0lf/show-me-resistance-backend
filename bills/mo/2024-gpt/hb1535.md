summary: |
  This bill changes the law to make it illegal for anyone under 18 years old to have a firearm while on public property. Previously, laws about illegal firearm possession mainly focused on adults and certain situations. Now, minors caught with a firearm on public property can be charged, unless they are with an adult over 21, participating in school or lawful activities, or hunting legally. It also updates penalties based on whether the person has prior serious offenses. The goal is to improve safety and clarify rules for minors with firearms in public spaces.
