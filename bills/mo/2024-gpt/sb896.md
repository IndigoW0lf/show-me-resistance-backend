summary: |
  This bill makes changes to Missouri laws regarding the assessment and taxation of utility-related properties, especially solar energy projects. Starting January 1, 2025, solar energy properties built before the end of 2024 will be valued differently for tax purposes, with some projects considered to have minimal value or limited tax liability. The bill also clarifies that existing tax agreements and incentives for energy projects remain unaffected. Additionally, it sets limits on property tax liability for solar properties and includes provisions about business personal property and obsolescence. Overall, the bill aims to make the tax process clearer for solar energy projects and utilities, while maintaining certain incentives and existing agreements.
