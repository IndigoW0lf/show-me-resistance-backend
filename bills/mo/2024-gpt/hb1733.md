summary_short: "This bill requires referral agencies to disclose their relationships and fees when referring people to assisted living facilities and sets rules to protect consumers."
summary: |
  This legislation makes rules for companies or individuals that connect people with assisted living facilities in Missouri. These referral agencies must share details about their relationship with the facilities, including any ownership or financial ties, and inform prospective residents if they will receive a fee for the referral. They also need to provide written agreements that explain residents' rights to cancel and how cancellations are communicated. Assisted living facilities must verify they have received this information before accepting new residents and cannot pay referral fees until they do. The law aims to increase transparency and protect people looking for assisted living options from potential unfair practices.
