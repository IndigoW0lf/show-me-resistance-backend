summary: |
  This bill requires that from January 1, 2030, every handgun sold in Missouri must be equipped with smart technology. This technology will restrict who can use the firearm, using biometric data such as fingerprints or facial recognition. The goal is to improve safety by making it harder for unauthorized people to operate guns. The bill also updates rules about firearm possession, including stricter penalties for illegal possession by certain individuals, but it exempts antique firearms. The new laws aim to reduce gun violence and ensure safer firearm use for the public.
