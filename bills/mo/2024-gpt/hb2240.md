summary: |
  The bill establishes the "Rural Workforce Housing Investment Act" to encourage the building and repairing of housing in rural communities with populations under 50,000. It allows nonprofit organizations approved by the state to create housing investment funds, which can receive cash investments from various sources like individuals, businesses, and local governments. These funds will support projects such as new housing construction, repairs, and upper-story housing for working families. The goal is to make affordable, attractive housing options available to support workers and attract new residents in rural Missouri communities.
