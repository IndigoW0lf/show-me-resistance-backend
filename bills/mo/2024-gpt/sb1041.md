summary: |
  This legislation revises Missouri's rules for tax credits that encourage businesses to contribute to community programs. It allows a larger portion of contributions—up to 70%—to be credited against certain taxes, compared to the previous limit of 50%. The bill also sets new caps on the total amounts of these credits that can be issued each year, starting at four million dollars in 1999 and increasing to six million dollars in 2000 and beyond. These changes are meant to incentivize more philanthropic contributions to community development efforts, especially in smaller or rural areas. The bill impacts businesses and financial institutions that donate to approved programs, as they can benefit from larger tax credits and overall greater support for community projects.
