summary_short: "This bill allows the Missouri Department of Transportation to partner with private internet providers to expand fiber-optic networks, especially in areas with little or no service."

summary: |
  The bill gives the Missouri Department of Transportation (often called MoDOT) the authority to work with private companies to build and improve fiber-optic internet networks across the state. Their main focus is on expanding internet access in areas that currently lack service or have limited coverage. The process for creating these partnerships will be open and competitive, with public notices published in newspapers and trade magazines. At least 25% of the work for these projects must be done by workers from racial minority groups. Additionally, private companies can use the fiber capacity to offer internet services that meet state quality standards. This bill aims to improve internet access for more Missourians through collaborations between the government and private companies.
