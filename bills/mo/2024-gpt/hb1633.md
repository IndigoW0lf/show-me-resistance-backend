  This bill improves transparency in Missouri's government spending by adding details about estimated costs and settlement claims to the state's online accountability portal. It requires the portal to be updated daily and serve as the main source of financial activity information. The bill also specifies how and when different government agencies, schools, and subdivisions must report information about bonds, obligations, and debts, including those issued before August 28, 2013. Additionally, it ensures that the public can see details about funds withheld or released from the state's budget, making government financial actions clearer and easier to track.
