summary: |
  This bill modifies the process for approving amendments to the Missouri Constitution. It clarifies that amendments proposed by the legislature or through citizen initiatives will be voted on separately during general or special elections. The bill also specifies how these amendments should be published in newspapers for public review and sets requirements for voter eligibility, such as being a Missouri resident and U.S. citizen. Additionally, it streamlines the process for proposing and approving amendments made by constitutional conventions, including how they are submitted to voters and when they take effect. These changes aim to make the amendment process clearer and more organized for voters and government officials in Missouri.
