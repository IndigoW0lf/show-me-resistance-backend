summary: |
  This bill explains how the state handles situations where a child might be in danger at home. It states that if a child is removed for the first time because authorities suspect abuse or neglect, the child will go to a foster home, and the parent has 12 months to complete a state-paid training or rehab program to regain custody. If the parent successfully completes the program, they can get their child back and will have supervised visits for a year. If a child is removed again, the parent has only 6 months to complete the program, and if they do, they can regain custody with supervised visits for six months. After a third removal, the child will be placed for adoption, and the parent must give up their rights to the child. The goal is to protect children while giving parents opportunities to fix issues that threaten their child's safety.
