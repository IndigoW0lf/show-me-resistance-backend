summary: |
  This bill changes the way the police retirement system in St. Louis calculates \"average final compensation,\" which is used to determine retirement benefits. It specifies different calculation methods based on a memberâ€™s service history and participation in the Deferred Retirement Option Plan (DROP). The goal is to clarify and adjust the formula for computing retirement benefits depending on when and how officers served and participated in retirement programs. These changes will impact police officers' retirement calculations, especially those with varied service timelines around October 1, 2001.
