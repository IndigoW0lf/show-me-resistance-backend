summary_short: "This bill changes rules about lawsuits and insurance for long-term care and health care providers in Missouri."
summary: |
  The bill updates laws related to legal actions against health care providers, including long-term care facilities, and how their insurance rates are set. It repeals some old sections and creates new rules that define what counts as a health care provider and insurer, and how insurance companies can determine their rates. It also restricts insurance companies from selling policies that cover damages for injuries or deaths caused by health care services if the rates are found to be too high, too low, or unfairly charged. This helps ensure fairness and financial stability in health care insurance and malpractice coverage for providers in Missouri.
