summary: |
  This bill requires all public schools in Missouri to keep a record of specific incidents that require official reports. These reports must be sent to the Department of Elementary and Secondary Education within 30 days. The department will then compile all these incident reports into its data system and make the information available to the public through the Missouri comprehensive data system, ensuring transparency. Personal identifying information will not be included to protect privacy. The goal is to give the public clear and timely information about incidents happening in schools.
