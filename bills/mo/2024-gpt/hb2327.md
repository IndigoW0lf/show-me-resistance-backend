summary_short: "This bill bans public schools and charter schools in Missouri from being members of or paying dues to certain statewide activity associations that allow private schools to compete in post-season or tournament athletic events."

summary: |
  The bill prohibits public school districts and charter schools from joining or paying fees to statewide activities associations if those associations permit private schools to participate in playoff or tournament-style athletic competitions against public schools. The goal is to prevent private schools from having an unfair advantage or participating in public school athletic events under certain conditions. This change mainly affects the organizations that manage student activities and the public schools and charter schools that may have previously been members or pay dues to these associations.
