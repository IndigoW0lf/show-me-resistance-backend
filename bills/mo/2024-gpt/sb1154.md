summary: |
  The Missouri School Meals Act requires schools to provide free lunches to students who qualify for reduced-price meals under federal programs. It also sets up a new fund, called the School Meals Fund, to help pay for these meals, with the state reimbursing schools for the difference in costs. Schools will determine which students are eligible and help families apply, while ensuring students' privacy and avoiding stigmatization. The law applies to various types of schools, including public, private, and charter schools, that participate in federal meal programs. It is designed to support students' nutritional needs while managing the costs for schools through state funding.
