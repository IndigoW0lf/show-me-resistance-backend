summary_short: "This law bans public entities in Missouri from contracting with companies that participate in economic boycotts based on their energy, firearm, environmental, or social policy stances."
summary: |
  This bill prohibits government agencies and public institutions in Missouri from entering into contracts with companies that engage in economic boycotts related to certain industries or social issues. Specifically, companies cannot be penalized or refused contracts for activities like fossil fuel production, firearm sales, or failing to meet specific environmental or social standards. The law requires companies to certify they are not currently involved in, and will not engage in, such boycotts during the term of their contracts. It aims to prevent the government from doing business with companies for their positions on energy, firearms, environmental policies, or social issues like abortion and gender rights. The bill also gives the attorney general authority to enforce these rules and investigate potential violations.
