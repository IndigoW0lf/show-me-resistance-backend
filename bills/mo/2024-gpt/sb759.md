summary_short: "This bill allows customers in Missouri to choose whether to pay for electricity rates that vary by time of day."
summary: |
  The bill makes it optional for electricity customers to pay time-of-use rates, which are prices that change depending on the time of day and how much electricity is used. The utility companies cannot require customers to use these rates; instead, customers must voluntarily agree (opt-in) if they want to pay based on these time-of-use rates. This gives consumers more control over their electricity billing options and helps them decide if they want to save money or manage their energy use better.
