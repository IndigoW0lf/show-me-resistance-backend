summary: |
  The bill sets up a new program in specific large cities in Missouri that aren't part of a county or are big cities crossing multiple counties. These cities will create special funds to collect money from people who want to help reduce homelessness. People will be able to donate money by sending a text message to a designated phone number. The cities will manage the funds, which will only be used for services aimed at helping homeless individuals. The state will also provide initial funding for signs to promote the donation program in areas with many homeless residents.
