  This bill sets rules for what can and can't be taught in public schools in Missouri.

Schools are not allowed to teach theories like the 1619 Project or critical race theory. Teachers are also restricted from assigning students to politically active projects or discussing controversial topics in a biased way. Additionally, the bill emphasizes teaching students about American history and government foundations, focusing on civics, the Constitution, and the importance of civic engagement.
