summary: |
  This bill makes important changes to Missouri's safety laws. It states that employers cannot fire workers just because they keep a firearm in their car on company property, as long as the vehicle is locked, the firearm is not visible, and the employee is lawfully allowed to have a gun. It also clarifies when and how people can use force or deadly force to protect themselves or others, including specific rules about defending against unlawful entries and threats. These updates aim to balance personal safety rights with lawful use of firearms and self-defense, affecting employees, firearm owners, law enforcement, and the criminal justice system.
