summary: |
  This bill changes existing laws in Missouri related to gender transition treatments for people under 18. It removes the temporary expiration date, meaning the restrictions on using gender-affirming surgery and hormones for minors will now be permanent. The law prevents healthcare providers from performing gender transition surgery and prescribing certain medications like hormones or puberty blockers to anyone under 18. It affects transgender young people who might want these treatments and the doctors who provide them.
