summary: |
  This bill changes the rules around youth employment in Missouri. It no longer requires children under 18 to get a work certificate or permit from government agencies, making it easier for teens to start working. Instead, parents or guardians simply need to fill out a permission form that the employer keeps on file â€” no need for official government authorization. The bill also clarifies rules for children working in the entertainment industry, including documenting age and ensuring that parents or guardians approve their participation. Overall, these changes aim to reduce bureaucratic hurdles for young workers and make employment more accessible for minors.
