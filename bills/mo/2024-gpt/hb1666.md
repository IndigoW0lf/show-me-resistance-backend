summary_short: "This bill allows dietitians in Missouri to issue short-term, temporary licenses to new practitioners under supervision without requiring the applicant to pass an exam."
summary: |
  The bill creates a new process for individuals wanting to practice dietetics in Missouri who haven't yet taken or passed the licensing exam. These individuals can apply for a temporary license, which is nonrenewable, by working under the supervision of a licensed dietitian. The supervising dietitian must have at least one year of active practice and cannot be a close family member of the temporary licensee. The temporary license is valid for up to 180 days or until the new practitionerâ€™s employment ends. This change aims to help new dietitians start practicing more easily and safely while ensuring proper supervision and licensing standards are maintained.
