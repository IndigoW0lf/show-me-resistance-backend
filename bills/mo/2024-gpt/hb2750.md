summary: |
  This bill, called the Accessible Prescription Labels Act, requires pharmacies to notify customers that accessible labels are available. If a customer identifies as blind, visually impaired, or print-disabled, the pharmacy must provide a special label that they can read using their preferred method, such as large print, Braille, or audio. The accessible label must be provided quickly, match the duration of the prescription, and include all necessary safety information. Pharmacies must also ensure that any device used to read the label is compatible with these accessible labels. This law aims to make medication information easier to access for people with print disabilities, helping improve their safety and independence.
