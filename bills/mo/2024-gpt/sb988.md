summary: |
  This bill changes the laws governing qualified spousal trusts in Missouri. It clarifies how property in these trusts can be held, either jointly or in separate shares for each spouse, and who can access the trust assets during their lifetimes. The bill gives these trusts protection from creditors similar to that of tenants by the entirety, meaning they are generally safe from a spouse's creditors during the spouses' lives. It also explains that this protection ends if the marriage is legally dissolved. Overall, the bill helps married couples better manage and protect their property through these special trusts.
