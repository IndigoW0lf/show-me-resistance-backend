summary: |
  This bill clarifies the procedures for law enforcement, doctors, and juvenile officers to act when they believe a child is being harmed or is in danger. It allows these professionals to take a child into temporary protective custody immediately if they think the child is in serious danger, even without the parents' consent, but only for up to 24 hours unless a court orders more time. The bill also sets rules for how quickly a child must be returned to their parents or taken to court for protection proceedings. It aims to improve immediate safety measures for children while ensuring proper legal processes are followed.
