summary: |
  The bill, called SJR50, aims to change the Missouri Constitution by allowing the state to set an income tax rate up to 5.5% and by preventing the expansion of sales and use taxes to new types of services or transactions that were not taxed as of January 1, 2015. It also specifies that any new sales tax starting after January 1, 2025, should be offset by a reduction in the state's income tax rate, maintaining overall revenue levels. These changes will be put to voters in the November 2024 election. The goal is to control tax increases on residents and limit the growth of sales taxes on certain digital and online purchases.
