summary_short: "This bill proposes a constitutional amendment to exempt certain disabled veterans from paying property taxes in Missouri."

summary: |
  This bill aims to let qualified disabled veterans in Missouri avoid paying property taxes on their homes and other real property. It will be on the November 2024 ballot for voters to approve or reject. If approved, these veterans—specifically those with service-related disabilities—will be able to keep more of their property value without tax burdens, providing them financial relief. The change also clarifies existing property tax laws and sets rules for how local governments will replace lost revenue from these exemptions.
