  This bill creates a new tax credit in Missouri to encourage the purchase and rehabilitation of run-down or abandoned properties. First-time home buyers who meet specific income and residency requirements can receive a $5,000 credit on their state taxes when they buy a qualifying property. The property must have been vacant for at least six months and be considered blighted or unsafe by local authorities. This program aims to help improve neighborhoods, promote affordable housing, and support new homeowners in Missouri.
