summary: |
  The Marilyn Teitelbaum Death with Dignity Act is a new law in Missouri that permits adults who are diagnosed with a terminal illness and are considered competent to make their own healthcare decisions to choose to end their life peacefully. Under this law, patients can request and obtain prescribed medication that they may take themselves to hasten death, provided they meet specific legal and medical requirements. The bill sets clear definitions for key terms and outlines the procedures involving doctors and mental health evaluations to ensure the patient's decision is informed and voluntary. It is designed to give terminally ill patients more control over how they handle their end-of-life care, while ensuring safeguards are in place for their safety and well-being.
