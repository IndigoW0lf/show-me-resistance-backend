summary_short: "This law prohibits Missouri officials and agencies from enforcing or receiving federal orders to seize firearms from law-abiding citizens, protecting gun owners' rights locally."
summary: |
  The Anti-Red Flag Gun Seizure Act states that any federal court order to take away a person's guns is considered an infringement on the right to bear arms, as protected by both the U.S. and Missouri constitutions. It also bans Missouri state and local agencies from assisting with or funding efforts to enforce federal gun confiscation laws or court orders. This means local police and agencies cannot enforce or support federal actions that aim to take away firearms based on federal orders, and they cannot receive federal funds for such enforcement. The law primarily aims to protect the rights of gun owners in Missouri by preventing state and local officials from participating in federal gun confiscation efforts.
