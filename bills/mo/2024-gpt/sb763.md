summary_short: "This bill automates the process of sealing certain criminal records in Missouri after a set period, making records inaccessible to the public."
summary: |
  The bill introduces a system for automatically closing certain criminal records in Missouri, starting August 28, 2027. If a person completes their sentence and meets specific criteria, their court and administrative records for eligible offenses will be sealed without needing to petition the court. This helps individuals move on from past offenses, making it easier to find housing, jobs, and opportunities. However, juvenile cases and motor vehicle offenses are not eligible for automatic expungement. The law also sets specific timeframes for record closure based on the type of offense and the person's age or circumstances.
