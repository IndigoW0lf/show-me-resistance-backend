summary_short: "This law would prevent the state legislature from changing or repealing approved voter initiatives unless voters agree again through a referendum."

summary: |
  This bill changes the Missouri Constitution to make it clear that once voters approve a new law through an initiative, the state legislature cannot later modify or cancel that law unless voters approve a new referendum. Essentially, if citizens gather enough support to pass a law directly through a ballot measure, the legislature cannot undo it without going back to voters for approval. This affects how flexible the government can be in adjusting laws passed by voters and aims to give more power to the voters to keep their approved initiatives in place.
