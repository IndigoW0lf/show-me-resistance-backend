summary: |
  The bill proposes amending Missouri's constitution to restrict how initiatives and laws can be proposed through citizen petitions. It bans foreign governments and political parties from sponsoring, funding, or making contributions to initiatives. Additionally, it limits certain taxes, such as food sales tax and property taxes, from being raised through citizen initiatives. It also clarifies that constitutional amendments must be approved by voters in a majority of states and districts, and gives the legislature authority to enforce these rules. These changes aim to increase transparency and prevent foreign influence in state lawmaking, affecting all voters and organizations involved in ballot measures.
