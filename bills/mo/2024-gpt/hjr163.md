summary_short: "Proposes a Missouri constitutional amendment to strengthen gun rights and allow local regulation of firearms within limits."

summary: |
  This bill suggests changing the Missouri Constitution to explicitly guarantee the right of all citizens to keep and bear arms, including ammunition and accessories, for defending themselves, their families, and property. It also states that any restrictions on this right must be carefully tested and that the state must protect these rights from infringement. Additionally, it allows cities like Kansas City and St. Louis to create their own laws regulating firearms, including issuing permits and setting penalties, with certain exemptions for law enforcement, judges, and security personnel. The change aims to clarify gun rights and give local governments the ability to regulate firearms within defined boundaries.
