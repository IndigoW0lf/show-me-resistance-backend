summary_short: "This law makes employers responsible for damages if an employee is injured by a required immunization."
summary: |
  This bill, known as the "Required Immunization Liability Act," states that if an employer makes an employee get an immunization as a condition of their job, the employer can be held responsible for any injuries or damages the employee suffers from that immunization. Essentially, employers are liable if the employee experiences harm that is solely due to the requirement to be vaccinated. This law affects workplaces where immunizations are required and provides protection for employees in case of vaccine-related injuries caused by their employerâ€™s mandates.
