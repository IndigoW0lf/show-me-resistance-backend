summary_short: "This bill bans the use of state and federal funds to pay for abortions or support abortion facilities in Missouri."

summary: |
  This bill prohibits the use of public funds, including taxpayer money and government resources, from being spent on abortion services or facilities that provide abortions. It also ensures that public funds are used to promote childbirth instead of abortion, and protects individuals and organizations from being forced to fund or participate in abortions against their beliefs. The bill gives taxpayers and the state the right to challenge violations and restricts federal regulations that could require Missouri to fund or support abortions. It mainly affects government agencies, taxpayers, and health care providers by enforcing restrictions on funding for abortion-related services.
