summary: |
  This bill changes the rules about who can buy and own real estate and farmland in Missouri. Starting August 28, 2024, people and companies that are not U.S. citizens, residents, or created under U.S. laws will not be allowed to purchase or own commercial real estate or farmland in the state. Existing owners who acquired property before this date can keep their land but cannot sell or transfer it to foreign buyers after August 28, 2024. The bill also limits foreign ownership of agricultural land across the state to no more than 1% of Missouri's total farmland, with some exceptions for land near Oklahoma and property owned before 1995. Overall, this bill tightens restrictions on foreign individuals and companies regarding real estate and farm land in Missouri.
