summary_short: "This bill limits how hospitals and clinics can include non-compete agreements with doctors in Missouri."

summary: |
  The bill defines rules for agreements called "covenants not to compete" that some employers might require physicians to sign. It states that such agreements are only valid if they are made with doctors working in clinical settings and if the employer is not a nonprofit health care organization. The law also limits these non-compete agreements so they can't last more than one year and can't restrict the doctor from working within more than fifty miles of their current office. Overall, this bill aims to protect physicians' ability to work and move freely within a reasonable area after leaving a job.
