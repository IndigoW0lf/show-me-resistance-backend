summary_short: "This bill proposes changes to how property taxes are assessed and limits increases in property values for tax purposes."
summary: |
  This bill aims to update Missouri's rules for assessing property taxes, especially for residential property. Starting in 2025, the assessed value of residential homes will generally stay the same as the most recent assessment unless there are new improvements or the property has increased in value due to inflation, which will be capped at 2% per year or the change in the consumer price index. The bill also defines different property classes, how they are taxed, and limits the maximum percent of true value that can be used for assessments. These changes could affect homeowners, property owners, and local governments by potentially making property tax increases more predictable and controlled.
