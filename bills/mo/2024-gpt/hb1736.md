  This law updates the rules for who can be excused from serving on a jury in Missouri. One key change is that people who are 70 years old or older can now request to be excused without needing to provide hardship reasons. The bill also clarifies other reasons why people may be excused, such as recent jury service, health issues, caregiving responsibilities, religious beliefs, or physically or financially extreme hardships. These updates aim to make it clearer who can be excused from jury duty and ensure that exemptions are fairly applied, affecting current and future potential jurors in Missouri.
