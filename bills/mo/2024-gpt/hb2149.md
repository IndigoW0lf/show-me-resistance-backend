summary_short: "This bill sets rules for how ambulance providers are paid for emergency services when they are not in-network with a patient's health plan in Missouri."
summary: |
  This law creates new rules to ensure ambulance providers are paid fairly when providing emergency services, even if they are not contracted with your health insurance. It specifies the minimum reimbursement rates that health insurers must pay to out-of-network ambulance providers, based on local rates or a percentage of Medicare rates. The bill also requires that insurance companies pay these providers directly within 30 days of receiving a clean claim, and prohibits ambulance providers from billing patients for additional charges if covered services are paid. It aims to improve transparency and fairness in payments for emergency ambulance services across Missouri.
