summary: |
  This bill revises the laws in Missouri related to marriage, including the age at which people can marry and the process for obtaining a marriage license. It clarifies that a marriage license must be obtained before the marriage is recognized as valid, and sets new rules for how applications can be completed if a person is unable to sign in person, such as due to military duty or incarceration. The bill includes specific procedures for these individuals to apply for a marriage license remotely, using sworn statements and official identification, ensuring they can still legally marry even if they are temporarily unavailable to appear in person.
