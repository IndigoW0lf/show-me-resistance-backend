summary_short: "This bill allows metropolitan school districts to ask voters for a small sales tax to fund special educational programs."
summary: |
  The bill authorizes metropolitan school districts in Missouri to impose a small sales tax, up to 0.25%, to raise funds specifically for special educational services. Before implementing the tax, the school district must put the question to voters in an election, who will decide whether to approve it. If voters agree, the tax will be collected by the state's revenue department and placed in a dedicated trust fund to support the intended educational programs. Only if most voters approve will the tax start, and the revenue raised is used solely for improving educational services in the district.
