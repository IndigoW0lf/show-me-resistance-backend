summary_short: "This bill restricts what can be taught in public schools about race and history to ensure no one is made to personally affirm ideas that promote discrimination or collective guilt based on race or ethnicity."
summary: |
  This bill, known as SB1181, sets rules for public schools in Missouri regarding discussions of certain sensitive concepts, especially related to race and history. It prevents schools and teachers from forcing students or staff to personally agree with or promote ideas that suggest racial or ethnic groups are inherently superior, inferior, or responsible for past actions. Schools are also prohibited from including materials or instruction that endorse those ideas. However, the bill allows for the discussion of current events, historical topics like specific cultural histories, and research or independent studies, as long as schools clearly state they do not endorse these views. The goal is to promote respectful, non-discriminatory education and prevent the promotion of harmful racial stereotypes.
