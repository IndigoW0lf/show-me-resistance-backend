summary: |
  This bill allows first-time business owners who live in Missouri to open special savings accounts to fund their new businesses. If they contribute money to these accounts, they can receive a tax deduction on their state income taxesâ€”up to 50% of their contributions, with limits based on their income. The money saved in these accounts, along with any earnings, will be exempt from state taxes, making it easier and more affordable for new entrepreneurs to start and grow their businesses. However, if the saved money is withdrawn and not used for business expenses or if the account rules aren't followed, some of the tax benefits may have to be paid back. This program begins in January 2025 and aims to support new business owners in Missouri.
