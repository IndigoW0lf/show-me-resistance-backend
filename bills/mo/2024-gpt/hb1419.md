summary: |
  The Missouri Disabled Veterans Homestead Exemption allows certain veterans with a disability who own and live in a home valued under $250,000 to reduce their property taxes. It also provides this exemption to qualifying surviving spouses of disabled veterans who have died, under specific conditions. The aim is to help disabled veterans and their families by offering tax relief on their primary homes, starting from the year 2024. This benefit is in addition to other existing property tax exemptions and is designed to support those who have served in the military and have a service-connected disability.
