summary_short: "This bill updates workers' compensation laws in Missouri related to injuries caused by workplace accidents, rule violations, and drug or alcohol use."
summary: |
  This bill changes Missouri's workers' compensation rules to clarify how injuries at work are handled. It states that employers must provide compensation for employees hurt by accidents or workplace-related illnesses, regardless of fault, except in cases of intentional injury by the employee. The bill increases benefits if an employer fails to follow safety laws or orders, but reduces benefits if an employee ignores safety rules or causes injuries through drug or alcohol use at work. It also specifies that injuries caused by alcohol or drugs, including marijuana, will lead to a 50% reduction in compensation if the employee's violation contributed to the injury. Overall, the bill aims to address safety, accountability, and the impact of substance use on workplace injuries.
