summary_short: "This bill bans using TANF benefit cards at ATMs for cash and restricts what can be bought with the benefits to prevent purchases at certain places."
summary: |
  The bill changes rules for people receiving temporary assistance for needy families (TANF). It makes it illegal to use TANF benefit cards to get cash at ATMs or to buy items like alcohol, tobacco, lottery tickets, or go to certain adult entertainment or gaming establishments. If someone uses their benefits in these ways, they must pay back the department and could lose their benefits for periods ranging from three months to five years, depending on how many times they do it. The bill also prohibits stores from accepting TANF or SNAP benefits for these restricted purchases and from encouraging or allowing such misuse. This affects TANF recipients, stores accepting benefits, and the Department of Social Services that manages these programs.
