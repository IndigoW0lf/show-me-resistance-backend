summary: |
  HB1726 changes the rules for Missouri cities, counties, school districts, and other local agencies when they borrow money through bonds or notes. It clarifies that these bonds can now be issued in various forms, including book-entry and registered forms, with interest rates up to 14%. The bill also states that bonds should be sold at the best possible price, with certain minimum and maximum interest rates, and it sets new standards for how bonds are soldâ€”either through competitive bidding or negotiated sales if an agency has a high bond rating. Overall, the bill aims to make borrowing easier and more flexible for local governments while ensuring transparency and responsible issuing practices.
