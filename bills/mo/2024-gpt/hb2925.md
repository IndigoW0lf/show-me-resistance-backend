summary: |
  This bill changes the rules for local government entities in Missouri to follow when creating their yearly budgets. It requires most political subdivisions to prepare a detailed annual budget that includes a budget message, expected revenues, planned expenditures, and debt payments. The bill also specifies that the budget must stay within the projected income and available funds. Additionally, it clarifies that a designated budget officer will lead the budget process, and that the budget must be shared with governing body members at least seven days before they vote on it. These changes aim to make budget planning more organized and transparent for the public and local officials.
