summary_short: "This bill officially renames a historic memorial park in Lafayette County, Missouri, dedicated to Confederate soldiers."
summary: |
  The bill repeals the old law that described a specific piece of land in Lafayette County and replaces it with a new law that designates this land as a memorial park. The park is meant to honor the bravery of soldiers who fought for the Confederacy during the Civil War. The land remains under the control of the Missouri Department of Natural Resources and will be officially called "The Confederate Valor of Soldiers Memorial Park." This change affects the management and official naming of the memorial site.
