summary_short: "This law requires individuals convicted of DUI that caused a parent's death to pay child support until certain conditions are met."
summary: |
  This bill, known as "Bentley's Law," states that if someone is convicted of driving while intoxicated (DUI) and that crime resulted in a parent's death, they may be ordered by the court to pay child support to the children until the children reach specific milestones, such as turning 18, getting married, joining the military, or reaching age 21 (or 18 if certain conditions are met). The law also allows for extended support if the children are incapacitated or still in school. It mainly affects people convicted of DUI that caused a parentâ€™s death and the children they leave behind. The goal is to ensure that the children of those affected by serious DUI crimes receive ongoing financial support.
