summary_short: "This bill proposes a constitutional change to ensure that anyone convicted of sexually trafficking a child in the first degree faces life imprisonment without parole."

summary: |
  The bill aims to amend the Missouri Constitution to establish that individuals convicted of first-degree child sexual trafficking will serve life imprisonment without the possibility of probation or parole. This change would be decided by voters in the next general election, allowing the public to approve or reject the new law. If approved, it would mean that offenders convicted of this serious crime will remain in prison for their entire lives, reflecting the state's commitment to protecting children and punishing such offenses severely.
