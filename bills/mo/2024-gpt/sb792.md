summary: |
  This bill, called the "Revitalizing Missouri Downtowns and Main Streets Act," provides tax incentives for property owners who convert old nonresidential buildings into residential, retail, or commercial spaces in downtown districts. If they spend money on eligible renovations, they can receive a tax credit of 25% or 30%, depending on the project. These credits can be used to reduce state taxes over multiple years. The law aims to encourage the redevelopment of historic buildings, boost local economies, and improve downtown areas across Missouri.
