summary_short: "This bill proposes a new constitutional law in Missouri that would make life imprisonment the mandatory punishment for first-degree child sexual trafficking."
summary: |
  The bill aims to change Missouri's constitution to ensure that anyone convicted of first-degree child sexual trafficking faces life in prison without the possibility of parole or probation. It adds a new section to the state's Constitution that clearly states this mandatory sentence, making it a permanent punishment for such offenses. This change is intended to strengthen protections for children and ensure harsher penalties for those involved in severe sexual offenses against minors. The amendment would be voted on by Missouri residents in the 2024 general election or a special election called for this purpose.
