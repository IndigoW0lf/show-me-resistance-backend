summary_short: "This bill sets new rules for transferring firearms, requiring transfers through licensed dealers and background checks."

summary: |
  This bill requires that any sale or transfer of firearms in Missouri be done either through a licensed firearms dealer or under specific conditions. If neither party is a dealer, the transfer must go through a licensed dealer who will handle the paperwork and conduct a criminal background check on the buyer. The law also protects licensed dealers from sharing transaction records and clarifies exceptions for law enforcement and certain officials. These rules aim to make gun transfers safer and better regulated, affecting private individuals, dealers, and law enforcement agencies.
