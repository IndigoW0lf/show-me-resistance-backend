summary_short: "Requires used motor vehicles to be inspected before sale to ensure safety, with some exceptions, and updates related inspection rules."

summary: |
  This bill requires that, before a used motor vehicle is sold, it must undergo a full inspection and obtain a new official certificate of approval, regardless of any existing inspection certificate, with certain exceptions such as vehicles sold for junk, salvage, or rebuild. Sellers must cover the inspection cost, and the certificate must be presented to the buyer at sale. Additionally, vehicles that are part of a regional emissions program need to be inspected and approved before sale, with certain intervals based on the vehicle's model year. This law affects vehicle sellers, buyers, and inspectors, aiming to improve vehicle safety and environmental compliance during transactions.
