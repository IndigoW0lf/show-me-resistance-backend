summary: |
  The bill makes changes to Missouri's workers' compensation laws by updating the definitions of "employee" and "injury." It clarifies that most workers, including minors and certain corporate officers, are covered under workers' compensation. The bill specifies when an injury is considered to have happened "out of and in the course of employment," focusing on injuries caused by specific accidents during work hours. It also explains that injuries caused by natural or pre-existing conditions, like certain diseases or heart attacks, are only covered if work was the main cause. These updates aim to make the rules clearer about who can receive workers' compensation and under what circumstances.
