summary_short: "This bill requires schools to provide free period products and removes rules about sexuality education related to abortion providers."
summary: |
  Starting July 1, 2025, all public middle and high schools, as well as charter schools, must provide free period products like tampons and sanitary napkins in their restrooms. This helps students who menstruate by giving them access to these essential items at no cost. Additionally, the bill repeals certain rules that previously restricted abortion service providers from offering education on human sexuality and sexually transmitted diseases, allowing more open and fact-based instruction. The changes aim to support students' health and well-being while promoting accurate and comprehensive sexuality education.
