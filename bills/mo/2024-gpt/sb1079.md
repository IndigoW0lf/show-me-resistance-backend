summary_short: "This bill changes how school districts must present information about borrowing money through bonds and the impact on property taxes during elections."

summary: |
  The bill updates the language used on election ballots when school districts ask voters to approve or reject bonds for funding projects. It specifies the exact way questions should be asked, including details about how borrowing will affect property taxesâ€”whether it will increase, stay the same, or potentially decrease after bonds are paid off. These clearer questions aim to help voters better understand the financial impact of school district bond proposals before voting. The changes affect school districts, voters, and the way financial information is communicated during bond elections.
