summary: |
  This bill creates a permanent joint committee in Missouri's government made up of members from both the Senate and House of Representatives. The committee will research whether the state can issue gold and silver coins as legal money and whether it should keep some gold and silver in state custody. The goal is to consider whether these metals could be used for paying debts or held as a reserve. The committee will report its findings and suggestions to the full legislature, and all state agencies will be required to cooperate with their efforts.
