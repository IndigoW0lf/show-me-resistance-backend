summary_short: "This bill removes the age limit on health insurance coverage for low protein modified food products for certain medical conditions in Missouri."

summary: |
  This bill, SB1407, updates Missouri law to require health insurance plans to cover special low-protein foods used to treat specific inherited metabolic diseases like phenylketonuria. Previously, coverage was only required for children under six years old. Now, people of any age with these conditions can have their insurance pay for these specialized foods when prescribed by a doctor. The law applies to many types of health insurance plans, such as individual, group, and employer-provided plans, but excludes some supplemental insurance policies like life or accident-only insurance.
