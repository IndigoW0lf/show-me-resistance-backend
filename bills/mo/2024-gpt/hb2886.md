summary_short: "This bill updates how credit unions are examined and rated to improve transparency and community awareness."

summary: |
  This bill changes how credit unions in Missouri are checked and evaluated. It requires the director of the division of credit unions to examine each credit union at least once a year or more often if needed. The bill allows examinations to be replaced with approved audit or federal reports, which can save time and resources. Importantly, it promotes community-focused evaluations by assessing how well credit unions meet the credit and deposit needs of their local communities, including minorities and low-income areas. The results will be shared both privately with the credit unions and publicly, providing clearer information about their performance.
