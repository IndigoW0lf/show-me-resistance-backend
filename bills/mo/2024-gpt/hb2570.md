summary: |
  The bill changes the law governing special road districts in Missouri. It clarifies that these districts can spend up to a certain portion of their revenue on roads within cities, specifically to grade, repair, and build roads that match the existing streets' standards. The spending is limited to a percentage based on the amount of road miles within the cities compared to the entire district, and funds cannot be used outside the district's county. This affects how road district funds are used for road maintenance and development in cities within the districts.
