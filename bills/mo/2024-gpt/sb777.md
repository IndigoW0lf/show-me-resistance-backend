summary: |
  The bill updates Missouri law to exempt certain food items from sales tax, specifically those that can be purchased with food stamps and items sold through vending machines. It also revises the rules for vehicle and other titled item taxes, including updates on tax rates for retail sales of property and services. These changes affect consumers buying food, as well as sellers and buyers of vehicles, boats, trailers, and related items, making the tax system clearer and possibly more favorable for some purchases.
