summary_short: "This bill updates rules about how the Senate handles reports and amendments for bills, especially those involving new spending from the state's main revenue source."
summary: |
  This bill makes changes to Senate Rules 50 and 60 to improve how bills are reported and amended. It specifies that for appropriations bills—those that involve new government spending—each section requiring new funding must be clearly noted and voted on separately. The bill also sets procedures for how bills are considered in committees, including how many senators need to agree to move a bill forward or send it back for further review. Additionally, it ensures that all amendments to bills, especially those involving spending, are properly printed and acknowledged before final approval. These rules aim to make the legislative process more organized, transparent, and fair for all senators and for those affected by the laws.
