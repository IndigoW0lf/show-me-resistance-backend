summary_short: "The bill requires that any substitute bill be shared with all senators at least two days before it is introduced."
summary: |
  This bill amends the rules for how the Senate handles bill substitutions. It states that if a senator wants to introduce a replacement version of a bill (called a substitute), it must be given to all other senators at least two legislative days before it can be offered. This change aims to give senators more time to review proposed substitutions before voting on them, making the process more transparent and allowing for better-informed decision-making. It affects senators and legislative staff involved in bill drafting and debate.
