summary_short: "This bill requires annual school accountability reports that include detailed information about school performance, finances, and student data, aimed at increasing transparency for parents and the public."
summary: |
  The bill mandates the Missouri Department of Elementary and Secondary Education to create and publish detailed accountability report cards for each public school, school district, and charter school every year. These reports will include information such as test scores, graduation rates, attendance, discipline incidents, staff qualifications, financial data, and student demographics. The goal is to make school performance information clear, accessible, and useful for parents, taxpayers, news media, and policymakers. The reports will also identify schools that need improvement, while ensuring that data remains anonymous and respects privacy. This legislation affects schools, school districts, students, parents, and the public by providing more transparent and standardized information about education quality and resources.
