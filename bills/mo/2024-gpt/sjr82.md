summary_short: "This bill would replace the property tax on real estate with a sales tax in Missouri, starting in 2025."
summary: |
  This bill proposes changing how property taxes are collected in Missouri. Instead of paying an annual property tax, property owners would pay a sales tax whenever they transfer ownership of their property. The new sales tax would be equal to the usual property tax rate and paid either immediately or over several years, depending on the choice the owner makes. Owners of previously purchased properties would also pay a similar sales tax based on their remaining mortgage balance. This change aims to shift from traditional property taxes to a sales-based system for taxing real estate.
