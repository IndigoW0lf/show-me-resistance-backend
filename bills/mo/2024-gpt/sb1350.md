summary: |
  This bill requires the state and local government agencies or entities involved in awarding contracts to treat all bidders fairly, without giving special treatment or discrimination based on their ESG scores. ESG scores evaluate factors like environmental impact, social responsibility, and workplace policies. The purpose is to ensure that contract decisions are not influenced by how companies are rated on these ESG factors, affecting contractors, subcontractors, and businesses seeking government contracts.
