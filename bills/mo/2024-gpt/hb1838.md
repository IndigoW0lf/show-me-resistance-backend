summary: |
  This bill repeals the expiration date for funding of basic civil legal services in Missouri, ensuring that funds dedicated to helping low-income individuals with civil legal issues are available indefinitely. It creates a "Basic Civil Legal Services Fund" managed by the Missouri Supreme Court, which receives money from court surcharges and other sources. The funds are used to provide legal assistance to low-income residents, especially families, victims of domestic violence, the elderly, and those needing help to access state benefits. It also specifies how the funds are to be allocated and used, emphasizing transparency and ongoing support without a set end date.
