summary: |
  This bill changes the law about who can be awarded custody of a child. It states that grandparents should be given priority in custody cases if it’s in the child's best interest. The law also clarifies how custody is decided, emphasizing the child's best interests and considering factors like each parent’s ability to care for the child, the child's relationship with family, and the child's overall well-being. It applies to any custody case where a child's future living arrangements are being decided, and it aims to promote stable, meaningful relationships with grandparents when appropriate.
