summary_short: "This bill lets public library districts decide their own fiscal year start and end dates."
summary: |
  This bill allows the board of trustees for consolidated public library districts in Missouri to set their own start and end dates for their fiscal years, instead of sticking to the standard July 1 to June 30 schedule. It also outlines how the library's budget is prepared, approved, and managed each year. The bill specifies how funds are kept, spent, and accounted for, including money from taxes, state aid, and grants. Overall, it gives library districts more flexibility and clear rules for their financial planning and management.
