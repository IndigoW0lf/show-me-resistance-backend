summary_short: "This bill proposes a constitutional change to grant property tax exemptions to certain disabled veterans in Missouri."
summary: |
  The bill aims to amend the Missouri Constitution to provide property tax exemptions for veterans who have a total service-connected disability. Specifically, it exempts their real and personal property from property taxes, including homes used as homesteads. The bill also clarifies rules about existing exemptions for certain types of property used for business, religious, educational, charitable, and veterans' organizations. These changes will affect disabled veterans, property owners, and local governments by reducing tax revenue from the exempted properties and requires future legislation to define how some exempted personal property is treated. The purpose is to honor disabled veterans by making their homes and certain personal property tax-free.
