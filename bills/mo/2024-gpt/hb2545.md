summary_short: "This law requires private schools to disclose any sexual misconduct allegations against former employees to prevent future harm, and they could be held liable if they fail to do so."
summary: |
  This bill applies to private schools that charge tuition and are not part of the public school system in Missouri. If a private school learns about a sexual misconduct allegation involving an employee who worked with children, and later dismisses or allows the employee to resign, they must share this information when asked by future employers or other schools. If the school fails to disclose this information, they could be held responsible for damages if a new employer's student is harmed by that employee's misconduct. The law aims to protect students by ensuring that private schools are transparent about past misconduct of employees.
