summary: |
  This bill replaces an old law with a new one that sets up a special fund in the state's treasury called the "Division of Tourism Supplemental Revenue Fund." This fund collects money from the state, gifts, grants, and other sources to support tourism activities. The money in this fund is used only by the Missouri Department of Economic Development's Division of Tourism to help promote and develop tourism across the state. It also outlines rules on how additional money from sales taxes on tourist goods and services is added to the fund and how those amounts may vary depending on sales tax increases over time.
