summary_short: "This bill creates a program to help students pay for shorter technical training programs at approved institutions in Missouri."
summary: |
  The bill introduces the Career-Tech Certificate (CTC) Program, which provides financial assistance for students attending certain postsecondary schools and training providers in Missouri. It applies to students enrolled in programs that lead to industry-recognized certificates or credentials, especially in areas with occupational shortages. Starting in the 2025-26 academic year, eligible students can receive reimbursements for tuition, books, and fees through a designated fund, making it easier for them to afford short-term career training options. The program is designed to support non-degree certificate programs such as nurse assistant, medication technician, or commercial driverâ€™s license training, and benefits students attending public, private, virtual, or approved training providers.
