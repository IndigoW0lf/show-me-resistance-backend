summary_short: "This bill limits how law enforcement agencies in Missouri can transfer seized property to federal authorities and sets rules for forfeiture procedures."
summary: |
  This bill is designed to make the process of seizing and forfeiting property clearer and more local-focused. It states that state and local law enforcement agencies cannot transfer seized property to federal agencies for federal forfeiture purposes, unless certain conditions are met, such as the seizure involving more than fifty thousand dollars in U.S. currency. If property is seized together with federal authorities in joint task forces, the property generally remains under state control unless the seizure involves large sums of money, in which case federal transfer is possible with proper notice. The bill also ensures that property owners are notified at least 96 hours before any transfer to the federal government and prohibits agencies from accepting certain forfeiture proceeds unless specific criteria are met. This law aims to keep property forfeiture processes transparent and primarily within state jurisdiction, affecting local law enforcement, prosecutors, and property owners.
