summary_short: "Creates a law requiring drunk drivers to pay restitution to children of victims who died, until the child turns 18 or finishes high school."
summary: |
  This bill, called "Bentley and Mason's Law," requires people convicted of driving while intoxicated (DWI) to pay financial support to the children of victims who died because of their actions. The court will determine a fair monthly payment to help support these children until they reach adulthood or complete high school. The payments are made directly to the child's parent, guardian, or the state, and the law outlines procedures for calculating, delivering, and enforcing these restitution payments. This law aims to assist children affected by fatal drunk driving incidents and ensure offenders contribute to their ongoing support.
