summary_short: "This bill proposes an amendment to Missouri's Constitution to set new rules on state spending and property tax assessments, subject to voter approval in 2024."

summary: |
  The bill, known as SJR 53, aims to add a new section to Missouri's Constitution that will establish limits on how much the state can increase its total spending each year. It introduces a formula called the "appropriations growth limit," which depends on inflation and population growth, to prevent excessive increases in state budgets. Additionally, it provides definitions for terms related to property tax assessments and state revenue. If approved by voters in the 2024 election, these new rules will help control state spending and make property tax assessments more transparent.
