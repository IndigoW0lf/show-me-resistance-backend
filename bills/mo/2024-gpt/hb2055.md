summary_short: "This bill makes food sales tax-free in Missouri starting in 2029 and reduces tax on food over four years."
summary: |
  The bill removes the state and local sales tax on most retail sales of food in Missouri, effective January 1, 2029. It begins by reducing the local food sales tax gradually over four years, starting in January 2025, then fully exempts food from sales tax. The law applies only to food eligible for food stamps and vending machine food, but not to prepared food sold for immediate consumption, such as restaurant meals. This change affects consumers by making many grocery and food purchases cheaper and impacts government revenue related to food sales tax.
