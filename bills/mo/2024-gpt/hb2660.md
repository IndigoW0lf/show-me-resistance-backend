summary_short: "This bill adjusts the fines for violations of federal natural gas safety rules in Missouri."
summary: |
  The bill changes the way penalties are set for companies or organizations that own natural gas facilities and violate safety standards required by federal law. Instead of fixed dollar amounts, the maximum fines are now based on the penalties set by the U.S. Secretary of Transportation. It affects gas companies, utilities, and municipalities that own gas plants, making them responsible for safety compliance and possible fines. The bill also explains how fines are determined and makes each violation, or ongoing violations, a separate offense.
