summary_short: "This bill changes the property assessment cycle for residential properties from two years to four years starting in 2027."

summary: |
  The bill updates the way residential real estate is valued for tax purposes. Instead of reassessing properties every two years, assessments for certain residential properties will now occur every four years starting in 2027. This change applies to specific subclasses of residential property and aims to make the reassessment process less frequent, potentially reducing the workload for assessors and providing more stability for property owners. The bill affects property owners, assessors, and local governments involved in property taxation.
