summary_short: "This bill requires state agencies to include a detailed cost-benefit analysis with every proposed and final regulation to ensure benefits outweigh costs."

summary: |
  HB 2579 mandates that all Missouri state agencies must first prepare and include a clear analysis of the expected costs and benefits for each proposed regulation. When final rules are published, agencies must also provide an updated analysis showing any changes and must make all related documents publicly available online. This law aims to increase transparency and accountability by ensuring regulations are justified by a thorough review of their economic impacts, and it allows stakeholders to challenge rules if the analysis is found to be incomplete or misleading.
