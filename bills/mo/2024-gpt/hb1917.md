summary: |
  This bill makes it mandatory for schools in Missouri to conduct hearing screenings for children in kindergarten and first grade beginning with the 2025-26 school year. Schools must notify parents about the screening process before the school year starts and complete the screenings by November 1st. Parents can choose to have the school conduct the screening or obtain a list of nearby providers if they prefer to get it done outside of school. If a screening shows potential hearing problems, the school must do further testing to see if the child needs special educational support. Children who have recently been examined by a doctor can be exempted from the screening with a written notice. The bill aims to catch hearing issues early to support student learning and development.
