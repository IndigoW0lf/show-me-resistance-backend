summary_short: "This resolution urges Congress to bring back mandatory country of origin labels for meat sold in the U.S., helping consumers know where their food comes from."

summary: |
  This bill is a resolution from the Missouri Senate that asks the United States Congress to reinstate strict labeling requirements for meat products. It supports the idea that consumers have the right to know whether meat is raised and processed in the U.S. or imported from other countries. The bill highlights that in 2008, Congress passed a law requiring such labels, but it was repealed in 2015, reducing transparency. It affects farmers, ranchers, meat producers, and consumers by promoting honesty about food origins, which can also impact food safety and national pride. The resolution emphasizes technological advances that make accurate labeling possible and urges Congress to restore these protections.
