summary_short: "Allows people convicted of drug-related felonies in Missouri to become eligible for food assistance benefits after meeting certain conditions."
summary: |
  This bill changes the rules in Missouri so that individuals with a drug-related felony conviction can qualify for the SNAP food assistance program. To be eligible, they must wait at least five years after their conviction, complete any probation or parole, pay all court costs and fines, and not have committed additional crimes. It applies only if they provide proof that these conditions are met. The goal is to help people restart their lives and access food support, provided they follow the legal requirements after their conviction.
