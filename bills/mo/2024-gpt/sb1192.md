summary_short: "This bill creates a grant program to help nonprofit organizations at risk of terrorist attacks improve their security in Missouri."

summary: |
  This law establishes a Missouri Task Force on Safety and Security for Nonprofit Organizations to study and recommend how to support nonprofits that face higher risks of terrorist threats. The task force will suggest ways to fund and administer grants for security measures like security personnel, training, and facility protections. It will also promote outreach and education to nonprofit groups, especially those applying for grants for the first time. The Department of Public Safety will run the grant program based on the task forceâ€™s advice, and annual reports will share the findings and needs of these at-risk nonprofits. This affects nonprofit organizations, faith-based groups, and other community organizations across Missouri that seek to enhance their safety against potential threats.
