summary: |
  This new law in Missouri makes sure that health insurance plans will pay for self-administered hormonal contraceptives, which are medications that women can take themselves to prevent pregnancy. Beginning on January 1, 2025, any health plan that covers contraceptives must also cover these self-administered options and pay providers for supplies that can last up to one year. The law ensures that this coverage wonâ€™t cost more in deductibles or co-payments than other similar health services, making it easier and more affordable for women to access long-term contraception without additional costs.
