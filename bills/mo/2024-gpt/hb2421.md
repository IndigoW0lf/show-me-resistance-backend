summary_short: "This bill changes rules about who is considered a Missouri resident for college tuition and limits public benefits for undocumented immigrants."
summary: |
  This bill updates the laws related to higher education tuition and public benefits. It states that students who graduate from Missouri high schools or home schools will be considered Missouri residents for tuition purposes unless they choose to prove otherwise. It also specifies that undocumented immigrants cannot receive most public benefits, although emergency services and some legal aid are still available. The bill requires applicants for public benefits to prove they are U.S. citizens or legal residents, and it keeps some information about students' residency private. These changes aim to clarify residency status for tuition and restrict public benefits based on immigration status.
