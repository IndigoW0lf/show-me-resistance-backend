summary_short: "This bill creates a voluntary process for individuals to restrict themselves from being able to buy firearms."
summary: |
  This law allows people in Missouri to choose to be added to a list that temporarily or permanently prevents them from purchasing guns. They can submit a request through their local circuit court, which will verify their identity without collecting fingerprints or biometric data. Once on the list, firearm sellers are legally required to check the list before completing a sale, helping individuals restrict their own access if they choose. The goal is to give people more control over firearm purchases and promote responsible gun ownership.
