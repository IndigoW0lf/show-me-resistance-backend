summary_short: "This bill ensures fire protection services continue in annexed areas and sets rules for funding and residents' voting rights."
summary: |
  The bill requires fire protection districts to keep providing fire services in areas that are annexed by a city in certain large counties. The city must pay the fire district an amount equivalent to what the district would have collected through taxes from the annexed area. Residents in the annexed area will still be able to vote in fire district elections and run for its board. This law helps protect fire services and clarifies how funding and voting rights are handled after annexation.
