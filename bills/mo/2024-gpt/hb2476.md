summary_short: "This bill allows trustees of reorganized common sewer districts in Missouri to be paid for their service."
summary: |
  The bill updates the laws in Missouri so that trustees who manage sewer districts can receive payment for their work. It defines how many trustees can be appointed, how they are chosen, and how much they can be paid for attending meetings. This change applies to sewer districts in most counties, except the largest first-class counties that have their own special rules. The goal is to make sure trustees are fairly compensated while managing sewer services, improving transparency and encouraging qualified individuals to serve.
