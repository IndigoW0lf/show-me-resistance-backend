summary_short: "This bill sets rules about non-compete agreements and makes them invalid for hourly workers in Missouri."
summary: |
  This bill changes the rules for agreements where employees promise not to work for competitors after leaving a job. It states that such agreements, known as covenants not to compete, are not enforceable if the employee is paid hourly wages. The goal is to protect hourly workers from restrictions that could limit their employment opportunities after they leave a job. Employers can still include these agreements, but they won't be enforceable for hourly workers under this law.
