summary: |
  This legislation allows eligible employers in Missouri to receive a tax credit of up to $1,000 for each state-owned vehicle they purchase and use to help employees on probation or parole get to and from work. To qualify, the employee must have a felony conviction, be on probation or parole, have completed a certain training program, and have worked full-time for at least 12 months. The employer must keep records like purchase receipts and use logs to prove the vehicle is used for this purpose. The goal is to support the employment and transportation needs of individuals who are working to re-enter society after incarceration.
