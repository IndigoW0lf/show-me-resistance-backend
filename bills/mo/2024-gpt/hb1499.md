summary_short: "Requires a safety inspection every time a used vehicle is sold in Missouri, regardless of its age or mileage."

summary: |
  This bill mandates that whenever a used vehicle is sold in Missouri, it must undergo a safety inspection, no matter how old or how many miles it has. Previously, inspections were only required for certain vehicles based on age, mileage, or type. Now, sellers and buyers will need to ensure the vehicle passes a safety check each time ownership changes hands. This aims to improve road safety for all drivers and passengers by ensuring vehicles are inspected more frequently during sales transactions.
