summary_short: "This bill updates the rules for reporting and investigating missing persons in Missouri to improve tracking and response times."

summary: |
  The bill revises Missouri laws about how missing persons are reported and managed. It requires law enforcement, families, or guardians to quickly file detailed reports when someone goes missing, especially children. These reports must be entered immediately into national and state databases to help locate the person faster. Once the missing person is found or confirmed safe, agencies must remove their information from these systems. The bill also mandates that law enforcement keep missing child cases active until the child is found. Overall, these changes aim to make the process of finding missing persons more efficient and thorough, benefiting families, law enforcement, and the community.
