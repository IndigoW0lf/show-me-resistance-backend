summary_short: "This bill makes it illegal for school employees to provide explicit sexual material to students and removes funding from entities that do so."
summary: |
  The bill clarifies that any school staff member who knowingly provides or distributes explicit sexual material to students will be committing a misdemeanor offense. It defines what counts as explicit sexual material and who is considered a school employee. Additionally, if a school or library employs someone guilty of this offense, that school or library will lose eligibility for state funding. This aims to prevent inappropriate content from being shared with students and hold schools and staff accountable.
