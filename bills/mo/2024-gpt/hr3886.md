summary_short: "This is a formal notice that the House of Representatives is in session and ready to do its work."
summary: |
  This bill is a resolution that officially informs the Senate that the House of Representatives has started its legislative session and is prepared to consider and pass laws. It doesn't make any new laws itself but serves as a formal announcement of the House's current operating status. This affects members of the Senate and House by confirming that legislative business can begin or continue. It's an important procedural step to ensure smooth communication between the two chambers of government.
