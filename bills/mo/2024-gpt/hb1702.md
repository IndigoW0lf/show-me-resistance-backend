summary_short: "The Driver's Protection Act limits police stops and inspections to reduce unnecessary traffic stops for minor violations."

summary: |
  This bill, called the Driver's Protection Act, makes it so police cannot stop, inspect, or detain drivers just for minor traffic violations unless there has been an accident or injury, the violation involves a commercial vehicle, or points are put on the driverâ€™s record. Basically, if you're just speeding slightly or not registering your vehicle properly, you won't be stopped solely for that reason. The law aims to protect drivers from unnecessary stops and improve road fairness. It mostly affects regular drivers who might otherwise be stopped for minor issues, allowing law enforcement to focus on more serious traffic problems.
