summary_short: "This bill allows high school athletes in Missouri to earn compensation from their name, image, or athletic reputation after signing a college commitment, without losing high school eligibility."
summary: |
  The bill changes the rules for Missouri high school athletes by allowing them to make money from their own reputation, such as through endorsements or marketing, once they have committed to a college. However, they cannot discuss or earn such compensation before signing a college letter of intent or agreement. The bill ensures that earning money this way doesn't affect their eligibility to participate in high school sports. It also clarifies that athletes can include certain school identifiers, like logos or mascots, in their promotional efforts with school approval. These rules mainly impact high school athletes, their schools, and the organizations that support college sports marketing.
