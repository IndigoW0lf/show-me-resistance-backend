summary: |
  Starting January 1, 2005, anyone born after January 1, 1984, who operates a vessel on Missouri waters must have a boating safety identification card. To get this card, individuals need to complete a certified boating safety course, pass an equivalency exam, or hold a valid U.S. Coast Guard license. The card is issued by the water patrol division and lasts for life unless invalidated. Some exemptions apply, such as licensed mariners, visitors staying less than 60 days, and active military personnel. The bill aims to promote safe boating practices and ensures boat operators are knowledgeable about safety laws and procedures.
