summary: |
  This bill changes existing laws about alcohol production and distribution in Missouri. It allows people who make alcohol at home, such as home brewers, wine makers, and distillers, to produce up to 100 gallons of intoxicating liquor per year for personal or family use without needing a license. It also permits these home producers to share or take their alcohol to events or tastings. Additionally, the bill introduces a new system that lets licensed wineries and distilleries ship up to two cases of wine or spirits each month directly to residents in Missouri for their personal use, as long as they do not sell or resell the alcohol. These changes make it easier for residents to legally produce and receive small quantities of alcohol from licensed producers.
