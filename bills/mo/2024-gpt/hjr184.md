summary_short: "This bill proposes changes to how residential property taxes are assessed in Missouri, including limits on annual increases and rules for reassessment."
summary: |
  The bill aims to modify the rules for valuing residential properties for tax purposes in Missouri. Starting in 2025, the assessed value of a home can only increase by up to 4% each year unless certain conditions cause a higher increase, such as a change in ownership or significant improvements like new construction. These rules are designed to make property tax increases more predictable and limit large jumps in property assessments. The bill also defines classifications of property, like residential, agricultural, and commercial, and sets rules for how they are assessed for taxes.
