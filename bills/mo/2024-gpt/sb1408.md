  This bill revises existing laws to make sure gas, electricity, water, and sewer companies provide safe and reliable service at fair and reasonable prices. It prohibits these companies from charging different customers more or less than others for similar services, unless approved by the Public Service Commission. The bill also prevents companies from giving undue advantages to certain customers or locations and allows for automatic rate adjustments through approved sliding scales.

Overall, the bill aims to promote fairness and transparency in utility services for all customers.
