summary_short: "This bill updates laws about tampering with electronic monitoring devices used in criminal cases, making it a serious crime to interfere with them."
summary: |
  This law changes how Missouri handles cases where someone tampers with electronic monitoring equipment, like ankle bracelets, that they are required to wear by the court or parole officials. It clarifies that intentionally damaging, removing, or disabling such equipment is a crime, with penalties depending on the situation. If someone disables or fails to charge the device, it is considered a serious offense that can be classified as a felony, implying it could lead to imprisonment. The law also states that normal maintenance by the owner or their agents is not illegal. This regulation primarily affects individuals on probation or parole who are monitored electronically and aims to ensure compliance with court conditions.
