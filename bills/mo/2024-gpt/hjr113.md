summary_short: "This bill changes the rules for how Missouri voters approve constitutional amendments, making the process clearer and more straightforward."

summary: |
  This bill updates Missouri's procedures for passing constitutional amendments. It requires amendments to be submitted to voters on a separate ballot at the next general or special election, without party labels, and limits each amendment to one subject. It also specifies that only Missouri residents who are U.S. citizens can vote on these amendments. Additionally, amendments proposed by a convention must be approved by a majority of voters statewide and in most congressional districts before they take effect. These changes aim to make the process more transparent and easier for voters to understand and participate in.
