summary: |
  This bill, known as SB940, makes it mandatory for the Missouri Department of Transportation to post important information about highway construction, maintenance, or repairs. Specifically, when the department invites bids for a project, it must publicly share its estimated cost and the expected date for completing the work. This information will be available on their official website so that contractors and the public can see what is planned before contracts are awarded. The goal is to increase transparency and allow all parties to better understand the scope and timeline of highway projects.
