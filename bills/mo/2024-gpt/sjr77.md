summary_short: "This bill changes the rules for using initiative petitions in Missouri, including restrictions on foreign funding and taxes on food or property."
summary: |
  The bill proposes a constitutional amendment that limits how initiative petitions can be used in Missouri. It bans foreign governments and political parties from sponsoring or funding initiatives, making donations, or contributing money related to initiative campaigns. It also restricts the use of initiative petitions to create new revenue, raise sales taxes on food, or impose taxes or fees on real estate and property. Additionally, it outlines how constitutional amendments proposed through initiatives must be approved by voters in a majority of both the state and congressional districts. These changes aim to make the initiative process more transparent and limit foreign influence.
