summary: |
  This bill, HJR95, is a proposed constitutional change that would allow Missouri to give property tax exemptions to certain disabled veterans and define which types of property can be tax-exempt. It would make property owned by qualifying former prisoners of war with service-connected disabilities completely tax-free. The bill also clarifies that various types of personal property, like inventory held by businesses, and property used for religious, charitable, educational, or veterans' purposes, could be exempt from taxes. Additionally, it sets up a system for replacing the revenue lost from certain exemptions, mainly by imposing a countywide tax on specific business inventory, ensuring local governments still have funding. This change would require voter approval in a future election and would impact property owners, veterans, religious, educational, and charitable organizations, as well as local governments.
