summary: |
  This bill, known as the Missouri Childhood Hero Act, sets rules for school districts to prevent and address bullying. It prohibits the use of zero-tolerance disciplinary policies that would suspend, expel, or otherwise discipline students who are victims of bullying or who intervene to help victims. The bill also requires schools to develop model policies, provide training for staff and volunteers on how to protect students and handle incidents, and regularly educate students about bullying and the districtâ€™s anti-bullying rules. These measures aim to create a safer and more supportive environment for students affected by bullying and violence.
