summary: |
  This bill changes the laws in Missouri to allow advanced practice registered nurses (APRNs) to have greater authority to prescribe and administer certain medications. It establishes clear rules for written agreements between doctors and nurses, where nurses can now prescribe specific controlled substances, including some opioids, within set limits. The law also allows APRNs working in hospice care and those providing treatment for substance use disorders to prescribe certain medications. Overall, these changes aim to increase nurses' ability to provide healthcare services, especially in areas where doctors may be scarce, while still requiring collaboration with licensed physicians.
