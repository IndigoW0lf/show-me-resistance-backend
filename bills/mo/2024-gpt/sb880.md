summary_short: "This bill adjusts how property tax credits are given to seniors in Missouri."

summary: |
  This bill changes the rules for giving property tax relief to seniors who own and live in their homes. It allows counties in Missouri to offer a property tax credit to eligible seniors aged 62 or older, reducing their property tax bills based on how much their taxes increase since they became eligible. Counties can choose to provide this credit either through an adoption of an ordinance or by holding a vote among residents. This helps seniors save money on their property taxes and makes it easier for counties to offer support to older homeowners.
