summary: |
  This bill clarifies the legal responsibilities and risks associated with motorized off-road vehicle activities like riding, racing, or demonstrating these vehicles.

The law aims to specify that participants and organizers generally assume the risk of injury and are responsible for their own safety, which could influence liability issues. It affects event organizers, ride participants, spectators (unless they are in unauthorized areas), and anyone involved in off-road vehicle activities at various facilities across the state.
