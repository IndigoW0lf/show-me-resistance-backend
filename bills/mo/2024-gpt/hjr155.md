summary_short: "Proposes a state constitutional change to affirm and clarify gun rights and allow local regulation through ordinances."
summary: |
  This bill suggests amending Missouri’s constitution to better protect the right to keep and bear arms. It states that citizens’ gun rights are unalienable and ensures the state must defend these rights against infringement. It also allows cities and counties like Kansas City and St. Louis to create their own laws for regulating firearms, including setting permit fees and penalties, while respecting the rights of law enforcement, judges, military members, and security personnel. The proposed changes will be decided by voters in the November 2024 election.
