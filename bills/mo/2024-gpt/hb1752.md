summary: |
  This bill changes the rules for building large electrical transmission lines in Missouri. It says that electrical companies must get approval from the state Public Service Commission before starting work on lines that can carry more than 230 kilovolts of electricity. Additionally, the bill requires that the state legislature must approve any construction of such high-voltage lines before companies can begin building. This aims to increase oversight and ensure that the construction of major electrical infrastructure is properly reviewed for public benefits and safety.
