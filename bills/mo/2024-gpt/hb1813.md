summary: |
  This bill establishes the Missouri Broadband Development Council, which will help coordinate efforts to expand high-quality internet access across the state. It defines what qualifies as broadband service and sets clear standards for its speed and capacity. The council will include government officials and public members, including broadband users from different regions, to guide decisions and support broadband growthâ€”especially in areas that currently lack access. It also requires the council to stay updated on federal broadband speed guidelines and promote digital literacy and navigation services. The goal is to improve internet connectivity for all Missourians, particularly in underserved communities.
