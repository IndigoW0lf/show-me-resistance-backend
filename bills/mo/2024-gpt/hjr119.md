summary_short: "This bill updates the rules for citizens proposing constitutional amendments through initiative petitions in Missouri."
summary: |
  The bill changes how initiative petitions for amending the Missouri Constitution are handled. It requires that such petitions be signed by a specific percentage of voters in at least two-thirds of the congressional districts. It also introduces a review and comment process for voters to discuss proposed amendments before they appear on the ballot. Additionally, it clarifies voting thresholds for approving constitutional measures and ensures that the governor's veto power does not apply to measures referred directly to the voters. These changes aim to make the process more transparent, fair, and accessible for Missouri residents involved in shaping their state's constitution.
