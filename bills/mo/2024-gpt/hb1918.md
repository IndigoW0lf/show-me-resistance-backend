  This bill changes Missouriâ€™s health care rules to ensure that people who qualify for MO HealthNet, the state's health coverage program, can get coverage for hearing aids and cochlear implants. It clarifies how payments will be made for different types of medical services, including hospital stays and nursing home care. The aim is to make hearing-related devices more accessible to those in need, especially for children and adults who meet eligibility criteria. This affects low-income residents who rely on MO HealthNet for their health care needs.
