summary: |
  This bill changes the existing law about government transparency in Missouri. It clarifies when government bodies can keep meetings, records, and votes private, such as in legal cases, real estate deals, employee issues, and health or education records. For example, legal case details become public once a case is finalized, and votes on employment decisions are made available within three days. The bill aims to balance privacy with the publicâ€™s right to know about government actions, affecting government agencies, employees, and the public interested in government transparency.
