summary_short: "This bill clarifies rules for health care sharing ministries and prevents them from being considered insurance."

summary: |
  This bill changes the law to specify that health care sharing ministries—faith-based nonprofit groups where members share medical costs—are not considered insurance companies. It sets requirements for these groups to ensure transparency, such as providing clear statements to members that participation is voluntary and not insurance. The bill requires these ministries to register with the state department every June and December if they operate in Missouri. It affects members who choose to join these ministries and aims to ensure they understand the voluntary nature of sharing medical expenses without the protections that come with insurance.
