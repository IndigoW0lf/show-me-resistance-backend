summary: |
  This bill changes existing rules about child workers in Missouri. It says that children under 18 no longer need work certificates or entertainment permits from the government to be employed. Employers also won't be required to get these permits for child workers. The bill requires that children aged 14 to 15 have a parent or guardian approve their work with a permission form. For children working in entertainment, a parent or guardian must always be present at the work location. These updates aim to simplify employment rules for minors and ensure proper supervision, especially in entertainment jobs.
