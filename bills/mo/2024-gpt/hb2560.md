summary_short: "This bill lets electricity customers switch between different rate plans and get past billing savings credited to their accounts."

summary: |
  The bill allows customers of electrical companies who are on time-of-use rate plans to change their plans at any time. When they switch, they can have the savings or extra charges from the previous six months adjusted on their bill. If the overcharge is more than 20%, the credit will only cover the last 90 days. The bill also requires companies to show the cost breakdown for each plan on bills and to default to the least expensive plan if the customer doesn't choose a new one. This makes it easier for customers to choose the best plan for their needs and saves them money.
