summary: |
  This bill requires Missouri school districts to buy or lease only zero-emission (electric or similar clean energy) school buses when they purchase or rent new buses after January 1, 2035. It aims to reduce pollution and promote cleaner transportation for students. If a district finds that zero-emission buses can't work on certain routes or terrains, they can request a five-year extension to meet this requirement. The law affects school transportation providers, school districts, and students by encouraging cleaner, more sustainable school bus options.
