summary: |
  The bill updates Missouri's laws on benevolent tax credits, which help businesses and financial institutions receive tax reductions for their contributions to community programs. It specifies the order in which the tax credits can be applied across different taxes and adjusts the maximum percentage of credits to 70% of contributions, with some limits on total annual credits. The bill also sets caps on the total dollar amount of these tax credits for each fiscal year and defines eligibility criteria for communities, especially smaller towns and rural areas, to benefit from these credits. It affects businesses, financial institutions, and community organizations that participate in qualifying programs, providing incentives for supporting local communities.
