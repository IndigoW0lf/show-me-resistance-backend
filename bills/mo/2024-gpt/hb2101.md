summary_short: "This bill updates the tax credit available for donations to child advocacy groups in Missouri, increasing the amount and removing some limits."
summary: |
  This bill changes Missouri's laws about a special tax credit called the "Champion for Children" credit. It encourages donations to organizations that support children, like court-appointed advocacy groups, child assessment centers, and crisis care centers. Starting from tax years after January 1, 2013, the bill increases the maximum tax credit from 50% to 70% of a donation, with a minimum of $50. It also raises the total amount of tax credits that can be claimed each year, and after July 1, 2024, there is no longer a limit on the total amount of credits that can be redeemed. This law helps incentivize charitable donations to support vulnerable children and families in Missouri.
