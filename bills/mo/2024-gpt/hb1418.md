summary_short: "This bill makes most food sales tax-exempt in Missouri starting January 1, 2025, with a temporary 1% tax on food from October 1997 to December 2024 that funds schools."

summary: |
  This bill changes Missouri laws to remove sales tax from most retail sales of food starting January 1, 2025. Currently, there is a 1% sales tax on food, which helps fund school districts, but the bill states that after December 31, 2024, no sales or use tax will be collected on food sales at all. During the period from October 1, 1997, to December 31, 2024, a 1% tax is still in place for food sales, with the revenue going to support schools. The bill also defines which products count as "food" — specifically those eligible for federal food benefits — and excludes prepared foods sold by restaurants or similar establishments where most sales are for immediate consumption. This change impacts consumers by reducing the overall cost of food and affects sellers and government tax revenue sources.
