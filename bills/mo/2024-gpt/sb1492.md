summary_short: "This bill updates the law about providing explicit sexual material to students, making it a serious crime for school-affiliated staff to do so."
summary: |
  The bill modifies the existing law to make it clear that if someone working with or for a school (like teachers, administrators, or school staff) knowingly gives or supplies explicit sexual material to a student, they commit a serious crime called a Class E felony. It defines what counts as explicit sexual material and who is considered school staff. The law aims to better protect students from inappropriate material by increasing the penalties for those who provide or distribute such content in school settings.
