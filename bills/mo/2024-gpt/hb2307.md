summary: |
  This bill changes the rules for some childrenâ€™s homes and care facilities in Missouri. Instead of needing a standard license, these facilities can register with a well-established, reputable association that sets safety and care standards. To do this, they must submit annual reports about the children they care for, staff, and safety compliance. If they meet all requirements, they receive a two-year registration certificate. The law aims to improve child protection, safety, and transparency, making it easier for eligible facilities to operate legally while still following important rules to keep children safe.
