summary_short: "This law prevents Missouri public agencies from entering into contracts with companies engaged in certain economic boycotts, unless the contract is under $100,000 or involves fewer than 10 employees."

summary: |
  This bill prohibits public entities in Missouri, such as state agencies and local governments, from signing contracts with companies if those companies are involved in economic boycotts. An economic boycott, as defined by the bill, includes refusing to deal with or penalizing companies over issues like fossil fuels, firearms, environmental standards, corporate policies on social issues, or certain business practices. The law requires that contracts include a written certification stating the company is not engaged in, and will not engage in, such boycotts during the contract period. Contracts under $100,000 or with companies that have fewer than ten employees are exempt. The bill aims to promote business dealings that align with state policies and values, affecting companies that do business with Missouri public agencies.
