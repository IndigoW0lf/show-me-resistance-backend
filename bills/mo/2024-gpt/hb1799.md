summary_short: "Limits how much land public agencies can own in counties, requiring local approval for more acquisitions."
summary: |
  This bill sets a rule for counties in Missouri with a certain classification. If at least 20% of the land in such a county is already owned by the federal government, the state, the county, or local governments, then these government entities are restricted from buying or accepting additional land unless the county's local government approves it with a simple majority vote. This means that in some counties, public agencies will need permission from local officials before they can expand their land holdings. The goal is to keep a check on public land ownership and ensure local communities have a say in future land acquisitions.
