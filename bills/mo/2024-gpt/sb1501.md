summary_short: "This bill requires websites to be transparent about collecting and sharing your personal information and gives you rights to control it."

summary: |
  This law sets new rules for websites that collect personal information from consumers. It requires these websites to tell users what types of personal data they collect, why they collect it, and how long they will keep it before doing anything with the data. Users will have the right to request that their personal information be deleted or that it not be sold or shared with others. Websites must provide easy ways for users to make these requests, and if they sell data without permission, they may have to pay the consumer. The bill aims to give people more control over their personal information and improve privacy protections online.
