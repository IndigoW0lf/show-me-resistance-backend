summary_short: "This bill simplifies the process for parents to officially declare their children are homeschooled in Missouri."

summary: |
  The bill allows parents or guardians who choose to homeschool their children to submit a written declaration of enrollment to the local records office or school district within thirty days of starting homeschooling. This declaration must include details such as the child's name and age, the address and phone number of the home school, the names of anyone teaching the children, and the signatures of the responsible adults. Submitting this declaration helps reduce unnecessary investigations into truancy reports and does not count as a violation of truancy laws. The process is designed to make homeschooling more straightforward for families and to clarify their legal status for the education system.
