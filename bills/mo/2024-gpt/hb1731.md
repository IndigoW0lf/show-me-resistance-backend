summary: |
  This bill allows residents of Missouri who make donations to certain local hospital foundations to receive a tax credit on their state income taxes. The total credit amount can be up to $2,500 per person per year and the overall annual limit for everyone is $2 million. To qualify, donors must give to foundations that help pay unpaid hospital bills for patients in need, especially in nonprofit hospitals. This initiative encourages charitable donations to local hospitals by offering a financial benefit on tax returns, but the credit cannot be refunded or sold and can be carried forward for up to three years.
