summary: |
  This bill mandates that most employers in Missouri must provide employees with at least a 30-minute meal break during an 8-hour workday. Employees cannot be kept at their job site for more than five and a half hours without a meal break, but there are some exceptions, such as jobs covered by collective bargaining agreements, small businesses with fewer than five employees per shift, or roles where continuous operations are essential. Employers do not have to pay workers during meal breaks unless they are required to work or are recalled during that time. If an employer violates these rules, they can face fines starting at $300, which can increase for repeated violations. The bill aims to improve working conditions and ensure employees have designated time to eat or rest during their shifts.
