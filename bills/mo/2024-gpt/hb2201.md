summary_short: "This bill allows people on probation or parole for a felony to vote in elections in Missouri."

summary: |
  The bill changes the rules about voting for people who have been convicted of a felony. It allows individuals on probation or parole after a felony conviction to register and vote, which they could not do before. The law still prevents people who are currently in prison or who have been fully convicted of certain offenses from voting. The goal is to give more people in this group the chance to participate in elections and have their voices heard.
