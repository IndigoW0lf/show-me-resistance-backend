summary: |
  SB1372 introduces new rules that prevent illegal immigrants from enrolling in public colleges and universities in Missouri unless they can prove they are U.S. citizens, lawful permanent residents, or legally present in the country. Schools will need to verify studentsâ€™ legal status before enrollment using specific documents. Additionally, the bill stops the state from providing public benefits such as grants or assistance to people who are unlawfully present in the U.S., with only certain emergency and legal services exceptions. The law aims to restrict access for illegal immigrants in education and public assistance programs within Missouri.
