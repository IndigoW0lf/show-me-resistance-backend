summary: |
  This bill repeals and replaces existing laws to clarify and expand the types of income that are not taxed under local earnings tax rules. It lists various organizations and organizations' income that are exempt from taxation, including religious, charitable, educational groups, mutual insurance companies, fraternal societies, and certain federal related entities. The aim is to specify which income sources, such as income from certain associations or organizations, do not have to be taxed, providing clearer rules for these groups. This change affects organizations and individuals in Missouri by potentially reducing their tax obligations and making the rules more straightforward.
