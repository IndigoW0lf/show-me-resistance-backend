summary: |
  This bill updates Missouri law regarding private probation services. It states that private probation providers cannot require drug or alcohol tests unless the offense involved alcohol or drugs or the judge orders it for good reasons. The bill also requires these providers to use a system of earned compliance credits, which can help individuals meet their probation requirements more fairly. Overall, it aims to make probation supervision clearer and fairer for those under supervision, especially on the misdemeanor level. It affects private companies contracted to supervise probationers and the courts that oversee them.
