summary_short: "This bill gives crime victims the right to file a civil lawsuit within the same time limit as the criminal case."
summary: |
  This legislation amends the Missouri Constitution to enhance the rights of crime victims. It ensures that victims can be present at court proceedings, be informed and heard in key hearings, and receive restitution. Importantly, it allows crime victims to bring a civil lawsuit against the defendant or others who caused their injury, with the same time limits as criminal cases. This means victims can seek compensation through civil court without the risk of losing the opportunity due to the passage of time, just like the criminal case process. The bill aims to strengthen victims' protections and ability to seek justice, affecting crime victims, their families, and the criminal justice system.
