summary: |
  This bill, called the Firearm Violence Prevention Act, introduces new laws to help reduce gun-related violence in Missouri. It allows law enforcement to obtain search warrants to seize firearms when there is a risk that a person may be in possession of guns under an extreme risk protection order. The law also clarifies the process for issuing warrants to search for weapons, rescue kidnapped people, or find individuals with outstanding felony warrants. It applies to people who are deemed to be at high risk of harming themselves or others, especially in cases involving family or household members. The goal is to improve safety and give authorities more tools to prevent gun violence and related harm.
