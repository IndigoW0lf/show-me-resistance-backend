summary_short: "This bill creates rules for tracking and sharing information about informants in criminal cases to promote transparency and fairness."
summary: |
  This law establishes new procedures for handling informants in criminal cases. It requires prosecutors to keep a detailed, central record of cases involving informants, including the testimony they provide and any benefits offered to them. Prosecutors must submit this information monthly to a statewide database accessible to other prosecutors. Additionally, when an informant is endorsed to testify, prosecutors must disclose their criminal history and details of any deals or promises made to them within two weeks. These measures aim to make the use of informants more transparent and ensure fair handling of criminal cases.
