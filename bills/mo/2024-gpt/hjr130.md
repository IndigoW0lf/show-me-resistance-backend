summary_short: "This bill proposes a constitutional change to limit how the legislature can alter laws approved by voters."

summary: |
  This bill suggests amending the Missouri Constitution to make it harder for the state legislature to change or repeal laws that voters have approved through initiatives. Under the proposed rules, once a law is approved by voters, the legislature can only amend or revoke it after six years, with a supermajority (three-fourths) approval in both chambers, or if the changes are approved by voters at the next election. This would give more stability and protection to laws directly adopted by the people and limit how quickly or easily the legislature can undo voter-approved measures.
