summary_short: "This bill updates rules for permits related to solid waste disposal facilities in Missouri."

summary: |
  The bill changes the laws about how companies and individuals must get permits to build and operate facilities that process or dispose of solid waste, like landfills. It requires anyone wanting to build or run such facilities to first get approval from the Missouri Department of Natural Resources. The law also adds new steps for public involvement, including notifying local communities and holding public awareness sessions when new disposal sites are proposed, especially for projects requested after August 28, 1999. These rules aim to ensure safety, transparency, and community input when managing waste disposal facilities.
