summary: |
  This bill establishes the Christian Taylor Ferguson (CTF) Medical Alert System in Missouri, designed to quickly find and help missing individuals who are in danger due to medical conditions. The system involves cooperation between the Department of Public Safety, law enforcement, broadcasters, and other agencies to share urgent information about these persons. Participation is voluntary for law enforcement and media partners, and making false alerts is a crime. The goal is to improve the safety and recovery of vulnerable missing persons across the state.
