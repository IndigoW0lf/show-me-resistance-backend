summary_short: "This bill updates how Missouri checks and enforces vehicle insurance laws using new technology and programs."
summary: |
  This bill creates a new program within the Missouri Department of Revenue to improve enforcement of vehicle insurance requirements. It allows the department to work with third-party vendors and use technology, like cameras and sensors, to identify drivers who donâ€™t have the proper insurance. The bill also makes it possible for law enforcement agencies to use technology for investigating and enforcing these laws, and to process violations more efficiently. It aims to encourage people to stay insured by offering options like pretrial diversion, reducing fines, and ensuring that violations are properly recorded and acted upon. The changes mainly affect drivers, insurance companies, and law enforcement agencies by enhancing how vehicle insurance compliance is monitored and enforced.
