summary_short: "This bill prevents cities and towns in Missouri from stopping eviction proceedings unless allowed by state law."

summary: |
  The bill, HB1455, establishes that local governments such as cities, towns, and villages in Missouri cannot impose or enforce a temporary pause on eviction cases unless the state specifically authorizes it. This means that eviction proceedings will continue normally unless the state law provides a special exception. The purpose is to ensure uniform rules across the state, preventing local governments from independently creating eviction bans that are not approved by the state government.
