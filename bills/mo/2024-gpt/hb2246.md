summary_short: "This bill allows certain counties in Missouri to hold an election to impose a hotel guest tax to support law enforcement and tourism."
summary: |
  The bill gives certain small counties in Missouri the authority to ask voters whether they want to add a tax of up to 5% on hotel rooms. If voters approve, the money collected from this tax will be split: half will go to support law enforcement, and the other half will promote tourism. This tax can only be implemented if voters in the county agree through a public election. The purpose of the tax is to help improve safety and boost tourism activities in those counties.
