summary_short: "This bill updates the rules for how self-storage facility owners can sell stored property if tenants don't pay their rent."
summary: |
  This bill changes the laws about what self-storage facility operators can do when tenants do not pay for their stored items. It requires storage operators to clearly inform tenants about their right to have stored property sold if rent or other charges are unpaid. The bill details how and when the operator can sell the property, including giving proper notice at least 45 days in advance. The sale must be done fairly, and any money left after paying the owed charges will be kept for the tenant for one year before being turned over to the state. These rules aim to protect tenants while allowing storage operators to recover unpaid rent through property sales.
