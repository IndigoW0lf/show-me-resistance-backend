summary: |
  The bill establishes the "Motivational Boot Camp Incarceration Program" in Missouri's Department of Corrections. It is designed for young adults aged 17 to 21 who have committed nonviolent crimes and have at least two prior nonviolent convictions. Eligible inmates may be sentenced to this program instead of jail or prison after a third nonviolent offense. The program lasts two years and emphasizes physical fitness, discipline, and counseling to help inmates develop better behavior and self-motivation. The Department of Corrections will set the rules for running this program.
