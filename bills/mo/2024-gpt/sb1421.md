summary: |
  This bill changes the way certain public school employees in Missouri receive cost of living adjustments (COLAs) to their retirement benefits. It updates the rules on how much their retirement allowances can increase based on their years of service and age. The changes mainly affect members of the Public School Retirement System and the Public Education Employee Retirement System, making the COLA calculations clearer and potentially limiting the size of increases. These modifications help ensure the retirement benefits are sustainable while providing fair adjustments for eligible members.
