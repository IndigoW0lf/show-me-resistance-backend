summary_short: "Utilities are required to compensate customers and local governments for damages caused by extended power outages or surges."
summary: |
  This bill requires electric utility companies in Missouri to pay customers and local governments for damages when there are long power outages or power surges. If more than 0.8% of customers experience a power outage lasting four or more hours that lowers voltage or causes a total loss of power, the utility must reimburse affected customers for their actual damages, like spoiled food. The utility must also cover emergency costs for local government agencies dealing with the outage. However, if the outage was caused by weather, customer tampering, unrest, animals, or damage from third parties, the utility can ask for a waiver and may not have to pay. The law clarifies that damages are limited to actual losses, not consequential damages, and cannot be passed to ratepayers. Customers and local governments can only seek these damages through the public service commission, and the utility's liability is limited while a waiver request is pending.
