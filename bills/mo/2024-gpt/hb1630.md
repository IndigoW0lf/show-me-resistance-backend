summary: |
  This bill changes the rules for how circuit clerks are paid in Missouri. It sets specific base salaries depending on the county classification or city where they work, with a higher salary for clerks in St. Louis. The bill also adjusts salaries annually based on judicial salary increases and ensures clerks' pay stays linked to the salaries of associate circuit judges in noncharter counties. Additionally, it introduces a small fee for child support payments made through some clerks in Marion County and makes clear that the state will pay most clerks, except for some cities and counties where their pay is still managed locally. These changes aim to standardize and adjust clerksâ€™ salaries, promote transparency, and ensure fair compensation across different areas.
