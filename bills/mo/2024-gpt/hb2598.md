summary: |
  The bill, HB2598, changes the definition of "special victim" in Missouri law to include school staff members such as teachers, staff, and volunteers who are assaulted while performing their official duties. Previously, the law listed certain groups like law enforcement and emergency workers, but now it expands to better protect school workers. This means that if a school employee or volunteer is attacked while on the job, they will receive additional legal protections and considerations. The bill aims to support and safeguard those working in schools and volunteer roles from violence.
