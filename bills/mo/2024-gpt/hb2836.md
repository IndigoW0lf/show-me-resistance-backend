summary: |
  This bill changes the laws in Missouri regarding taxes paid by hotel guests. It states that counties which have authority to manage convention and sports facilities can add an extra tax between 2% and 5% on hotel room charges. However, before collecting this tax, the county must ask voters in a local election for permission. If voters approve, the tax money will be used exclusively for building, operating, or maintaining convention centers, sports facilities, and related infrastructure. The bill also outlines how the county can collect and manage this tax, either through county officials, an agreement with the facility authority, or by working with the stateâ€™s revenue department.
