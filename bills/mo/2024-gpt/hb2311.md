summary: |
  The bill updates the rules for paying county sheriffs in Missouri, especially focusing on counties classified as third and fourth. It sets new salary amounts based on a percentage of what an associate circuit judge earns. Sheriffs in counties of first and second classification will earn about 80% of a judgeâ€™s salary, while those in third and fourth classification counties will get a salary determined by certain percentage brackets depending on county property value. The bill also encourages sheriffs to complete training related to their job by providing a small extra pay and reimbursing training expenses. Overall, the measure aims to ensure fair compensation for sheriffs across different counties, without reducing their current pay.
