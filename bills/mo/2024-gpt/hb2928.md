summary_short: "This bill changes the rules about foreign ownership of real estate and agricultural land in Missouri starting August 28, 2024."

summary: |
  This bill updates Missouri laws regarding who can own real estate and farmland in the state. Starting August 28, 2024, it allows non-citizens and foreign companies to buy and own most types of real estate, except for agricultural land, which now has stricter rules. Foreign individuals and businesses that owned land before this date can continue to hold it but cannot transfer it to new foreign owners after August 28, 2024. Additionally, no foreign person or business will be able to purchase agricultural land in Missouri if foreign ownership exceeds 1% of the total farmland. These changes are designed to regulate foreign ownership, especially in agricultural land, and affect international investors and foreign companies in Missouri.
