summary: |
  This bill makes important changes to Missouriâ€™s parole process. It requires the parole board to conduct a risk and needs assessment for each offender before granting parole. Offenders will usually have a personal hearing or interview, unless they waive it or rules allow otherwise. The bill also specifies that parole is meant to protect public safety and help offenders reintegrate into society, but it isn't a form of clemency or a reduction of their sentence. Additionally, the bill allows the Department of Probation and Parole to charge offenders small monthly fees to help fund services like treatment, mental health support, and electronic monitoring. The rules for parole eligibility and conditions are to be set by the parole board, and specific calculations are clarified for offenders with consecutive sentences. The changes aim to make the parole process clearer, more consistent, and focused on public safety and offender support.
