  This bill establishes a new Office of Inspector General (OIG) within the Missouri Department of Social Services. The OIG will be led by an appointee chosen for integrity and expertise, and it will operate independently to conduct audits and investigations related to social services programs. The office will help ensure transparency, detect fraud or abuse, and report its findings to the governor and the legislature, while being protected from interference by political or departmental officials.
