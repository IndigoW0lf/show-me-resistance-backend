summary_short: "This bill stops state departments from using money on diversity, equity, and inclusion programs that promote preferential treatment or divisive identities."

summary: |
  The bill prohibits state government departments from spending funds on programs, staff, or initiatives related to diversity, equity, inclusion, or similar concepts that focus on race, gender, religion, or ethnicity. It aims to prevent efforts that promote special treatment based on these groups or ideas that suggest disparities are only due to oppression. However, it allows departments to follow existing laws about equal opportunity and anti-discrimination. It also prevents the state from requiring private companies that do business with the state to adopt these kinds of programs as a condition for contracts.
