summary_short: "A proposed constitutional change in Missouri aims to clarify and strengthen firearm rights while allowing local governments to regulate gun possession and carry through ordinances."
summary: |
  This bill proposes a new constitutional amendment in Missouri that would replace the current gun rights section with clearer language affirming citizens' rights to keep and bear arms for self-defense and related purposes. It requires any restrictions on these rights to be carefully scrutinized and ensures the state must protect against their infringement. The bill also allows cities like St. Louis and Kansas City to create local laws regulating firearms, including issuing permits and setting penalties, as long as those laws follow certain rules. The amendment would impact gun owners, law enforcement, and local governments by defining firearm rights and permitting local regulation within the framework of state and federal law.
