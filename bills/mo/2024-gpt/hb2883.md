  This law allows veterans in Missouri who have been diagnosed with traumatic brain injury or PTSD related to their military service to try alternative treatments like hyperbaric oxygen therapy, therapy with horses, music therapy, and service animal training. The veterans' commission can work with healthcare providers and educational institutions to provide and oversee these treatments.
