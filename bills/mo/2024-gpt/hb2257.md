summary_short: "This bill sets aside gold and silver reserves for the state and updates how Missouri residents' income taxes are calculated."

summary: |
  This law makes two main changes. First, it requires the state of Missouri to keep at least 1% of all its funds in gold and silver in the state treasury, though it doesn't force the state to invest in ways that break existing constitutional rules. Second, it adjusts the way residents' income is calculated for tax purposes, adding back certain federal refunds, interest, and deductions that are normally excluded or deducted under federal law. These changes could impact residents' tax bills and the state's financial reserves.
