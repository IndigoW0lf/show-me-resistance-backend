summary: |
  This bill, known as "Blair's Law," creates a new crime called "unlawful discharge of a firearm." It applies to people who fire a gun within city or town limits when they are negligent. There are important exceptions, such as shooting at a range, during lawful hunting seasons, or in self-defense. If someone is found guilty of this crime, they could face penalties ranging from a misdemeanor to a felony, depending on how many times they have committed the offense. This law aims to improve safety in communities by reducing illegal firearm discharges and clarifying when discharging a firearm is lawful.
