summary_short: "This bill updates rules for how doctors and registered nurses work together, especially allowing nurses with advanced training to prescribe certain medications under written agreements."

summary: |
  This bill changes the laws in Missouri to improve how doctors and registered nurses collaborate in providing healthcare. It allows physicians to create written agreements, called collaborative practice arrangements, which let nurses take on more responsibilities, such as administering and prescribing medications. Advanced practice registered nurses (such as nurse practitioners) will be able to prescribe certain controlled substances, including some opioids, for specific purposes like hospice care and substance use treatment, within clear limits. These changes aim to give nurses more authority to help deliver quality healthcare and make services more accessible, especially in areas with fewer doctors.
