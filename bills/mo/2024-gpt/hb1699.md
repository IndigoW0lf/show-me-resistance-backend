summary_short: "This bill bans Missouri state contracts with companies that engage in economic boycotts based on certain social, environmental, or governance issues."

summary: |
  This law prohibits Missouri state government agencies and local governments from entering into contracts worth $50,000 or more with companies that refuse to do business with other companies because of their involvement in activities related to fossil fuels, firearms, environmental standards, human rights, or reproductive and gender health, unless those actions are for a normal business purpose. This means that if a company politically or socially boycotts or stops working with another business over these issues, the government cannot do business with that company. The law aims to prevent public funds from supporting companies that use economic boycotts to promote or oppose certain social or environmental causes. It will mainly affect larger companies and government contracts, ensuring transparency and aligning public spending with specific policy standards.
