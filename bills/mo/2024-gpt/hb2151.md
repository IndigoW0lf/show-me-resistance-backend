summary_short: "This bill increases the amount of state funds available to support regional planning commissions and adjusts funding limits annually for inflation."
summary: |
  The bill changes how Missouri distributes state funds to regional planning commissions, which help with community development and regional projects. It ensures that for every dollar of local funds provided by these commissions, the state will add half as much money, up to certain maximum amounts. Some larger commissions, like the East-West Gateway and Mid-America councils, can receive up to $130,000, while others can receive up to $50,000 each. Starting in July 2025, the maximum funds for each commission will increase each year based on inflation, making sure the funding stays fair and consistent over time. This impacts local governments and regional agencies that rely on these funds for planning efforts.
