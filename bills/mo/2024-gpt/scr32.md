summary_short: "This resolution urges Missouri's congressional delegation to support ongoing funding for the Affordable Connectivity Program to help low-income households access the internet."
summary: |
  This bill is a formal request from Missouri's state government asking members of Congress to continue funding the Affordable Connectivity Program (ACP). The ACP helps low-income families and individuals, including those on tribal land, by providing discounts on internet services and computers. Currently, many Missouri households are eligible for this assistance, which is important for closing the digital divide and ensuring everyone can participate in the digital economy. Without continued funding, the support may run out by spring 2024, making it harder for those in need to get online and access vital services.
