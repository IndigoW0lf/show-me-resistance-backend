summary_short: "This bill provides funding to help public schools hire school nurses and mental health professionals."

summary: |
  The bill allows public schools in Missouri to apply for state money to hire school nurses and mental health professionals. Schools that qualify can receive a financial supplement to pay the salary of a licensed school nurse, with preferences given to those with greater need based on factors like student health needs and poverty levels. The funds are stored in a special state account and must be used only for this purpose. This helps schools improve student health services and support students' well-being.
