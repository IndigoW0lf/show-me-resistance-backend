summary_short: "Children’s confessions obtained through deception during police interrogation cannot be used as evidence in court."

summary: |
  This bill makes it illegal to use confessions from children under 18 as evidence if those confessions were obtained through deception during police questioning. Specifically, if a child is interrogated in custody—meaning they are taken to a detention location and questioned in a way a reasonable person would feel they are not free to leave—and the police knowingly deceive the child about evidence or offer false promises, then any confession made cannot be used in court. The purpose is to protect children from unfair interrogation tactics and ensure that their statements are voluntarily given without manipulation. This law affects law enforcement agencies, juvenile justice, and children involved in legal processes.
