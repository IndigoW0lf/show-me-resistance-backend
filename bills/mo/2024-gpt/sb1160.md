summary_short: "This bill updates Missouri's rules about small renewable energy systems and how customers can use net metering to get credit for excess electricity they produce."
summary: |
  This legislation changes the laws in Missouri related to net metering, which allows small renewable energy generators—like solar panels—to send surplus electricity back to the grid and get credited for it. It defines who qualifies as a customer-generator, sets a cap of 100 kW for system size, and ensures systems meet safety and performance standards. The bill also requires utility companies to offer net metering on a first-come, first-served basis until the total capacity reaches 5% of the utility's peak demand. Overall, it aims to make it easier and more fair for residents and businesses using renewable energy to participate in net metering.
