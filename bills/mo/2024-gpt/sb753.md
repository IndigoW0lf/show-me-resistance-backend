  The Commercial Financing Disclosure Law, part of Bill SB753, mandates that businesses provide clear information about specific commercial financing transactions. It defines key terms such as "account," "business," and "commercial financing," and explains when a transaction is considered a business purpose or involving accounts receivable. The law mainly affects businesses, lenders, and brokers involved in financing deals, ensuring they disclose important details to help consumers and businesses understand the terms of their financing agreements. This transparency aims to protect buyers and promote fair practices in commercial financing.
