summary: |
  This bill updates Missouri law to clarify and adjust the minimum time an offender must serve in prison for certain serious crimes. It applies to specific felony offenses and sets minimum prison terms based on whether someone has previous prison commitments for unrelated felonies. For example, offenders with one prior prison sentence must serve at least 40% of their new sentence, while those with three or more previous commitments must serve at least 80%. The bill aims to modify how minimum sentences are calculated and ensure consistent sentencing for repeat offenders.
