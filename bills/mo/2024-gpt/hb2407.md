summary: |
  The Missouri legislature has passed a bill that creates a new program called the "Workforce Housing Tax Incentives Program." This program provides tax benefits to housing developers, contractors, and nonprofits involved in building or rehabilitating affordable housing, especially in areas affected by disasters or on certain types of properties like brownfield, grayfield, or greenfield sites. It aims to promote the creation and improvement of housing for workers and disaster-affected communities, making it easier and more affordable to develop housing projects. The bill specifies definitions for key terms and sets rules for how the program operates, impacting developers, local governments, and communities across Missouri.
