summary: |
  This bill recognizes that Missouri Southern State University has demonstrated it can successfully take on new roles. The university will now be a statewide leader in health and life sciences, immersive learning experiences, and international or global education, in addition to its current mission. The Missouri Senate and House of Representatives approved this change, and it will now be sent to the Governor for final approval. This means the university can grow its programs and offer more opportunities for students across the state.
