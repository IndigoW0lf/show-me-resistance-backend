summary: |
  The bill adds a list of significant historic trails in Missouri to officially recognize their importance. It directs the state Department of Transportation or relevant department to place at least two signs along each trail, with one sign at the start of each trail. If a trail extends beyond Missouri's borders, signs will be placed where the trail enters and leaves the state. This helps inform the public and preserve Missouri’s historic routes, affecting travelers, historians, and local communities interested in Missouri’s heritage.
