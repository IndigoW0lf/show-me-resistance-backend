summary: |
  This bill changes existing laws to clarify how community paramedics in Missouri are trained and certified. It requires paramedics to be licensed and to complete approved certification programs.

It affects emergency medical responders, ambulance providers, and hospitals by expanding options for nonemergency health care services delivered by trained paramedics outside of immediate emergency situations.
