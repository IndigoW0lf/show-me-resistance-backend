summary_short: "This bill changes the rules for who can qualify for the A+ Scholarship program in Missouri, including new requirements for schools and students."
summary: |
  This bill updates Missouri's A+ School Program by establishing new standards for secondary schools to qualify for grants, such as setting performance goals, offering rigorous coursework, and developing partnerships with community and business leaders. It encourages schools to ensure all students graduate, complete challenging high school courses, and gain college credits or work skills. Additionally, it opens the program to nonpublic schools that meet the same requirements, making it easier for more students to access postsecondary financial aid through the A+ Scholarship.
