summary_short: "This bill abolishes the Department of Elementary and Secondary Education and transfers its responsibilities and assets to other state agencies."
summary: |
  The bill eliminates the current Department of Elementary and Secondary Education in Missouri. Instead of one department managing elementary and secondary education, its powers, staff, and property will be transferred to various other state agencies through a planned reorganization by the governor. This includes transferring responsibilities related to public schools, special education, and schools for the deaf and blind. The existing structure and leadership, such as the state board of education and the commissioner of education, will continue to play roles in overseeing the reforms. The changes aim to improve how education services are managed across the state, affecting students, educators, and educational institutions.
