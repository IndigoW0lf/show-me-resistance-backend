summary_short: "This bill creates a uniform process for courts in Missouri to handle depositions and discovery requests from other states."
summary: |
  The bill establishes the "Uniform Interstate Depositions and Discovery Act" to make it easier for Missouri courts to manage legal investigations involving parties from outside the state. It allows parties to request subpoenas from courts in Missouri for depositions, documents, or inspections based on foreign court orders, without needing to appear in court. The law sets clear rules for how these subpoenas are issued, served, and enforced, ensuring consistency with Missouriâ€™s legal procedures. This change primarily affects legal professionals, businesses, and individuals involved in interstate legal cases, making cross-state discovery more straightforward and efficient.
