summary_short: "This bill removes the requirement for certain vehicle dealers to undergo place of business inspections."
summary: |
  The bill updates the rules for vehicle dealers in Missouri by exempting some from regular place-of-business inspections. Specifically, some vehicle dealers, like those with a permanent, clearly marked location that is accessible to the public, no longer need to be inspected by law enforcement as part of their licensing or renewal process. This change mainly affects new motor vehicle dealers, used car dealers, boat dealers, and powersport dealers who have a permanent and visible physical location where they conduct business. The goal is to streamline processes for certain dealerships while maintaining standards for a bona fide business location.
