summary: |
  This bill makes it mandatory for scrap metal dealers and junkyard operators to keep detailed records of all purchases, especially those involving specific materials like copper, aluminum, and catalytic converters. Dealers must record information such as IDs, transaction details, vehicle license plates, and vehicle identification numbers for catalytic converters. The law also restricts transactions involving catalytic converters to a fixed business location, requiring a waiting period before processing them. Penalties are established for knowingly purchasing stolen catalytic converters, including hefty fines and license revocations. This bill primarily targets scrap metal businesses, law enforcement, and anyone involved in buying or selling scrap materials to help reduce theft and illegal activity.
