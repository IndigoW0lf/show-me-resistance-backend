summary: |
  This bill sets rules about how reproductive and sexual health information collected by apps or websites can be used. It says that companies cannot share, sell, or use this information without the person's clear permission each time. It also restricts government agencies from asking for this info unless it's just for a criminal investigation and not for other reasons like checking if someone accessed services in another state or tracking pregnancy outcomes. The goal is to protect people's private health details from being accessed or misused without their consent.
