summary_short: "This law bans most uses of choke-holds and carotid restraints by police, allowing them only in very specific self-defense situations, and mandates discipline or loss of license if used improperly."
summary: |
  This bill makes it illegal for law enforcement officers to use respiratory choke-holds or carotid restraints against a person, except when they are defending themselves or others from serious injury or death. A choke-hold involves applying pressure to someone's neck to control their breathing, while a carotid restraint involves pressing on the arteries to restrict blood flow without blocking breathing. Police officers caught using these methods improperly or outside of allowed situations could face immediate firing and loss of their license to serve as a law enforcement officer. The aim is to reduce the use of potentially dangerous restraint tactics and increase officer accountability.
