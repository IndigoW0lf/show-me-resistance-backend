summary: |
  This legislation authorizes the governor of Missouri to grant a 40-foot-wide easement on a specific property located in Laclede County to the City of Lebanon. An easement is a legal right to use someone else's land for a specific purpose, in this case likely for transportation or utility access. The bill describes the exact location and boundaries of the land involved and states that the terms of the transfer will be set by the commissioner of administration. It also requires the attorney general to approve the paperwork for the transfer. This bill mainly impacts state and local government agencies, and the City of Lebanon, by formalizing the process to transfer this land access right for public or municipal use.
