summary_short: "Allows students to take a three-hour leave from school to vote on Election Day without penalty."

summary: |
  This bill gives students the right to leave school for up to three hours on Election Day in order to vote. The leave is considered an excused absence if the student requests it before Election Day. Schools can choose which three hours during the day students can leave. School officials who prevent students from voting or deny this leave could face penalties. The bill also requires school districts to create and follow policies about these absences starting in the 2024-25 school year.
