summary: |
  The bill sets strict limits on how much correctional centers and jails can charge inmates for making domestic phone calls. It specifies that no facility can charge more than twelve cents per minute for calls made within the state. For jails, the maximum charge depends on the number of inmates: larger jails (with 1,000 or more inmates) cannot charge more than fourteen cents per minute, while smaller jails (with fewer than 1,000 inmates) are limited to twenty-one cents per minute. This bill aims to make phone calls more affordable for inmates and their families while ensuring fair pricing by correctional institutions.
