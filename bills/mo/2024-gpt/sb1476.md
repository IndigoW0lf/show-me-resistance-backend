summary: |
  This bill changes the law to specifically include vehicles operated by county and city park rangers as emergency vehicles. It means that drivers must yield the right-of-way to these park ranger vehicles when they have their lights and sirens on or are stationary with red, blue, or amber lights. The bill also clarifies how drivers should behave when they see stationary emergency vehicles or park ranger vehicles, and specifies who qualifies as an emergency vehicle under the law. Overall, it helps ensure that park rangers and similar officials are recognized as emergency responders and that drivers respond appropriately to their signals.
