summary_short: "This resolution urges Congress to bring back mandatory labeling showing where meat products come from in the U.S."

summary: |
  This bill is a resolution that encourages the United States Congress to restart requiring food products like beef and pork to clearly show their country of origin. It highlights that American farmers, ranchers, and consumers benefit when people can easily identify whether meat is produced in the U.S., supporting local businesses and food safety standards. The resolution also points out that previous rules about country-of-origin labeling were removed in 2015, which has made it harder to tell American meat apart from imported products. Overall, it aims to promote transparency, protect American farmers, and ensure consumers know where their food comes from.
