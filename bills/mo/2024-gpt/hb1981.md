summary: |
  This bill changes the rules for student participation in school sports by specifying that students must compete in categories matching their biological sex, as listed on their birth certificates or government records. It states that students assigned female at birth can only compete in female-designated sports and students assigned male at birth can only compete in male-designated sports, unless a female event is not available. Schools that do not follow these rules could lose state funding and may face legal actions from students or parents who are affected. The goal is to promote fair competition and address historical disparities between male and female athletes.
