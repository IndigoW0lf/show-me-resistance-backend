summary: |
 Missouri will require health insurance plans to cover self-administered hormonal contraceptives, such as birth control pills, patches, or rings, for up to a year. Beginning January 1, 2025, insurers must reimburse healthcare providers or pharmacies for providing these contraceptives without charging higher deductibles or co-pays than other similar health services. This change aims to make birth control more accessible and affordable for those covered by insurance, helping individuals better manage their reproductive health.
