summary: |
  The bill updates Missouri law to include tianeptine as a Schedule I drug. This classification is reserved for substances with a high potential for abuse, no accepted medical treatment use in the U.S., and safety concerns under medical supervision. By making this change, the law makes it illegal to manufacture, sell, or possess tianeptine without special permission. This affects anyone involved in the production, distribution, and use of this substance in Missouri, aiming to prevent misuse and protect public health.
