summary_short: "This bill sets rules for how insurance companies pay healthcare providers, ensuring timely and proper payments."
summary: |
  The bill updates Missouri laws to improve how insurance companies pay healthcare providers like doctors, hospitals, and dentists. It requires insurers to pay providers directly within 30 days after receiving all necessary claims documents, especially when patients get care from out-of-network providers. The law aims to make payments clearer and faster, helping providers get paid promptly. It also clarifies situations where payments can be made directly to providers even if the insurance policy has specific network rules. This affects insurance companies, healthcare providers, and policyholders by promoting transparency and timely compensation for health services.
