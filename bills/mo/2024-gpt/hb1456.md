summary_short: "This bill updates the laws on alternative dispute resolution, including mediation and arbitration, to improve how disputes are settled outside court in Missouri."
summary: |
  The bill replaces existing rules about alternative dispute resolution (ADR) with new laws that clarify what ADR is and how it works. It defines key terms like mediation, arbitration, and early neutral evaluation, and explains how these processes can be used to settle civil disagreements. The law also sets rules about communications made during ADR and addresses issues like conflicts of interest. This affects anyone involved in civil disputes in Missouri, including parties, mediators, and arbitrators, by providing clearer guidelines for resolving issues outside of court.
