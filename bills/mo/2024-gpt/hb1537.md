summary: |
  This bill changes the law to include staff members of the Division of Youth Services as "special victims." This means that if these staff members are assaulted while carrying out their official duties, they will have additional legal protections. The law already covers certain groups like law enforcement, emergency personnel, elderly and disabled persons, and jailers, and now it also explicitly protects staff working with youth services. The change helps ensure staff working with vulnerable young people are recognized and protected in case they are targeted during their work.
