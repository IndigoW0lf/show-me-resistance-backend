summary: |
  This bill, SB1176, updates Missouri law to permit businesses that are already licensed to sell alcohol to also deliver intoxicating liquor to customers away from their premises. Delivery can be made through common carriers, employees of the business, or third-party agents designated by the retailer. The bill gives the Alcohol and Tobacco Control division the authority to create rules for how these deliveries should be carried out. These rules will help ensure that alcohol delivery is done responsibly and legally, affecting licensed alcohol sellers and delivery service providers in Missouri.
