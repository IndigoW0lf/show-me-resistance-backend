summary: |
  This bill changes how Missouri schools support students' mental health, especially around suicide prevention. It requires teachers and other licensed educators to participate in training each year on suicide awareness and prevention. Starting from the 2023-24 school year, districts will offer at least two hours of in-service training on this topic. The bill also introduces new guidelines and tools, such as the Columbia Protocol for assessing suicide risk and a virtual support tool for teachers. These updates aim to better prepare school staff to recognize and respond to mental health issues among students, benefiting both educators and students across the state.
