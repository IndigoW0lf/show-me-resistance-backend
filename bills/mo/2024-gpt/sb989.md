summary: |
  The bill, known as the "Keep Your Ground Act," changes existing laws to ensure that if someoneâ€™s conduct is justified as self-defense, they cannot be held financially liable in a civil lawsuit. Essentially, it means that when a person is legally justified in defending themselves, they won't face civil damages or legal responsibility for their actions. This update provides increased legal protection for individuals acting in lawful self-defense and clarifies that such justified actions cannot be used against them in civil court. It affects anyone involved in self-defense situations in Missouri, offering clearer protections under the law.
