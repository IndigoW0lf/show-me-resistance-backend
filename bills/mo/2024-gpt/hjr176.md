summary: |
  The bill modifies rules for amending Missouri's constitution, including who can vote on these changes and how they are proposed. It clarifies that only registered Missouri voters can participate and sets new requirements for signature gathering for initiative petitionsâ€”specifically, signatures must come from 7% of voters in two-thirds of the congressional districts. It also updates procedures for submitting amendments to voters, such as publication rules and timing. The goal is to make the process clearer and more consistent, affecting voters, lawmakers, and organizations proposing amendments.
