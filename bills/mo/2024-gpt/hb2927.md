  This law makes it illegal for people who have been involved in domestic violence to own or carry firearms. It also updates rules for courts when issuing protection orders, which can include safety measures like keeping the abuser away from the victim's home, children, or personal property. The bill helps protect victims by allowing courts to set custody arrangements, support payments, and require abusers to participate in counseling. These changes directly affect individuals involved in domestic violence cases, law enforcement, and the courts to enhance safety and prevent firearm access by abusive partners.
