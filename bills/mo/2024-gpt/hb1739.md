summary_short: "This law gives parents clearer rights to access their children's school records, materials, and information about school activities in public schools in Missouri."
summary: |
  The bill, called the "Parents' Bill of Rights Act of 2024," establishes new rules that allow parents or guardians to review and obtain information about their child's education and safety in public schools, including charter and virtual schools. Parents have the right to see curricula, teaching materials, and records within two business days of request, as well as information about people who teach their children and how their child's data is collected and shared. Schools cannot require parents to sign non-disclosure agreements to review curriculum materials, and there are protections in place to keep student privacy confidential. Overall, the bill aims to increase transparency and give parents more access to their children's education information.
