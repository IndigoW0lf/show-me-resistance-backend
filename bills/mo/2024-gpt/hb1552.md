summary: |
  This bill changes the rules for obtaining Missouri conservation license plates. Vehicle owners can apply each year to display the foundation's emblem on their license plates by paying a $25 fee. Once approved, they can get a special license plate that features the foundation's emblem and an additional $15 fee is added to their registration costs. The funds collected go directly to the Missouri Conservation Heritage Foundation to support conservation efforts. If a vehicle owner does not provide proof of emblem use when renewing their registration, their license plate will no longer bear the foundationâ€™s emblem. This bill affects vehicle owners who want to support conservation when renewing their vehicle registration.
