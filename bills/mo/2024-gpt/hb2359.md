summary: |
  This bill changes the laws about how law enforcement can interview children when they are taken into custody. It requires police and juvenile officers to tell children their rights before questioning, including their right to remain silent, have a parent or guardian present, and speak with an attorney. The bill also says that if a child asks to stop talking or to have a parent present, the questioning must end until the child is ready. Additionally, recordings of the child's interviews are presumed to be valid and can be used in court. The goal is to better protect childrenâ€™s rights during investigations and ensure proper procedures are followed.
