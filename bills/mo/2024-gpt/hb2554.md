summary_short: "This bill requires the Missouri legislature to approve certain administrative rules before they can take effect."
summary: |
  The bill changes the process for implementing new rules by state agencies. Now, any proposed rule must be submitted to the Missouri General Assembly for approval before it can become official and enforceable. This means the legislature has more oversight, and rules with large costs or important impacts cannot automatically take effect. The bill also allows the legislature to approve rules through a formal resolution, providing an extra layer of review and control over agency decisions that affect the public.
