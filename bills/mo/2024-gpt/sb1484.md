summary_short: "This bill allows certain counties in Missouri to choose to impose a small sales tax to help pay for hospital services."

summary: |
  This bill gives specific counties in Missouri the authority to add a 1% sales tax on retail sales made within their boundaries. The county voters must approve this tax through an election before it can be implemented. The money collected from this tax will only be used to support local hospital services, helping improve healthcare in those counties. This applies to counties with populations between about 15,700 and 17,600 residents that have a county seat with a population between roughly 4,210 and 6,000 residents. If voters decide to approve the tax, it will start collecting the second quarter after the election and can be repealed later if voters choose.
