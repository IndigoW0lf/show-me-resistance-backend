summary_short: "This bill updates laws to make it a crime to support terrorist groups or drug cartels, with penalties."
summary: |
  The bill changes existing laws to clearly define supporting terrorist organizations and drug cartels as criminal offenses. It specifies that providing any kind of support—like money, weapons, or safe places—to designated foreign terrorist groups or drug cartels involved in illegal drug trafficking, especially fentanyl, is a crime. Supporting such groups could include giving money, weapons, transportation, or information, but not medicine or religious items. If someone is found guilty of supporting these groups, they can face serious legal penalties. This law helps law enforcement target organizations involved in terrorism and drug trafficking to protect public safety.
