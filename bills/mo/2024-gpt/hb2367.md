summary_short: "This bill makes it a crime to be in Missouri illegally if caught on private or public property while violating certain laws."
summary: |
  The bill creates a new law in Missouri that makes it a crime for someone who is in the country illegally to be on property and break other laws, like moving around without proper permission. If an illegal alien commits another offense, such as trespassing, they can be charged with an added crime called "trespass by an illegal alien," which is a serious felony. This law applies unless the person has official permission from the federal government to stay in the U.S. The bill aims to address illegal immigration violations and their consequences on local property and laws.
