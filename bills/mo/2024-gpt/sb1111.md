summary: |
  This bill, SB1111, establishes regulations for certain child care facilities in Missouri that serve children under age six with serious medical conditions requiring ongoing nursing care. It requires these facilities to obtain a license from the Department of Health and Senior Services to operate legally, starting August 28, 2025. The law specifies what qualifies as this type of care, outlines the powers of the department to inspect and license facilities, and sets standards to ensure the safety and well-being of eligible children. It also clarifies existing exemptions, such as hospitals and mental health programs, which are not affected by these new licensing requirements. This legislation aims to improve oversight and safety for vulnerable children needing specialized care.
