summary_short: "Proposes a Missouri constitutional amendment to protect and regulate gun rights and allow local ordinances for firearms."  
summary: |
  This bill is a proposed change to the Missouri Constitution that would guarantee that citizens have the right to keep and bear arms, including ammunition and accessories, for personal defense and law enforcement support. It would replace an existing section of the state constitution with new language emphasizing that these rights are unalienable and must be protected, while also allowing laws to restrict gun rights for convicted violent offenders or those deemed dangerous due to mental health issues. Additionally, it authorizes cities like St. Louis and Kansas City to create local rules about carrying and possessing guns, including fees for permits and recognition of permits from other areas, with certain exemptions for law enforcement, judges, security personnel, and military members. This change would take effect after being approved by voters in the 2024 election and would impact gun owners, local governments, and law enforcement agencies.
