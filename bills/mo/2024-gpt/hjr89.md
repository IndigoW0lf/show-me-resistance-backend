summary_short: "This bill proposes amending Missouri's Constitution to recognize all human life from conception, including in utero, as protected under the law."

summary: |
  The bill, HJR89, seeks to change the Missouri Constitution to explicitly affirm that every human being, from the moment of conception until birth, has a natural right to life. This includes all in utero humans at any stage of development. The proposed change clarifies that the constitution does not secure the right to abortion or require public funding for it. If approved by voters in the 2024 election, it would reinforce protections for unborn babies and influence future laws and policies related to reproductive rights in Missouri.
