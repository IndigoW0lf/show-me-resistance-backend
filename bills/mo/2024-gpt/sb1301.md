summary_short: "States new rules for the Missouri Works economic development program to encourage job creation with tax incentives and capital investment support."
summary: |
  This bill updates the Missouri Works program to provide tax benefits to companies that create new jobs in Missouri. Companies that meet certain job creation and wage standards may keep a portion of their withholding taxes for up to six years, depending on whether they are new or existing businesses. Additionally, the state may award extra tax credits to support companies that create enough jobs and invest in facilities, especially in rural or special zones. The goal is to promote economic growth, new investments, and job opportunities across Missouri while ensuring that the benefits are balanced with the state's fiscal interests.
