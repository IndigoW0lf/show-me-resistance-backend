summary_short: "This bill updates Missouri's child custody laws to clarify types of custody and establish that the best interests of the child guide custody decisions, including a presumption favoring shared parenting time."
summary: |
  This law changes how child custody is determined in Missouri. It defines different types of custody, such as joint legal custody (both parents share decision-making), joint physical custody (the child spends significant time with each parent), and third-party custody (a guardian other than the parents). The law also sets a default assumption that having roughly equal time with both parents is usually in the child's best interests, unless evidence shows otherwise. Courts will consider various factors, like the child's relationship with each parent, the parents' ability to cooperate, and the child's needs, to decide what's best. This affects parents, guardians, and family court decisions by clarifying rules for custody arrangements and emphasizing the child's well-being.
