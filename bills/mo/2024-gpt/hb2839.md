summary: |
  The bill mandates that all assisted living and residential care facilities must install an alert system, such as a wired intercom, wireless pager, buzzer, or hand bell. Each residentâ€™s bedroom and bathroom must have a call button or device to alert staff when help is needed. The system should also be loud enough for staff to hear from their work areas. This aims to improve resident safety and ensure prompt assistance in these facilities.
