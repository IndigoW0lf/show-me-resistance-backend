summary_short: "This bill updates rules about how insurance documents are produced, kept, and examined by authorities."

summary: |
  This legislation changes the laws regarding insurance companies and agents in Missouri. It clarifies how the insurance director can investigate violations, examine documents, and gather information, including requiring witnesses to testify under oath. The bill also sets new rules about how long insurance companies must keep records—at least 30 business days after a request—and limits access to records that are beyond their required retention period unless there is evidence of serious misconduct or criminal activity. These changes aim to improve transparency, investigations, and record-keeping practices within the insurance industry.
