summary_short: "This bill makes changes to how health care providers are reimbursed by insurance companies, ensuring they are not required to pay fees or discounts to get paid."
summary: |
  This law updates rules for health insurance companies and their payment practices. It says that insurance companies cannot force health care providers to pay extra fees, discounts, or give any other remuneration just to get paid for their services. If an insurance company wants to change how they pay providers to a method that requires such payments, they must get approval from the provider first. Providers also have the right to decline certain reimbursement methods and can choose to be paid electronically through a secure bank transfer. These measures aim to protect providers from unfair payment practices and give them more control over how they get reimbursed.
