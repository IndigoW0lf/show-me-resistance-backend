summary_short: "Requires long-term care facilities to have and maintain 24/7 video and audio surveillance in common areas and resident room entryways, and establishes rules for providing recordings to residents or their representatives."
summary: |
  This bill mandates that long-term care facilities like nursing homes and assisted living centers install and operate continuous video and audio monitoring systems in common areas and around resident room entrances. The facilities must keep recordings for a certain period and provide copies to residents or their families if needed for investigations, within five days. The bill also protects residentsâ€™ privacy by allowing blurring of unclothed individuals in recordings and limits liability for facilities related to the recordings. It aims to increase safety, transparency, and accountability in long-term care settings.
