summary_short: "This bill encourages child placement agencies to consider religious faith matching when placing children in foster care."
summary: |
  The bill changes Missouri law to prioritize placing children in foster care with individuals or agencies that share the child's or the parents' religious faith, if possible. If the child's specific faith isn't known, then the placement should match the faith of either parent. This aims to respect religious beliefs and promote comfort and stability for children and families involved in foster care. It affects courts, child welfare agencies, and foster families in Missouri.
