summary: |
  The Missouri Universal School Meals Act requires all schools in Missouri to provide free meals to students who request them, regardless of their ability to pay. Schools will identify students eligible for free or reduced-price meals and help parents fill out the necessary forms, but they cannot publicly disclose a child's eligibility to avoid stigmatization. The state will create a fund to reimburse schools for meals that aren't covered by federal programs, ensuring that no student is denied a meal due to cost. This legislation aims to make nutritious meals accessible to all students and reduce hunger in schools.
