summary_short: "This bill improves rules about reporting violations involving children in schools and about volunteers working with students."
summary: |
  This bill makes changes to how schools in Missouri handle information about former employees and volunteers who work with students. It requires schools to have written policies on sharing information about these individuals when they apply for new jobs at other schools. Starting in 2025, these policies must also include details about screened volunteers and any misconduct related to sexual allegations. The bill is designed to help protect students by ensuring schools share important safety information and prevent individuals with misconduct from working with children again.
