  This bill updates the rules for how members are chosen for the Missouri Clean Water Commission. It creates a new commission with seven members appointed by the governor, with specific requirements that include knowledge of water quality and interests related to agriculture, industry, and wastewater treatment. The bill also limits the number of members from the same political party and requires members to avoid conflicts of interest. These changes aim to ensure the commission is knowledgeable, balanced, and focused on protecting water quality for all Missourians.
