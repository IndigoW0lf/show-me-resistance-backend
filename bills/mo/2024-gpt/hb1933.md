summary_short: "This bill updates the laws in Missouri to clarify when and how parental rights can be terminated to better protect children."
summary: |
  The bill revises Missouri's laws regarding the protection of children by setting clear rules for ending a parent's rights if they have been absent, neglected, or committed serious crimes against their children. It allows anyone to refer information about a child's safety to juvenile officers, who then decide whether to take further action. The law specifies specific conditions under which parental rights can be terminated, such as prolonged foster care, abandonment, or severe criminal acts like murder or felony assault involving the child. These changes aim to improve how child protection cases are handled and ensure that children's safety and well-being are prioritized.
