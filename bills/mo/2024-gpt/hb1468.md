  This bill changes the responsibilities of the Missouri State Tax Commission to make property assessments more accurate and fair. It gives the Commission the authority to adjust property values, require reports from officers, and correct assessment errors throughout the year. The bill also enhances efforts to prevent tax evasion by studying other states' laws, and it improves software systems used for determining property tax amounts.
