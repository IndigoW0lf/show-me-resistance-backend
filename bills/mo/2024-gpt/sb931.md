summary: |
  This bill changes the laws about telehealth (remote healthcare services) in Missouri. It defines key terms like "distant site," "originating site," and "telemedicine" to clarify how remote healthcare can be delivered. The bill makes it easier for licensed health care providers in the state to offer telehealth services, as long as they follow the same standards as in-person care. It also allows out-of-state providers to give certain quick or emergency consultations without violating licensing rules. Overall, the bill aims to improve access to healthcare through technology while maintaining safety and professionalism.
