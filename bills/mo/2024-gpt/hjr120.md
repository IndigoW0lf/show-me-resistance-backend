summary_short: "This bill proposes a constitutional amendment to change how residential property is assessed for taxes in Missouri, including rules for increasing assessments starting in 2025."
summary: |
  This legislation suggests changing the Missouri Constitution to update how residential property assessments for taxes are handled. Starting in 2025, the assessed value of residential properties can only increase based on either the consumer price index (up to 2% annually) or improvements made to the property, whichever is less. It also clarifies the different classes of property and their assessment rules and allows assessors to lower property values if needed. The change aims to make property tax assessments more predictable and fair for homeowners.
