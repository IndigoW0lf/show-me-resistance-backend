summary_short: "This bill adds an exemption to the sunshine law, making certain records of state parks private unless required by law."
summary: |
  The bill changes existing laws to keep specific records related to state parks and other government activities private, unless there is a legal requirement to disclose them. It allows certain discussions, especially about legal actions, real estate transactions, employee decisions, and health or education records, to remain confidential. This primarily affects government agencies managing state parks, legal and real estate transactions, employee records, health services, and educational institutions. The goal is to clarify which records can be kept private and when they must be made public.
