summary_short: "This bill repeals the requirement for mammogram facilities to provide a specific notice about dense breast tissue and breast cancer risk factors."
summary: |
  This bill removes the current law that requires certified mammogram facilities to inform patients about dense breast tissue and its potential impact on breast cancer detection. Previously, facilities had to give patients a notice explaining that dense tissue could hide abnormalities and suggesting they discuss additional screening options with their doctor. The repeal means that, starting from January 1, 2015, these notices are no longer mandatory. This change primarily affects mammogram providers and patients undergoing breast cancer screening, simplifying the information they are required to share or receive.
