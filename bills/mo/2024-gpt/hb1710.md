summary_short: "This bill updates laws about abusing elderly, disabled, or vulnerable people, including new penalties."
summary: |
  This bill changes the rules about harming or neglecting elderly people, individuals with disabilities, or vulnerable persons. It makes it a crime to intentionally cause emotional distress through repeated actions, fail to provide necessary care, or knowingly put their health or safety at risk. Depending on the severity and the relationship (like being a care provider), the punishment can range from a misdemeanor to a more serious felony. The goal is to better protect these vulnerable groups and clarify the consequences for those who harm them.
