  This bill changes the rules for the land bank in Kansas City, Missouri. It requires the land bank to take legal steps called "quiet title" actions to confirm its ownership of properties. Before filing these legal actions, the land bank must identify all parties who have a claim or interest in the property. The bill also sets out how the land bank must notify interested parties and the timeline for the court process. These changes help the land bank manage and clear title to abandoned or unused properties more efficiently, benefiting the community by making property ownership clearer and enabling redevelopment.
