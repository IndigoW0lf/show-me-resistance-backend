summary: |
  This bill changes the laws about permits needed for managing solid waste, such as trash or landfill sites, in Missouri. It makes it illegal to operate or build a solid waste facility without first getting a permit from the Department of Natural Resources. The bill also requires a public involvement process for new disposal sites, including notifying the community and holding informational sessions. These rules affect companies and local governments planning to develop or manage waste disposal areas, ensuring they follow proper procedures and include the public in the decision-making process.
