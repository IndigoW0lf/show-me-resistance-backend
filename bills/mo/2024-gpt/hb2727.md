summary: |
  This bill, called the "Uniform Unlawful Restrictions in Land Records Act," makes it easier for property owners to remove illegal restrictions from their land records. It defines what constitutes unlawful restrictions—such as those based on race, religion, or other personal characteristics—and allows owners to submit a simple amendment to eliminate these restrictions from the official land records. Additionally, governing bodies of property associations can automatically amend their rules to remove unlawful restrictions without a vote, upon request by a member. This law aims to promote fair property transfer and use by removing discriminatory or illegal restrictions from public records, affecting property owners, associations, and land record officials.
