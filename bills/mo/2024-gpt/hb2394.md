  This bill mandates that health insurance plans in Missouri must cover genetic counseling and testing related to breast and ovarian cancer risks, specifically for the BRCA1 and BRCA2 genes. This coverage applies to individuals identified as being at increased risk due to personal or family medical history. Insurance companies are not allowed to charge patients for these services or use the results to decide on coverage, premiums, or other policy decisions. The goal is to make it easier and more affordable for people to access genetic testing related to cancer risk.
