summary: |
  The bill makes several changes to Missouriâ€™s election laws. It introduces new rules to improve the security of electronic voting equipment by requiring air-gapped systems, which are isolated from the internet to prevent hacking. It also defines important election terms such as "ballot," "cast vote record," and "electronic voting system," helping ensure everyone understands how votes are cast and counted. These updates aim to strengthen election security and clarity for election officials, voters, and candidates across the state.
