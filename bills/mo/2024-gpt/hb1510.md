summary: |
  This bill modifies existing laws to better define offenses involving motor vehicles in Missouri. It establishes that unlawfully entering a vehicle with the intent to commit a crime or theft is a serious crime, classified as a felony. Specifically, it makes it a Class E felony to try to open or enter multiple vehicles without permission, and a Class C or D felony if other conditions are metâ€”such as possessing a firearm or stealing it during a vehicle break-in. These changes aim to better address vehicle-related crimes and clarify penalties, affecting law enforcement, vehicle owners, and potential offenders.
