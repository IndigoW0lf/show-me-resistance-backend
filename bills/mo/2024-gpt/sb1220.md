summary: |
  The bill makes changes to the laws that determine how jurors in Missouri are compensated for their service. It clarifies that jurors will receive at least six dollars per day and get reimbursed for mileage traveling to and from court. The bill also allows counties or cities to pay jurors additional money, and the state will help cover part of these extra costs. These updates aim to make juror compensation clearer and may affect local governments, jurors, and the judicial system across Missouri.
