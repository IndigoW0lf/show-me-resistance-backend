summary_short: "Allows Missouri law enforcement leaders to request help from other jurisdictions, even outside the state."
summary: |
  This bill lets the chief law enforcement officer in any Missouri area ask for assistance from law enforcement agencies in other parts of the United States. If an officer makes an arrest outside their usual area, the person they arrest will be handed over to officers in the jurisdiction where the crime happened. The law ensures that officers remain employees of their original agencies during and after the assistance and that they are protected by immunity rules. It also clarifies that existing mutual aid agreements and certain laws still apply. This bill mainly affects law enforcement agencies and officers across Missouri and elsewhere in the U.S. when they work together to fight crime.
