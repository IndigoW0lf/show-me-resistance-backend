summary_short: "This bill proposes a new constitutional rule in Missouri that restricts abortion to cases of medical emergency only and sets penalties for violations."

summary: |
  The bill aims to change Missouri's Constitution to limit abortion access. It states that abortion can only be performed in medical emergencies where a woman's life or health is at serious risk. The bill defines abortion very broadly, including any means used to destroy an embryo or fetus. It also creates penalties for doctors who perform abortions outside of these emergency cases and states that no other exceptions can be added unless approved by a vote of the people. Additionally, the bill encourages support for pregnant women and families through potential tax credits for donations to related organizations.
