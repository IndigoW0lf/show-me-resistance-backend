  The bill changes the existing laws about a tax credit that supports bringing sporting events to Missouri. It defines key terms like "active members" (sports organizations), "certified sponsors," and "endorsing municipalities." The bill clarifies how donations from taxpayers can be used to promote sports events, but it excludes costs for building or renovating facilities. Overall, it aims to make the process clearer and more focused on attracting sporting events through tax incentives, impacting sports organizations, local governments, and taxpayers who donate.
