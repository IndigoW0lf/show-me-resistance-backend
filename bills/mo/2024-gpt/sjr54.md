summary_short: "This bill removes the ban on former legislative staff becoming lobbyists until two years after they leave their jobs in Missouri."
summary: |
  This legislation proposes that, starting after December 6, 2018, former members or employees of Missouri's general assembly can serve as lobbyists, but only after a two-year waiting period following their last session. It repeals the previous constitutional restriction that prevented them from acting as paid lobbyists immediately after their legislative service. The bill also confirms that sitting legislators and staff cannot accept gifts or benefits from lobbyists or lobbying groups during their time in office, and it clarifies campaign contribution rules. The intent is to ease restrictions on lobbying careers for former legislators while maintaining conflict-of-interest safeguards during their time in office.
