summary: |
  This legislation revises Missouriâ€™s laws related to drug trafficking offenses. It defines specific amounts of various illegal substances, such as heroin, cocaine, marijuana, and synthetic drugs, that would classify someone as a first-degree trafficking offender. The bill increases the severity of penalties, making some trafficking offenses a Class A felony if the quantities involved are very large. These changes aim to better target large-scale drug traffickers and enhance law enforcement capabilities to combat drug crime.
