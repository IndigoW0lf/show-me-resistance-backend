summary: |
  This bill proposes amending the Missouri Constitution to affirm that citizens have an unalienable right to keep and bear arms, including ammunition and accessories, for self-defense and other lawful purposes. It states that any restrictions on these rights must be carefully reviewed and that the state must protect against violations of gun rights. The bill also allows cities like St. Louis and Kansas City to pass laws regulating firearms within their limits, including issuing permits, setting fees, and establishing penalties, while recognizing valid permits from other locations and exemptions for certain professionals like law enforcement and military personnel.
