summary: |
  This bill updates Missouri's rules for electric utilities by establishing specific targets for renewable energy use. Starting from 2011, utilities must generate or purchase increasing amounts of electricity from renewable sources, reaching at least 15% annually by 2021. At least 2% of this renewable energy must come from solar power. The bill also creates a program for large energy users (those with over 80 megawatts of load) to buy renewable energy certificates from new solar or wind projects, retire these certificates, and count them toward renewable standards without extra costs. Overall, the bill encourages more renewable energy development and aims to make the state's electricity cleaner while involving bigger energy consumers in the process.
