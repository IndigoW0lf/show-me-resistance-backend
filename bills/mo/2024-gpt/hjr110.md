summary: |
  This bill suggests changing Missouri’s constitution to require all counties to elect a sheriff for a four-year term, unless a county currently does not have an elected sheriff. It specifies the sheriff’s responsibilities, such as enforcing laws, handling riots, and attending court sessions. The bill also allows voters to potentially recall a sheriff after at least six months in office, following a set procedure. Overall, it affects how sheriffs are chosen and what powers they hold across different counties in Missouri.
