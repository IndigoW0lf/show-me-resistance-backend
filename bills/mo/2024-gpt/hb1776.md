summary: |
  This bill, called the "Telecommunications Security Act of 2024," sets rules to ensure that Missouri's important telecommunications infrastructure is secure. It prohibits the use of equipment built by companies that are banned at the federal level or by foreign adversaries like China or Russia. This means that any physical infrastructure supporting internet or phone communications within the state cannot include products from these banned companies or countries. The goal is to strengthen cybersecurity and protect against potential threats from foreign adversaries or companies that pose a national security risk.
