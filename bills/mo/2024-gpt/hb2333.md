summary_short: "The bill changes how delinquent property taxes are collected, stopping foreclosure of principal residences and allowing alternative methods."
summary: |
  This bill updates the laws about collecting unpaid property taxes. It states that if the property is a homeownerâ€™s main residence, that home cannot be foreclosed on for unpaid taxes. Instead, the government can use other legal methods to collect the owed taxes. The bill also allows local districts to set special assessments on properties to fund community projects, with clear rules on how those assessments are decided and applied. These changes are meant to make tax collection fairer and provide alternative options for governments to recover unpaid taxes.
