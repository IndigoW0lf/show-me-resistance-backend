summary: |
  The bill revises the process for obtaining Missouri Conservation Heritage Foundation license plates. Vehicle owners can now apply annually for a special emblem-use authorization by paying a $25 fee, which allows them to get license plates with the foundationâ€™s emblem. This process can be completed when registering their vehicle, and the fee collected goes directly to support conservation efforts. If a vehicle owner does not provide the authorization, they will receive a standard license plate without the emblem. The bill aims to make it easier for residents to support conservation projects through their vehicle registration and clarifies rules for administering these specialty plates.
