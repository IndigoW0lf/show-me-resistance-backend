summary: |
  The bill changes Missouriâ€™s rules for teaching civics and American history in schools. It requires public and private schools to include lessons about the U.S. and Missouri governments, history, and elections, starting no later than sixth grade by 2025. Students must take at least one semester of civics classes before graduating high school, with specific focus on the history of racial equality movements. To get a diploma, students must pass an exam on the Constitution, American history, and civics, unless they meet certain transfer requirements. The law affects students, teachers, and school districts across Missouri by setting new standards for civics education and assessment.
