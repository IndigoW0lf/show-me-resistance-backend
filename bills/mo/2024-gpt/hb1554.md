summary: |
  This bill makes sure that when money is spent on developing Rock Island Trail State Park, at least 10% of those funds are used to address concerns from nearby landowners. These concerns include things like fences, crossings, drainage, signage, safety, and security. The goal is to support both the park's development and the needs of landowners living near the trail. It affects the Department of Natural Resources, which manages the park's projects, as well as landowners in the area.
