summary_short: "This bill gradually eliminates the corporate income tax in Missouri, ending all such taxes by 2029."
summary: |
  The bill changes the way Missouri taxes corporations' income. It reduces the corporate income tax rate from 6.25% to 4% starting in 2020. Then, over several years, the rate is gradually cut by small amounts each year and will be completely eliminated by 2029. This means that large businesses operating in Missouri will pay less in taxes on their income over time, and after 2028, they will no longer owe corporate income tax. The bill applies only to in-state businesses and does not affect out-of-state companies operating within Missouri.
