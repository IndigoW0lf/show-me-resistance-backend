summary: |
  This bill establishes the Teacher Recruitment and Retention State Scholarship Program in Missouri. It provides scholarships to eligible students who plan to pursue a teaching degree at a Missouri college or university. The goal is to encourage students to become teachers in areas that need more staff by offering financial support for tuition and related costs. Recipients must commit to teaching in Missouri public schools, especially those with high-risk or hard-to-staff student populations, for at least two years after receiving the scholarship. The program aims to attract and retain teachers in underserved areas over multiple years, with increasing scholarship availability each year.
