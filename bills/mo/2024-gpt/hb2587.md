summary: |
  This bill updates Missouri's income tax laws by setting new tax rates for residents based on their income levels. It sets the top tax rate at 4.95% beginning in 2023, with the possibility of further small reductions in 2024 if state revenue grows significantly. The bill also removes older rules that previously triggered additional tax rate reductions. These changes affect all Missouri residents with taxable income, especially higher earners, and are designed to adjust how much income tax residents pay while allowing for potential future reductions based on state revenue performance.
