summary_short: "Long-term care facilities in Missouri must carry liability insurance or maintain a reserve fund to cover certain losses."
summary: |
  This bill requires all long-term care facilities in Missouri to have liability insurance of at least two million dollars or, alternatively, to keep a reserve account with at least two million dollars to cover costs from neglect, abuse, or wrongful death involving residents. This aims to ensure that facilities have financial resources available to pay for damages if something goes wrong. The law helps protect residents by making sure long-term care facilities are financially prepared to handle potential incidents and hold facilities accountable. It affects facility operators, residents, and their families by setting clear financial requirements for operation.
