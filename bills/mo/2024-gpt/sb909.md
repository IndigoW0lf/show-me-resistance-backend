summary_short: "This law stops government funding from going to health care facilities that refuse treatment based on a person's COVID-19 vaccination status."

summary: |
  This bill makes it illegal for health care facilities that receive public money to refuse to treat someone just because of their COVID-19 vaccination status. If a health care provider denies services for this reason, they will lose access to public funds, which are financial resources provided by the government. The goal is to ensure that everyone can get medical care regardless of whether they are vaccinated. This change affects public health facilities that rely on government funding and aims to prevent discrimination based on COVID-19 vaccination status.
