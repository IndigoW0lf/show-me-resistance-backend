summary: |
  This bill requires the Missouri Department of Natural Resources to investigate when there's a complaint about someone releasing harmful substances into public water systems or drinking water sources. If the department finds that a contaminant poses a health risk or requires system changes, it can take legal action to recover costs and damages from the person responsible. The law also makes sure that if a public utility is blamed, they cannot pass the costs onto their customers. Overall, the bill aims to protect public health and ensure accountability for water contamination incidents.
