summary_short: "This bill adds the death penalty as a possible punishment for certain severe sex crimes involving children in Missouri."
summary: |
  This bill changes Missouri law to specify that the death penalty can be used in cases of first-degree statutory rape or sexual trafficking of a child. It explains how trials will be conducted if the death penalty is involved, including a two-stage trial process where guilt is decided first, then punishment. If the defendant is found guilty of these serious crimes, the judge or jury can decide to sentence them to life in prison without parole, or, with certain conditions, to the death penalty. The law affects defendants accused of these crimes and the legal process surrounding such cases in Missouri.
