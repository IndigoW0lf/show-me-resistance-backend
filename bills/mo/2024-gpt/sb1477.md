summary: |
  The bill authorizes the governor of Missouri to sell or transfer an easement — a legal right to use land — on a specific piece of state-owned property in Laclede County to the City of Lebanon. The easement covers a 40-foot-wide strip of land described in detail by property boundaries. The purpose of this transfer is typically to support infrastructure, road access, or public use. The commissioner of administration will set the terms for this transfer, such as how the land is appraised and the conditions of the sale. The attorney general will review and approve the legal paperwork for this transaction. This bill mainly impacts the state government, the City of Lebanon, and property owners in that area by enabling the transfer of land rights to support local development or city projects.
