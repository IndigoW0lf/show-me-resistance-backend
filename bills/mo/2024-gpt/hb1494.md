summary_short: "This law creates rules to help parents and caregivers stay connected with their children when a parent is deployed for military service."
summary: |
  This bill, called the "Uniform Deployed Parents Custody and Visitation Act," sets up clear guidelines for how custody and visitation should be handled when a parent in the military is deployed. It defines key terms like "deploying parent," "custodial responsibility," and "limited contact," making sure everyone understands their rights and responsibilities. The law aims to protect the relationship between children and both parents or guardians during deployment, ensuring that non-deploying parents, family members, and caregivers can maintain contact with the child. It applies to situations where a parent is away for more than ninety days but less than eighteen months, helping reduce conflicts and provide stability for the child's care.
