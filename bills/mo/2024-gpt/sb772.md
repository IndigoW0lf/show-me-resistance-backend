summary_short: "This bill changes how fees are collected for vehicle and driver licenses and who can handle these transactions for the Missouri Department of Revenue."

summary: |
  The bill updates rules for people and organizations that process vehicle registrations, titles, and licenses on behalf of the Missouri Department of Revenue. It sets the specific fees they can charge for services like registering a vehicle, transferring titles, and issuing driver licenses. It also requires these organizations to compete in a bidding process for contracts, giving priority to nonprofits and groups that reinvest most of their earnings into community charities or local governments. The changes aim to improve transparency and fairness in how license-related services are managed and paid for in Missouri.
