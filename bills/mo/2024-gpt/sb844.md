summary_short: "All payments made on behalf of a health plan enrollee for medications without generic options count toward their out-of-pocket costs."
  
summary: |
  This bill makes sure that any amount paid for medications—whether paid by the enrollee or on their behalf—that do not have a generic equivalent will be counted toward their out-of-pocket maximum and other cost-sharing requirements. This means that these payments will help limit how much the enrollee has to pay out of their own pocket for their healthcare. The rule applies to most health plans and pharmacy benefits, and it also considers special rules for high deductible health plans tied to health savings accounts. The bill ensures the total costs paid by enrollees are accurately counted, making it clearer how much they owe for their health care services while allowing health plans to continue using step therapy protocols.
