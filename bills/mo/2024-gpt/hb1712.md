summary: |
  The bill changes the rules so that members of the Missouri National Guard can now receive educational assistance grants to attend not only Missouri schools but also out-of-state institutions. This means that Guard members can use their grants for tuition at colleges and universities outside Missouri, as long as they meet certain requirements. It ensures they can access educational funds for a wider range of schools to support their learning while serving in the Guard. The bill helps Guard members pursue higher education more flexibly, whether they choose in-state or out-of-state schools.
