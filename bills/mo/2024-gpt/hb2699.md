summary_short: "This bill removes the ability to suspend professional licenses for unpaid taxes or unfiled tax returns in Missouri."

summary: |
  The bill repeals existing laws that allowed the state to suspend professional licenses if a person didn't pay their taxes or failed to file tax returns. Instead, it sets up a new system for managing professional licenses through the Division of Professional Registration, which is part of the Department of Commerce and Insurance. The changes mean that professionals such as healthcare workers, lawyers, and others will not have their licenses suspended for unpaid taxes. The goal is to make license renewal and management clearer and to prevent license suspension due to tax issues.
