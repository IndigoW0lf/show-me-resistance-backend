summary_short: "This bill updates the rules for a tax credit that helps fund the redevelopment of certain properties in Missouri."
summary: |
  The bill replaces existing laws with new rules for a tax credit called the "Distressed Areas Land Assemblage Tax Credit." This tax credit supports projects that buy and prepare land in certain areas for redevelopment, especially in distressed or urban renewal zones. It defines who can apply, what costs qualify for the credit, and how the program is meant to encourage redevelopment through cooperation with local authorities. The bill mainly affects property developers working within municipal redevelopment plans and aims to promote revitalization in troubled areas.
