summary_short: "This bill updates Missouri's rules for issuing permits to operate and build solid waste disposal facilities."

summary: |
  The bill changes the laws regarding permits for managing solid waste in Missouri. It requires anyone who wants to build or run a waste processing or disposal site to first get a construction and an operating permit from the Department of Natural Resources. Existing facilities as of August 28, 1995, are considered authorized to operate, but new permits wonâ€™t be issued for landfills in flood-prone areas. The bill also introduces new steps for review, including preliminary site investigations and public involvement activities to keep communities informed and involved in the permitting process.
