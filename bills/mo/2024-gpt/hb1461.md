summary: |
  This bill changes the rules about unlawfully possessing a firearm in Missouri. It makes it a crime for someone to carry a firearm if they have been convicted of specific serious crimes, are fugitives, or have court orders preventing them from threatening or harming others. The law also increases penalties for illegal possession, making it a class D felony generally, or a class C felony if the person has a prior dangerous felony conviction. The bill is designed to better protect victims of domestic violence and the public by clarifying who is illegal to possess guns and imposing stricter consequences for violations.
