summary_short: "This bill creates a tax credit to help families pay for certain educational expenses for private or home-schooled students in Missouri."
summary: |
  This bill allows Missouri taxpayers to claim a tax credit starting in 2025 for expenses related to educating a qualified student at a private school or home school. Eligible expenses include tuition, textbooks, tutoring, educational therapies, curriculum, testing, and transportation costs. The tax credit can cover up to 100% of these qualified expenses, but it cannot exceed the state's funding target for education. If the credit is more than the taxpayer owes in taxes, they will get a refund for the extra amount. This bill mainly helps families who choose private or home-based education for their children by providing financial relief through a tax credit.
