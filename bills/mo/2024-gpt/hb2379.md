summary_short: "Allows voters to use more types of photo ID when voting in Missouri."

summary: |
  This bill changes the rules for voter ID in Missouri, making it easier for people to use different forms of photo identification when voting. Voters can now show a Missouri driver's license, a student ID from a Missouri school or college, or certain documents that include a photo and meet specific criteria. If someone doesn't have acceptable ID, they can still vote by casting a provisional ballot, which is reviewed later to confirm eligibility. The goal is to ensure more people can prove who they are and safely cast their vote, while maintaining election security.
