summary: |
  This bill sets a rule that students between 16 and 17 years old who attend high school and work full-time cannot be forced or allowed to work after 10:00 p.m. on nights before a school day. The goal is to help students balance work and school by ensuring they don’t stay out late on school nights. There are some exceptions, such as if the student is working under their parent’s control, homeschooled, earning credit during school, or participating in sports or entertainment. The provision can be waived in special cases by the director of the department of labor and industrial relations. This bill mainly affects working high school students and their employers in Missouri.
