summary: |
  The "Light Detection & Ranging Technology Security Act of 2024" aims to enhance security around sensitive systems in Missouri by controlling the use of LIDAR technology. It specifically targets devices that use laser-based sensing, such as those in autonomous vehicles, drones, and security systems at airports or other critical sites. The bill designates certain countries, including China, Russia, Iran, North Korea, Cuba, Venezuela, and Syria, as "countries of concern" and may restrict technology from these nations if it poses a security risk. Overall, it affects companies, government agencies, and organizations involved in deploying or operating LIDAR and autonomous tech within the state, especially in vital infrastructure or security-critical areas.
