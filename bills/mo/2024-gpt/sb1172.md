summary: |
  This bill creates new rules for electric vehicle charging stations in Missouri. It states that if local governments want to require the installation of these stations, they must pay all costs involved, including setup and maintenance. The bill limits the number of charging stations in a parking lot to five and only applies these rules to parking lots with more than 30 spaces. It also prevents schools and religious organizations from being required to install such stations and allows business or property owners to choose to pay for and install stations if they want. The goal is to promote electric vehicle use while limiting the financial and logistical burden on local governments and certain organizations.
