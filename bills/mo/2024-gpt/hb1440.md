summary_short: "This bill allows schools to designate certain staff as school protection officers who can carry concealed firearms and defend against threats."
summary: |
  The bill updates laws to let school districts choose teachers, administrators, or other staff to be sworn-in as school protection officers. These officers can carry concealed firearms or nonlethal self-defense sprays on campus and have the authority to detain or use force against people causing trouble. They do this voluntarily, and their extra duties are paid for by local schools, not the state. The law also sets rules for how these officers should handle detained individuals, ensuring quick handover to law enforcement or school officials. Overall, it affects school staff, students, and law enforcement by creating new security roles within schools.
