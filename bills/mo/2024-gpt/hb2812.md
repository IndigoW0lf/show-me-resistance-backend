summary_short: "This bill updates the rules for how many hours and days Missouri schools must stay open each year."
summary: |
  The bill makes changes to the existing laws about the minimum length of the school year for Missouri public schools. Instead of a fixed number of days, it now requires schools to have at least 1,044 hours of student attendance during the school year. Schools with a four-day week or located in certain areas could still be required to meet specific day counts, but overall, the focus is on hours rather than days. This affects school districts, students, parents, and school administrators by setting new standards for when schools must operate each year.
