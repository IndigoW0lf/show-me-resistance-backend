summary_short: "This bill changes how personal property taxes are assessed and reduced over time in Missouri, with the goal of maintaining revenue levels."
summary: |
  The bill updates Missouri laws related to personal property taxes by establishing a new method for assessing personal property (like business equipment and other tangible items) at a reduced percentage of their value each year. Starting in 2025, the assessment percentage will decrease annually until 2073, aiming to keep property tax revenue steady relative to growth in real estate values. This means personal property taxes will generally be assessed at a lower proportion of their true value over time, which could result in lower tax bills for such property owners. The bill also includes provisions to reimburse local governments if their tax revenues fall below certain levels due to these changes. It primarily impacts property owners, local governments, and assessors across Missouri.
