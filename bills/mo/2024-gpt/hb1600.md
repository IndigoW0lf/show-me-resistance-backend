summary_short: "This bill aims to improve maternal and infant care by requiring reports on infant deaths, establishing review committees, and promoting strategies to reduce infant mortality."
summary: |
  This bill creates new rules for tracking and preventing infant deaths in Missouri. It requires counties to report data on infant deaths annually and to disaggregate the data by race and ethnicity. If a county has multiple infant deaths or a higher death rate than the state for two years, it must set up a committee to review those deaths and find ways to improve outcomes. The bill also establishes a statewide process to review infant deaths voluntarily, focusing on term infants and involving community members, but it keeps sensitive data confidential. These measures are meant to help local health agencies understand and address factors that affect infant health, ultimately aiming to reduce infant mortality.
