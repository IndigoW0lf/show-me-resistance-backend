summary: |
  This bill changes the rules for transferring real estate in Missouri. It requires that a "certificate of value" be filed whenever someone transfers ownership of property, showing details like the property's use and the full consideration paid. The certificate must be delivered to the recorder of deeds before the transfer can be recorded, with certain exceptions. This process helps ensure accurate property and tax records and affects buyers, sellers, real estate agents, attorneys, and government officials involved in property transactions.
