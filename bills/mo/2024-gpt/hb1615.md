summary_short: "This bill changes the rules for qualifying students receiving Missouri empowerment scholarship accounts, focusing on student eligibility criteria."
summary: |
  The bill updates the definition of "qualified student" for Missouri's empowerment scholarship program. It specifies that students who have an Individualized Education Plan (IEP) or come from low-income households are eligible for scholarships. This affects students with special needs and those from families with limited income, making it easier for them to access alternative education options like private, charter, or virtual schools. The aim is to broaden opportunities for these students to participate in the scholarship program.
