summary: |
  The bill revamps the list of income sources that are exempt from earning tax in Missouri. It specifies that certain organizations and types of income, such as those from religious groups, charities, mutual insurance companies, and federal land banks, will not be taxed. This affects businesses, nonprofit organizations, and groups operating for public or mutual benefit by clarifying which income remains tax-free. The goal is to provide clear rules for tax exemptions and support organizations serving community, religious, charitable, and agricultural purposes.
