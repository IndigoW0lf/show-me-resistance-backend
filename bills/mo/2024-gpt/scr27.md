summary_short: "Missouri will observe February 24 as 'SCN2A Awareness Day' to raise understanding of genetic disorders caused by the SCN2A gene."
summary: |
  This bill officially designates February 24 each year as "SCN2A Awareness Day" in Missouri. It aims to increase awareness about disorders related to mutations in the SCN2A gene, which can cause a range of neurodevelopmental conditions such as autism, seizures, and intellectual disabilities. The bill encourages residents to participate in activities and wear specific colors to promote understanding and support for affected individuals. While these disorders can often be diagnosed with DNA testing, many go unnoticed because people and even doctors may not be aware of them. The goal is to improve knowledge, support research, and help develop better treatments for those affected.
