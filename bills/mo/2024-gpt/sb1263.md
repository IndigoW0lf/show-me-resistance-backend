summary_short: "This bill updates how funds are allocated for port and waterway projects in Missouri, setting new rules for a specialized trust fund."
summary: |
  The bill creates a new Waterways and Ports Trust Fund in Missouri's state treasury, which will be used to support improvement projects for ports and waterways. It clarifies who can receive money from this fundâ€”mainly projects that enhance transportation and commerce on navigable rivers, located on land owned or leased by port authorities or cities, and that are cost-effective and feasible to complete within two years. Only projects approved by the state's transportation commission and funded by other sources up to 80% can benefit from this fund. The bill also states that the fund will exist until August 28, 2033, and any remaining money will be transferred to the state's general revenue after the fund is dissolved. It mainly affects port authorities, transportation agencies, and organizations involved in water-based commerce projects.
