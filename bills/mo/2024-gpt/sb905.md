summary_short: "This bill changes the rules about how people with certain drug-related convictions can qualify for food assistance programs in Missouri."

summary: |
  This bill updates Missouri laws to provide more opportunities for people with past felony drug convictions to receive food stamp benefits. It sets conditions under which these individuals can be exempt from federal restrictions if they are participating in or have completed approved substance abuse treatment, are complying with court requirements, and demonstrate sobriety. The bill also specifies that individuals who commit new drug-related offenses within a year of their first conviction may lose this exemption. It aims to support recovery and reintegration while ensuring proper oversight.
