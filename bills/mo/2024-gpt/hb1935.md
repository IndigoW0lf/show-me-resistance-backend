summary: |
  This bill, called the "Revitalizing Missouri Downtowns and Main Streets Act," offers tax credits to people and businesses that invest in converting old, nonresidential buildings into residential, retail, or other commercial uses, especially in historic downtown areas. The goal is to encourage development and renewal of older districts by providing financial incentives through tax credits. The credits apply to qualified renovation expenses and are available for projects in specific areas called Missouri main street districts. This affects property owners, developers, and investors involved in downtown revitalization, helping to make these areas more vibrant and economically healthy.
