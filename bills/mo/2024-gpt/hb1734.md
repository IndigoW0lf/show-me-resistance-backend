summary: |
  This legislation updates rules for community water systems to ensure better maintenance and safety. It requires these systems to inspect all valves every ten years and to repair or replace broken valves. Hydrants must be tested regularly, and their locations must be accurately mapped within five years. The plan aims to improve water safety and system management, but it does not apply to certain large cities, state parks, and some utilities regulated by public service commissions.
