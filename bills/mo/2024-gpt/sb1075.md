summary_short: "This bill updates Missouri's rules for transferring lower-division college courses to improve consistency and credit transfer between public colleges and universities."

summary: |
  The bill modifies existing laws to create a clearer and more consistent system for transferring lower-level college courses across Missouri's public colleges and universities. It requires the state's higher education board to develop a standard core curriculum of 60 semester credit hours, including specific courses that can be transferred between institutions. If a student completes this core curriculum at one public college or university, they can transfer those credits to another public institution without needing to retake similar courses, making it easier to move between schools and complete degrees. The bill aims to help students save time and money by promoting easier credit transfer across the state's public higher education system.
