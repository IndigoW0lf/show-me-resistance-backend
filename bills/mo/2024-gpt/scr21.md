summary: |
  This bill officially establishes the fourth Wednesday of February each year as Hypertrophic Cardiomyopathy Awareness Day in Missouri. Hypertrophic cardiomyopathy (HCM) is a genetic heart condition that can cause the heart muscle to thicken, leading to serious health problems like heart failure, stroke, or even sudden death. Many people with HCM do not know they have it because its symptoms can be similar to other common illnesses. The day aims to raise awareness, encourage people to learn about the disease, and promote early diagnosis and treatment options to improve health outcomes.
