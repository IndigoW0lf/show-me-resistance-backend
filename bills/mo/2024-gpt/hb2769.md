summary: |
  This law creates a new crime in Missouri called "trafficking a child sex doll." It applies to anyone who knowingly buys, possesses, sells, or distributes a doll that looks like a minor and is used for sexual purposes. The bill treats the first offense as a serious crime (a Class E felony), and any additional offenses as more severe (a Class D felony). It aims to prevent the creation and distribution of such dolls, which can promote harmful behavior toward minors.
