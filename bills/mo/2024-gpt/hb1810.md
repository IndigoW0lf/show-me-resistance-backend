summary: |
  This bill establishes a new "Matching Grants for Teachers Plan" in Missouri, which provides financial support to school districts that use their reserve funds to increase teacher salaries. The state will set up a special fund to hold appropriated money, which can earn interest over time. School districts can apply for matching grants to cover the amount they spend from their reserves on higher teacher pay, but no district can receive more than one million dollars each year. The funds are intended to incentivize districts to prioritize teacher salaries without depleting their reserves below legal or necessary levels. This program is designed to help improve teacher compensation across the state while ensuring responsible use of district funds.
