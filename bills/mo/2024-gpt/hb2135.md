summary_short: "This bill updates workers' compensation laws in Missouri, especially regarding injuries related to drug and alcohol use, including marijuana, and how employer violations or employee misconduct affect benefits."
summary: |
  This legislation changes Missouri's workers' compensation rules by clarifying when and how employees can receive benefits after a work-related injury or death. It specifies that employers must provide compensation regardless of fault, except if the injury was intentionally self-inflicted or caused by the employee's illegal drug or alcohol use, including marijuana. If an employer fails to follow safety laws or rules, their obligation to pay benefits increases by 15%. Conversely, if an employee ignores safety rules or knowingly uses drugs or alcohol, their benefits can be reduced by at least 25%. The bill also addresses injuries caused by unprovoked violence or assaults at work. Overall, it aims to balance protections for workers with holding employees accountable for misconduct related to drug or alcohol use.
