summary_short: "This bill urges Congress to grant statehood to Washington, D.C., giving its residents full representation in Congress."

summary: |
  This bill supports making Washington, D.C. a state so that its residents can have full voting rights and representation in Congress, just like residents of the 50 states. Currently, D.C. residents cannot elect voting members of Congress, despite paying federal taxes, serving on juries, and defending the country. The bill highlights that D.C. residents have widely supported statehood, and it calls on Congress to pass laws to make D.C. a state, providing its people with the same rights as other U.S. citizens. This change would give D.C. residents the ability to elect Senators and Representatives and have a greater say in national government decisions.
