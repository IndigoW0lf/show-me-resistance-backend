summary_short: "This bill changes Missouriâ€™s voting rules and prevents foreign governments from influencing elections."

summary: |
  This bill proposes a new amendment to the Missouri Constitution that clarifies who can vote and strengthens protections against foreign interference in elections. It states that only U.S. citizens who are 18 or older, residents of the state and their local area, and who meet registration or residency requirements can vote. It also restricts voting rights for people with certain mental health restrictions, and for those convicted of felonies. Additionally, the bill bans foreign governments and foreign political parties from donating money, making promises, or spending money to influence Missouri elections, and from funding initiatives or referendums. These changes are meant to ensure fair voting practices and safeguard the state's elections from foreign interference.
