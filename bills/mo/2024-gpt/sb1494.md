summary_short: "This law aims to prevent unnecessary hospital stays by ensuring children and adults are placed in proper settings and receive appropriate care instead of being kept in hospitals without medical reason."

summary: |
  The End Hospital Institutionalization Act sets new rules to stop people, including children, from being kept in hospitals longer than needed when they are medically stable. If hospitals find that children under juvenile court jurisdiction or individuals with developmental disabilities or mental health issues are being kept in the hospital without a medical reason, the law requires courts or mental health agencies to step in quickly. For children under juvenile court, the court must make sure they are moved to a proper, safe place and given the right treatment. For other individuals with mental health or developmental needs, the Department of Mental Health will coordinate appropriate care, including residential or inpatient treatment, in the least restrictive environment. The law also ensures hospitals are reimbursed for the costs of these stays, helping reduce unnecessary hospitalization and promote proper treatment placement.
