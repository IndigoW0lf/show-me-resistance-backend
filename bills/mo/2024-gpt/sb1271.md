summary: |
  This legislation creates new rules for handling informants in criminal cases in Missouri. It requires prosecutors to keep a centralized, searchable record of cases involving informants, including details about their testimony and any benefits offered or received. Prosecutors must also share certain information monthly with a statewide database, and they are required to disclose specific details about informants—such as their criminal history and cooperation agreements—within two weeks of endorsing them as witnesses. These changes aim to improve transparency and accountability in cases involving informants, affecting law enforcement, prosecutors, defense attorneys, and the justice system as a whole.
