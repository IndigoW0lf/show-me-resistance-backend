summary: |
  This bill makes changes to Missouri's tax laws regarding pass-through entities such as S corporations, partnerships, and trusts. It allows residents and shareholders to receive credit for income taxes paid to other states on income that also gets taxed in Missouri. The bill clarifies how these credits are calculated, especially when multiple states tax the same income, and ensures that shareholders of S corporations that operate in other states can reduce their Missouri taxes accordingly. It affects taxpayers, business owners, and the state revenue system by providing clearer rules for avoiding double taxation on income earned across multiple states.
