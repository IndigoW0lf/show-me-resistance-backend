summary: |
  This bill mandates that any railroad train or light engine used for freight transportation in Missouri must have at least two qualified crew members on board. It excludes helper services, hostler services, and trains moving no more than ten miles per hour for loading or unloading. If a railroad company fails to comply, individuals who break this rule can face fines and misdemeanor charges, increasing with repeated offenses. The goal is to improve safety and accountability in freight rail operations across the state.
