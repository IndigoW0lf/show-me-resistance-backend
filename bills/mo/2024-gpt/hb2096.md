  This bill updates Missouri's vehicle registration rules to provide a new option for registering motor vehicles that are less than five years old.

The bill also revises license plate regulations, including design and special plates for disabled veterans and National Guard members. It affects vehicle owners, dealerships, and the stateâ€™s revenue department by changing how vehicle registrations are issued and managed.
