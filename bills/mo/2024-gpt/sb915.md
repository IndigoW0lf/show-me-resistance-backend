summary_short: "This bill allows certain senior citizens and disabled individuals in Missouri to defer paying their property taxes on their homes."

summary: |
  The bill gives eligible seniors aged 59 1/2 or older, and disabled individuals, the option to delay paying their property taxes on their primary residence. Homeowners can apply to defer their taxes, which will be paid later, helping those with limited income or health issues manage their finances. The program applies to qualifying properties that have been owned and occupied by the homeowner for at least five years, and it aims to make homeownership more affordable for seniors and disabled residents.
