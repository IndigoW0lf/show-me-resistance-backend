summary: |
  The bill changes the laws around telemedicine in Missouri to make sure doctors follow clear steps before giving treatment or medication remotely. It requires doctors to have a proper doctor-patient relationship established, either through an in-person visit, consultation with another doctor who knows the patient, or a telemedicine session that meets certain standards. Before prescribing drugs or treatment via telehealth, doctors must review the patient's medical history, perform an adequate exam, and keep accurate records. These rules aim to protect patients by ensuring their care is thorough, whether received in person or remotely.
