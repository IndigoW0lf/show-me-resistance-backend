summary_short: "This bill changes how radioactive waste investigations are funded and managed in Missouri."
summary: |
  The bill creates a dedicated Radioactive Waste Investigation Fund in the state treasury, which is used to fund investigations into radioactive waste concerns in local areas. Local governments can request investigations if they suspect contamination, and the Department of Natural Resources will handle these cases by working with federal or state agencies or contractors. The investigations include collecting soil, dust, and water samples to determine if radioactive contaminants exceed federal safety standards. The bill limits the funding transferred from the hazardous waste fund to a maximum of $300,000 per year and ensures that any interest earned on the fund is reinvested. This legislation aims to improve radioactive waste oversight and protect public health by making investigations more systematic and better funded.
