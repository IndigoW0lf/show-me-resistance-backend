summary_short: "This bill limits when and how damages are recovered from defendants and insurers in civil cases, preventing double recovery and clarifying payment rules."

summary: |
  This law changes the rules about how damages are paid and shared in civil lawsuits. If a defendant or their insurance company pays some of a plaintiff's damages before trial, that amount can’t be claimed again from the defendant. Additionally, if an insurer reimburses part of a plaintiff’s deductible or damages before a lawsuit is filed, the plaintiff cannot receive those same damages twice. The bill also allows defendants to get credits for payments made that reduce the amount they owe, and it clarifies how the actual cost of medical care can be proven in court. Overall, it aims to prevent double recovery and make the process clearer for both plaintiffs and defendants.
