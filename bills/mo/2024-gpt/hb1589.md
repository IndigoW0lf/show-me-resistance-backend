summary: |
  The bill updates state laws to better protect sports officials such as referees and umpires by ensuring they cannot be held civilly responsible for injuries or damages resulting from their officiating duties, except in cases of intentional, reckless, or malicious actions. Additionally, it broadens the definition of a "special victim" to include sports officials who are assaulted while performing their official duties. These changes aim to give sports officials legal protection and clarify who is considered a victim of violence or assault in sporting events, impacting officials, sports organizations, and event organizers.
