summary_short: "Employers cannot fire employees just for having a locked firearm in their vehicle on company property."
summary: |
  This bill prevents employers in Missouri from terminating employees solely because they have a firearm stored in their locked vehicle while on company property. It applies when employees are arriving, leaving, or working within the scope of their job. The firearm must be kept out of sight, stored securely in a locked vehicle, and the employee must be legally allowed to possess it. Employers are not liable for any injuries or damages caused by firearms stored in compliance with these rules. This law offers protection to employees who responsibly keep their firearms in their personal vehicles on work grounds.
