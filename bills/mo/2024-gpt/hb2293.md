summary_short: "This bill sets rules for how the state manages unaccredited school districts, including establishing special administrative boards when needed."
summary: |
  The bill requires the Missouri Department of Education to review and monitor school districts that are unaccredited or fail to meet minimum school year requirements. When a district loses accreditation, the state can decide to let the current school board continue or appoint a special administrative board to run all or part of the district. These administrative boards will have at least five members who are residents of the district and have experience in school management. The purpose is to improve oversight, help districts return to accreditation, or manage districts that need restructuring.
