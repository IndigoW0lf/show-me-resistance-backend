summary: |
  This bill clarifies the rules around when a parent no longer has to pay child support for their child. It generally ends when the child turns 18 or graduates from high school, whichever comes later. However, there are certain cases where support obligations may continue or be adjusted. The bill also explains how parents can request to challenge paternity judgments through genetic testing, and if DNA testing shows they are not the child's biological parent, the court can cancel support and related debts. This affects parents, children, and the courts involved in paternity and support cases.
