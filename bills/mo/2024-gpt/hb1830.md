summary_short: "This bill allows adults in Missouri to use psilocybin for certain mental health and end-of-life reasons under specific conditions and clinical trial participation."
summary: |
  The bill changes Missouri laws to permit adults aged 21 and over to use psilocybin, a psychedelic substance, for specific health conditions like depression, PTSD, substance use disorders, or end-of-life care, if they follow strict rules. It defines what constitutes a genuine doctor-patient relationship and sets out processes for informing health officials, including providing medical documentation and working with licensed professionals. People must also use tested psilocybin and limit their intake, and helping others follow these rules is legally protected. The goal is to allow therapeutic use of psilocybin while ensuring safety and proper oversight.
