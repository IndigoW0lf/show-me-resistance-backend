summary_short: "This bill updates the rules for building electric transmission facilities in Missouri to improve efficiency and oversight."
summary: |
  This legislation changes existing laws to make it easier and clearer for electric utilities to get approval for constructing electric transmission lines, especially those approved by regional transmission organizations. It requires utilities to seek permission from the state's public service commission before starting construction, ensuring public oversight. The bill encourages the use of existing infrastructure and modern design standards but allows the commission to set specific requirements to protect reliability and customer interests. These rules mainly affect electric utilities, regional transmission providers, and state regulators involved in energy infrastructure projects.
