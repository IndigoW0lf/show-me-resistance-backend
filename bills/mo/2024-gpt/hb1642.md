summary: |
  This bill changes the rules about child support when parents have equal time caring for their child. It states that if both parents are awarded the same amount of time with the child, the court cannot order one parent to pay child support for the child's reasonable or necessary expenses. The law also explains when parental support obligations can end, such as when the child turns 18 or 21, gets married, or joins the military, unless certain conditions like disability apply. Overall, it aims to make child support requirements fairer in cases where parents share equally in raising their child.
