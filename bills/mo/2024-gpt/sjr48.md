summary_short: "This bill changes the process for proposing and approving constitutional amendments in Missouri."

summary: |
  This bill updates the rules for how Missouri voters can approve changes to the state constitution. It specifies that proposed amendments must be submitted to voters on a separate ballot during regular or special elections, and each amendment can only address one topic. The bill also clarifies voting requirements, such as needing a majority of votes statewide and in most congressional districts for approval. Additionally, it sets the eligibility to vote on constitutional amendments to legal residents who are U.S. citizens. These changes aim to make the process clearer and more organized for voters and government officials involved in constitutional amendments.
