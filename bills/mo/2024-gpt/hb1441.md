summary_short: "This bill protects sports officials from civil lawsuits related to their officiating duties while clarifying who is considered a 'special victim' under the law."

summary: |
  The bill expands the definition of "special victim" to include sports officials, such as referees and umpires, at sporting events. It also grants these officials civil immunity, meaning they cannot be sued for injuries or damages caused during their officiating, as long as their actions were not intentional, reckless, or grossly negligent. This change helps protect sports officials from legal liability when performing their duties during athletic contests. The bill affects those involved in sports officiating, legal systems, and athletic organizations.
