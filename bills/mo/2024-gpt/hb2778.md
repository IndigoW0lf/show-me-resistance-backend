summary_short: "This bill sets rules for financial institutions about tracking gun purchases and prohibiting the sharing of firearm owner information."
summary: |
  The bill prohibits government agencies and financial institutions from keeping or sharing lists of firearm owners or purchases, except in criminal investigations or as required by law. It also restricts banks and other financial service providers from using special codes related to firearms in a way that singles out Missouri firearm retailers or unfairly affects lawful businesses selling firearms, ammunition, or accessories. The goal is to protect privacy and ensure legal firearm commerce is not unfairly targeted or restricted. This law mainly affects financial institutions, firearm retailers, and government entities in Missouri.
