summary: |
  This bill changes the rules for some county hospitals in Missouri about how they can invest their money. It allows eligible hospitals—specifically those in certain large counties with fewer than 200,000 residents and that receive less than 1% of their income from taxes—to invest up to 15% of their funds in stocks, bonds, and money-market investments. Previously, there might have been more restrictions on how they could handle their money. The goal is to provide these hospitals with more flexibility to grow their funds and better support their operations.
