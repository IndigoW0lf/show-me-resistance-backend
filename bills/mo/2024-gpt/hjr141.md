summary_short: "This proposed constitutional amendment in Missouri aims to affirm and clarify citizens' rights to keep and carry firearms while allowing local governments to regulate firearm possession through ordinances."

summary: |
  This bill proposes amending Missouri's Constitution to explicitly protect the right of all citizens to keep and bear arms, including ammunition and accessories, for defense and law enforcement support. It also sets limits on restrictions, requiring strict scrutiny for any laws that limit gun rights, but allows restrictions for certain convicted violent felons or individuals judged to be a danger due to mental health issues. Additionally, it grants local governments like counties and cities the authority to regulate firearms through ordinances, including issuing permits, applying rules to residents and nonresidents, and setting penalties for violations. This change would impact gun owners, law enforcement, local governments, and residents in Missouri by clarifying rights and regulatory powers related to firearms.
