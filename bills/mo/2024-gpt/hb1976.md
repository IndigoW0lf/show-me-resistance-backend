summary_short: "This bill limits when health insurance companies can require prior approval for medical services and sets rules for transparency and fairness."
summary: |
  This bill makes new rules about how health insurance companies decide if they will approve or deny coverage for medical treatments. It means they can only ask for prior authorization if the providerâ€™s approval rate in the recent six months is below 90%. Insurance companies must notify healthcare providers of their decisions within 25 days and provide clear data on how decisions were made. Providers have the right to appeal decisions, and all prior authorization info must be accessible online. The bill helps ensure that providers are not unfairly denied or delayed for necessary care and promotes transparency in the approval process.
