summary_short: "Students enrolled in the Reserve Officer Training Corps at Missouri public colleges and universities can now qualify for in-state tuition rates."
summary: |
  This bill makes it easier for students enrolled in the Reserve Officer Training Corps (ROTC) at public colleges and universities in Missouri to pay in-state tuition fees. It states that students in the Missouri National Guard, other reserve military components, or ROTC programs will be considered residents of Missouri for tuition purposes. The bill also requires students and institutions to show proof of presence in Missouri and sets rules for how financial aid interacts with tuition. The goal is to support military students and make higher education more accessible to those serving or preparing to serve in the military.
