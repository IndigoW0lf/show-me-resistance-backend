summary: |
  This bill creates and defines the responsibilities of a special advisory committee for the Missouri Department of Revenue. The committee's main job is to develop and decide on uniform designs and colors for state license plates, including options that celebrate Missouriâ€™s bicentennial. It will include members from the Department of Revenue, Highway Patrol, correctional agencies, and legislative leadership, and will hold public meetings to get input on the designs. The committee is tasked with finalizing a design by early 2025 and having new license plates available by 2027. Once they complete their work, the committee will be disbanded.
