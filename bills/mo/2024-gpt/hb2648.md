summary_short: "This bill updates rules about taxes on nonresident entertainers and professional athletes in Missouri."
summary: |
  This bill changes how Missouri handles taxes for entertainers and professional athletes who are not residents of the state. It requires anyone paying these nonresident performers or players to withhold 2% of their compensation if they earn more than $300. The goal is to ensure proper tax collection from these individuals when they perform or participate in events in Missouri. This applies to venues, employers, or any entity paying them, except those that are tax-exempt organizations. The bill affects entertainment venues, sports teams, and payroll administrators by establishing new withholding rules.
