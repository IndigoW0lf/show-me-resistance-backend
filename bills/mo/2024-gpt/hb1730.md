summary: |
  This bill changes the rules for tax credits available to people and businesses who donate money or food to local charities like food pantries, homeless shelters, and soup kitchens in Missouri. It clearly defines what qualifies as a local food pantry, shelter, or soup kitchen that can give donors a tax credit. It extends the date for donations to qualify for these credits and sets limits on how much of the credit can be claimed each year. The bill helps encourage donations by making it more appealing for individuals and companies to contribute to charities that assist low-income and homeless people, while also establishing clear rules and requirements for claiming the credits.
