summary_short: "This bill creates a grant program to encourage healthcare professionals to work and live in rural Missouri counties."
summary: |
  This bill establishes a new program that provides financial incentives to healthcare professionals, like doctors, dentists, nurses, psychiatrists, and chiropractors, who choose to practice and reside in rural counties with fewer than 35,000 residents. Eligible professionals who begin working in these areas after August 28, 2024, can apply for grants of $20,000 per year for five years, as long as they agree to stay in the rural community for the full five-year period. The goal is to attract and keep healthcare providers in underserved rural parts of Missouri, improving access to medical care for residents in these areas.
