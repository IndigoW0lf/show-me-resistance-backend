summary_short: "This proposed constitutional amendment changes how Missouri uses money from gambling, directing most of it to schools and some to veterans' services."

summary: |
  This bill aims to update Missouri's rules for using revenue from gambling activities. Starting in 2026, 90% of the money collected from gambling will go to elementary, secondary, and higher education institutions, helping fund schools and colleges. The remaining 10% will be allocated to the Missouri Veterans Commission to support veterans' programs. Until 2026, all gambling revenue goes entirely to education. This change affects the state's budget and benefits students and veterans by increasing funding sources for both groups.
