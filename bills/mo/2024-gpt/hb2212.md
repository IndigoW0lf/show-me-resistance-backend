  This bill changes how counties in Missouri are grouped into four categories based on their assessed property value. It sets specific dollar amounts to define each classification, with adjustments each year based on inflation. The bill also allows some counties with particular valuation histories to keep their previous classification. These classifications influence how counties organize their government and manage resources, impacting local governance across the state.
