summary: |
  This bill changes the rules for when someone commits a serious crime by harming or putting children under 17 at risk. It clarifies different ways a person can be guilty, such as acting in ways that threaten a child's health or safety, having illegal sexual contact with a minor, encouraging illegal activities, making or possessing illegal drugs in the presence of a child, or not securing firearms safely around children. The bill also specifies tougher penalties if the crime causes injury or death to the child. It affects parents, guardians, caregivers, and anyone who might endanger children, and it aims to better protect young people from harm.
