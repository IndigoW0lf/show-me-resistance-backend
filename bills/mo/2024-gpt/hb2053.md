summary_short: "This bill creates a pact among states to reciprocate boycotts against states that boycott them, encouraging mutual economic and travel restrictions."
summary: |
  The bill establishes the "Reciprocal Boycott Compact," which is an agreement among states to respond with a boycott if another state boycotts them. A state can join this pact by passing similar laws. When a nonmember state boycotts a member state, all participating states will immediately boycott that nonmember state on the same terms. The law is designed to help member states protect themselves from external economic or travel boycotts by requiring a coordinated response, and it requires governors to take action when notified of a boycott. This affects state governments and businesses, particularly those involved in travel, commerce, or state dealings with other states.
