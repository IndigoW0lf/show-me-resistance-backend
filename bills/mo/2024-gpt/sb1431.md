summary: |
  This bill updates Missouri law to let county, city, or town governments establish special entertainment districts focused on theaters, cultural arts, and entertainment venues. These districts can be created in specific counties based on their population size or location, including those near lakes with large shorelines. The purpose is to encourage local arts and entertainment activities, boost tourism, and support property owners within these districts. Residents and property owners in those areas will have a say in the district's formation through voting. The law clarifies how districts are formed and who can participate in elections related to the districts.
