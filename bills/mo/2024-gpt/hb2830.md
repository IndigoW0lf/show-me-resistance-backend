  The bill amends Missouri law to specify what is included in the term "reproductive health care." It states that gender transition surgeries and the use of cross-sex hormones or puberty-blocking drugs for gender transition are not considered part of reproductive health care under state laws. This change affects both minors and adults by making clear that these procedures are not categorized as reproductive health services. The bill aims to clarify legal definitions related to reproductive health, potentially impacting healthcare regulations and access.
