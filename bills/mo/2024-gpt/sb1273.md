summary: |
  This bill says that employers in Missouri cannot prevent employees from having firearms in their personal vehicles when they are on the job or conducting work activities, whether on company property or off-site. If an employer tries to enforce a ban on firearms in employees' vehicles and causes harm or damages, they can be held financially responsible in court. This law aims to protect employees' rights to carry firearms in their vehicles during work while making sure employers are aware of their legal limits.
