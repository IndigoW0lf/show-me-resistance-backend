summary_short: "Missouri is creating a new law that allows employees to take leave for family and medical reasons, similar to other state policies."
summary: |
  This bill, called the Missouri Family and Medical Leave Act, gives eligible employees in Missouri the right to take time off from work to care for their family or medical needs. It covers situations like bonding with a new child, caring for a sick family member, or dealing with their own health problems. The law applies to employers with at least ten employees and defines key terms like "family," "serious health condition," and "care." It helps workers balance their jobs and family health issues without losing their employment.
