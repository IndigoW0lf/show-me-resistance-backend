summary: |
  This bill changes the rules for fire protection in St. Louis County. It states that new cities created from unincorporated or existing municipalities cannot set up their own fire departments if fire services are already provided by fire districts. These fire districts will continue to serve the area and can collect taxes as before. The bill also clarifies how fire districts and cities should handle services and funding when areas are annexed or incorporated, including the payment calculations and residents' rights to vote in fire district elections. Overall, it aims to preserve existing fire services and clarify funding and governance between cities and fire districts in the county.
