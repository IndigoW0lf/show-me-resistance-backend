summary_short: "This law protects volunteers providing security at religious places from legal complaints and liability."

summary: |
  This bill creates legal protections for individuals who volunteer to help with security at churches, synagogues, and other places of worship. It means that these volunteers cannot be sued or held financially responsible if someone gets hurt while they are providing security, as long as they are acting in good faith and with reasonable care. The bill also states that the religious places themselves are not liable for the actions of these volunteers, unless they knew or should have known that the volunteers were not fit to provide security. Overall, the law encourages community members to help keep places of worship safe without the fear of legal repercussions.
