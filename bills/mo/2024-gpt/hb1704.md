summary: |
  The bill makes updates to procedures for investigating law enforcement officers and modifies the rules for civilian review boards. It requires that officers being investigated are informed in writing about the allegations at least 24 hours before questioning, and that complaints against officers are supported by written statements with personal information kept confidential. The bill also specifies that officers must be questioned at designated, secure locations and that questioning should be reasonable in length and during work hours unless special circumstances apply. These changes aim to ensure fair treatment of officers during investigations while maintaining transparency. The legislation affects police departments, officers, and civilian review boards across Missouri.
