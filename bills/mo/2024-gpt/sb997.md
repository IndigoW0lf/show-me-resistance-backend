summary_short: "This bill updates Missouri laws about the sale and manufacturing of hypodermic needles and drug-related equipment."
summary: |
  The bill changes existing laws to clarify and update regulations on distributing and making hypodermic needles. It defines what counts as illegal when selling or producing drug paraphernalia, with certain exemptions for authorized health organizations that provide needle exchange programs. These organizations won't be penalized if they follow specific rules, such as not being within 500 feet of a school. The law also says that selling or making such items illegally is usually a misdemeanor, but can be a more serious felony if done for commercial purposes. This affects individuals and organizations involved in handling needles or drug paraphernalia, especially those aiming to reduce health risks related to drug use.
