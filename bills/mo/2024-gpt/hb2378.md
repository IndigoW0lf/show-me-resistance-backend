summary_short: "This law designates the Missouri State Board of Education as the official body to handle appeals of decisions made by statewide school activities organizations."
summary: |
  The bill states that if a school or organization wants to appeal a decision made by a statewide activities association—such as a sports or academic group—they cannot do so through the association itself. Instead, the Missouri State Board of Education will be responsible for reviewing and ruling on these appeals. Once an appeal is submitted, the Board must hold a meeting within 48 hours and make a final decision within 24 hours. This change aims to provide a clearer and more official process for resolving disputes involving school activities, affecting public schools, students, and organizations involved in interscholastic events.
