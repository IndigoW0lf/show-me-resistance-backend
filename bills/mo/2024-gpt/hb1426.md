  This bill applies to online companies that publish or share content that could be harmful to minors, such as material with nudity or sexual conduct. If a website has a large amount of such harmful content, the company must verify that visitors are over 18 before allowing access. If they do not do this and a minor accesses harmful material, the company could be held financially responsible for any damages. The bill mainly affects online businesses and aims to protect minors from inappropriate content on the internet.
