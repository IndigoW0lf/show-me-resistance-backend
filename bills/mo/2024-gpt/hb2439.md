summary_short: "This bill creates a new unit to review certain criminal convictions to check if the person is actually innocent."
summary: |
  This bill allows the Missouri office of prosecution services to set up a special team called a conviction review unit. This team will investigate claims from people who believe they are wrongfully convicted, even if they have already pled guilty. The review process requires applicants to submit a sworn application, pay a small fee, and provide new and solid evidence of innocence. The unit will include experienced prosecutors, an investigator, and staff to examine these claims and make recommendations, but courts are not required to follow their advice. This bill aims to help clear the names of innocent people unfairly convicted and improve fairness in the justice system.
