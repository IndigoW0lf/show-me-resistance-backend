summary: |
  The bill requires that, in Missouri, the only approved method for euthanizing dogs and cats at shelters or animal control facilities is by injecting a humane drug called sodium pentobarbital or a similar approved substance. It bans the use of other methods such as gas chambers, electrocution, guns, or blunt force. If there is a shortage of sodium pentobarbital, shelters can use a different drug recognized as equally humane, but this only applies for one year. The process of euthanasia must be carried out by a licensed veterinarian or a trained medical professional to ensure it is done humanely. This bill aims to ensure that animals are put down in the most humane way possible.
