summary: |
  HB 1947 changes the current sales tax laws in Missouri to provide a specific exemption for certain used personal property. This means that some used items, which might normally be taxed when sold, will now be tax-free under this law. The goal is to make it easier and more affordable for buyers and sellers of certain used goods. This change could impact retail businesses, consumers, and others involved in the sale of used tangible personal property by reducing the sales tax they have to pay or collect.
