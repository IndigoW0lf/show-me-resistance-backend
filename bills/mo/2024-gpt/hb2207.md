summary_short: "This bill creates a statewide license for mechanical contractors in Missouri to work across the state."
summary: |
  The Missouri Statewide Mechanical Contractor Licensing Act establishes a single license that allows mechanical contractors to operate in any part of Missouri, not just local areas. It sets the rules for who needs a license, what types of work are covered, and who can be considered a mechanical contractor. This means contractors and their employees will have a clear, uniform license to work throughout the state, making it easier to do business and ensure quality work. The law affects mechanical contractors, their employees, and local licensing agencies by creating a statewide standard.
