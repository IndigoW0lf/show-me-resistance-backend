summary_short: "This bill prohibits the use of automated red light cameras by local governments and agencies in Missouri."

summary: |
  The bill prevents any city, county, town, village, or state agency in Missouri from using automated photo red light enforcement systems. These systems typically include cameras and sensors that record images of vehicles running red lights. The purpose is to stop the automatic enforcement of red light violations through these devices across all areas within the state's jurisdictions. This affects local authorities and traffic enforcement practices, limiting the ways they can monitor and ticket drivers for running red lights.
