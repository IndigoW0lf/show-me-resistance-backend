summary_short: "This bill sets rules to protect healthcare workers from violent patients and limits certain physical restraint training."
summary: |
  This law clarifies that health care employees and contractors don't have to physically engage with violent patients if they believe they might be harmed. It also prevents facilities from requiring specific restraint techniques or training that limit how staff can control violent patients, except in life-saving situations. If a patient escapes or flees, the staff won't be held liable if they acted in good faith and without gross negligence, unless the patient has certain mental or developmental disabilities. Additionally, nurses can stop caring for a patient if they are assaulted, and law enforcement must first take a person expressing suicidal intent to a jail or prison for evaluation before considering hospital treatment. Facilities that violate these new rules could lose their licenses or accreditation. This affects healthcare workers, hospitals, and mental health facilities by establishing new safety and liability standards.
