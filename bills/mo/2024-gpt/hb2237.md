summary_short: "This bill allows small cities in Missouri to waive certain residency requirements for city boards if the appointees own property or businesses in the city."
summary: |
  The bill applies to Missouri cities with no more than 2,000 residents that are classified as fourth-level cities. It states that, for these small cities, the usual rule requiring board members to live in the city can be bypassed if the appointee owns property or a business there. This applies both to general boards and to utility boards that donâ€™t have authority to set rates or issue bonds, but with additional conditions like residing within five miles of the city. The goal is to make it easier for these small cities to find qualified members to serve on their boards without strict residency rules.
