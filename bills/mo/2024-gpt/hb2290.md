summary: |
  The bill updates Missouri law to include Hannibal and Moberly as cities that can set a special sales tax to fund public safety efforts. Previously, only certain cities were allowed to do this based on their size and location. With this change, these two cities can now raise revenue through sales taxes specifically for public safety services such as police and fire departments, helping improve safety in their communities.
