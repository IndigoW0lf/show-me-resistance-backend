summary: |
  This bill establishes a pilot program in Missouri to offer a special brain treatment called eTMS (electroencephalogram combined transcranial magnetic stimulation) to veterans, federal agents, and first responders who are dealing with mental health problems, brain injuries, or related issues. The program will have a main location and up to ten additional sites, which can include mobile units, to help expand access. Providers participating in the program will follow specific rules for treatment, monitor patientsâ€™ progress, and report on their outcomes and expenses each year. This initiative aims to improve the quality of life for those who have served the community and experienced trauma or brain health challenges.
