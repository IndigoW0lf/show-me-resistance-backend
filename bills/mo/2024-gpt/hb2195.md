summary: |
  This bill changes the regulations for when school districts in Missouri can begin their school year. It requires districts to plan their calendars, including the start date, attendance days, and hours, while setting minimum standards. School districts can choose their opening date each year, but starting earlier than two weeks before September 1st is generally prohibited, unless they follow specific public notice and voting procedures, which are only allowed before the 2020-21 school year. Districts with charter schools or year-round schools are exempt from some of these rules. If districts do not follow the rules, they could lose part of their state funding. The bill aims to standardize start dates for most districts while providing some flexibility for specific types of schools.
