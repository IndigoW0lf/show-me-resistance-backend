  The bill lets school districts teach students about the roles and achievements of lesbian, gay, bisexual, and transgender people in American history and culture. It also encourages teaching about social movements, discrimination, current issues, and the impact of LGBTQ communities on society, arts, and laws. The Department of Elementary and Secondary Education will work with LGBTQ advocacy groups to create an inclusive curriculum. Schools must follow this plan while respecting all federal and state laws and constitutional rights.
