  Blair's Law creates a new crime called "unlawful discharge of a firearm" for anyone who discharges a gun within a city or town with criminal negligence. The law lists many situations where firing a gun is allowed, such as at supervised shooting ranges, during lawful hunting, or in self-defense. People who break this law can face criminal charges, with penalties that get worse if they commit the offense multiple times. This law aims to increase safety and hold individuals accountable for reckless gun use within municipalities.
