summary: |
  This legislation helps resource parents and adoptive parents by providing a process to receive repayment for unused respite care and child care subsidy days, respectively. If a child's special needs—verified by a doctor—mean that certain allotted care or subsidy days are not used within a year, the parents can submit a request to be reimbursed for the monetary value of those unused days. The Department of Elementary and Secondary Education is responsible for handling these reimbursements, which are not taxable. This bill ensures that families are not penalized financially when they cannot use these services due to their child's special needs.
