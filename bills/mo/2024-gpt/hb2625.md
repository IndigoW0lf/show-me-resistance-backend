summary_short: "This bill raises the income level that is exempt from state income tax, initially to $1,000 in 2023, then to $2,400 in 2025, meaning low-income residents will pay less tax or no tax at all."
summary: |
  The bill changes Missouri's income tax rules to increase the amount of income that is tax-free. Starting in 2023, residents will not pay tax on the first $1,000 of their income. Then, beginning in 2025, the tax-free amount will increase further to $2,400. These changes mean that people earning less money will pay less in taxes or might not owe any income tax at all, making the tax system more relief-oriented for low-income residents.
