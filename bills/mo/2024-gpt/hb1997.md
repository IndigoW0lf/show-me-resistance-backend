summary: |
  This bill mandates that all public colleges and universities in Missouri must have opioid overdose rescue kits, like Naloxone, accessible on campus before January 1, 2025. These kits must be placed in specific locations such as dorms, health centers, student unions, and sports venues, and should be clearly visible and accessible to everyone. The institutions will register the location of these kits with campus police and perform regular inspections to ensure they are available and up-to-date. Additionally, the bill requires providing training to students—starting with freshmen—on how to use the kits and where they are located. The goal is to help prevent fatal opioid overdoses by making life-saving medication readily available and easy to access on college campuses.
