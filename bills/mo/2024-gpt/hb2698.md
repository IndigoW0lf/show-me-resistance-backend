summary_short: "This bill creates a system to fire state employees if they intentionally give false information to the public during their work."
summary: |
  The bill establishes rules for government employees paid with public money, prohibiting them from intentionally providing false information when interacting with the public. It also requires the state to create an online reporting system where people can submit complaints about such misconduct. Once a complaint is filed, it will be investigated by the employee's department, and if the employee is found to have knowingly lied, they can be removed from their job. The bill aims to promote honesty and transparency in government services and makes information about these investigations publicly accessible.
