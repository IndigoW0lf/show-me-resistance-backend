summary: |
  The bill establishes the "Regulatory Sandbox Act" in Missouri, which allows businesses or individuals to try out new, innovative products or services without immediately following all the usual rules and regulations. This program is designed to encourage innovation by providing a controlled environment where participants can demonstrate their ideas to consumers. It involves a committee that oversees the program and assigns an agency responsible for managing it. The goal is to help new ideas develop faster while protecting consumers, and it mainly affects businesses, government agencies that regulate those businesses, and consumers who participate or benefit from the innovations.
