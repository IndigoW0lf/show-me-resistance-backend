summary: |
  This bill is a resolution from Missouri's government that commends Israel for its friendly and beneficial relationship with the state and the United States since 1948. It acknowledges Israel's historical claim to its lands and celebrates its independence, which was first recognized by Missouri’s own President Harry S. Truman. The bill also supports the U.S. decision to recognize Jerusalem as the capital of Israel and expresses Missouri's continued support for Israel’s right to exist and thrive. It encourages the strengthening of ties between Missouri, the U.S., and Israel and plans to send an official copy of this resolution to the Israeli Consulate in Miami. The bill mainly affects government officials and policymakers, but it also reflects Missouri’s stance on international relations.
