summary_short: "This bill proposes changing how sheriffs are elected and their roles in Missouri counties, including new election procedures and responsibilities."
summary: |
  The bill aims to amend the Missouri Constitution to establish clear rules for electing sheriffs in most counties, requiring a four-year term. It allows counties that currently do not have elected sheriffs to restore the office as an elected position if they choose, with the election being decided by voters. The bill also clarifies sheriffs' duties, including maintaining public order, responding to federal investigations, and serving court processes. Additionally, it introduces a process for voters to recall sheriffs after they have served at least six months. Overall, this affects county residents, current and future sheriffs, and local government operations.
