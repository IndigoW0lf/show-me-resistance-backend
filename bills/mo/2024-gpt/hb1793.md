summary_short: "This bill lets employees in Missouri take unpaid leave each week for mental health appointments with proper notice and certification."
summary: |
  The bill creates a new law in Missouri allowing workers to take unpaid time off each week to attend mental health appointments. Employees need to give at least 48 hours' notice unless it's not possible. Employers can ask for a certification from the healthcare provider to verify the appointment. This law applies to employees working in Missouri and aims to support mental health without requiring paid leave. It does not give more leave than what's already allowed under federal laws.
