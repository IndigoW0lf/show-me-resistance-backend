summary: |
  This bill updates the process for choosing the five commissioners of the Kansas City Area Transportation Authority. It specifies which counties and parts of Jackson County and Kansas City are represented, and it details how successors are appointed when terms end or vacancies occur. The process involves county commissions, the Kansas City mayor, and the governor, depending on where each commissioner is from. The goal is to make the appointment process clearer and structured to ensure proper representation across the different areas served by the transportation authority.
