summary: |
  This bill sets rules to limit foreign adversaries from purchasing or owning real estate in Missouri. It bans foreign governments identified as adversaries, as well as foreign businesses controlled or owned by such adversaries, from buying or holding property in the state. However, there are exceptions if the foreign entity has been in good legal standing, approved by the U.S. government for foreign investment, and has a current national security agreement. The goal is to protect Missouriâ€™s real estate from foreign influence that could threaten national security.
