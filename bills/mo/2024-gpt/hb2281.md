summary: |
  HB2281 changes the laws regarding how local governments in Missouri can collect fees from companies that provide video services, such as cable or streaming services. It defines key terms like "franchise," "gross revenues," and "franchise area," clarifying what kinds of revenues are included or excluded when calculating fees. These fees are paid by video service providers to local authorities in exchange for the right to operate in a specific area. The bill affects both the companies that provide video services and the local governments that regulate and collect these fees, ensuring clearer rules and updated definitions for future agreements.
