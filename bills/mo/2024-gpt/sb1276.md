summary: |
  This bill, SB1276, sets rules to ensure that replacement parts used in vehicle repairs are genuine, functional, and meet federal safety standards. It specifically prohibits the use of counterfeit or nonworking airbags and crash parts that are not made by the original vehicle manufacturer or authorized suppliers. The law requires that aftermarket crash parts sold in Missouri display the manufacturer's logo and that insurers clearly disclose when they plan to use non-OEM (original equipment manufacturer) parts in repairs. These measures aim to protect vehicle owners from unsafe or misleading parts and promote transparency in vehicle repairs.
