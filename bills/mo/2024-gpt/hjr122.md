summary_short: "This bill lowers the minimum age to serve in Missouri's State House and Senate from 24 and 30 to 18."
summary: |
  This bill proposes changing the Missouri Constitution to reduce the age requirements for serving in the state legislature. Currently, individuals must be at least 24 years old to be a representative and 30 years old to be a senator. The bill would lower these ages to 18, meaning younger adults can run for and serve in the State House and Senate. This change would apply starting with the elections in 2024 and could allow more young people to participate in state government.
