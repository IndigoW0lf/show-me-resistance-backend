summary: |
  This bill, called the "Designated Health Care Decision-Maker Act," establishes a process for appointing specific individuals to make health care choices for people who are unable to make these decisions on their own due to physical or mental limitations. It defines key terms such as "incapacitated," "health care," and who qualifies as a "designated decision-maker." The law ensures that these decision-makers act in the best interests of the incapacitated person, promoting their health and well-being while preventing discrimination. This legislation mainly affects people who cannot manage their own health care and the health care providers caring for them.
