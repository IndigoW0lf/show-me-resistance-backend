summary: |
  The bill mandates that every elementary school and charter school in Missouri teach students how to write in cursive. By the end of fifth grade, students should be able to produce clear, readable cursive handwriting. Additionally, students must pass a test created by their teachers to prove they are proficient in both reading and writing in cursive. The Department of Elementary and Secondary Education will set the rules for how schools should implement these requirements. This law aims to ensure students keep up with cursive writing skills, which are important for reading old documents and various forms of written communication.
