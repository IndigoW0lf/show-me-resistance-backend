summary: |
  This bill changes the rules about making threats related to emergencies or dangerous situations. If someone recklessly causes others to believe there's a threat or false danger—like a false report or false belief about a risky incident—they can be charged with a crime. The severity of the charge depends on whether the threat or false report caused harm or damage; it could be classified as a serious felony. The law also protects people acting in good faith if they are trying to prevent harm. This legislation affects anyone who might communicate or cause false threats or reports, aiming to increase safety and punish reckless behavior related to emergencies.
