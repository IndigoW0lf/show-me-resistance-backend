  The bill repeals a previous law about health education and instead calls the class "Health and Family Education." It requires the state education board to form a group of experts and experts from health and education organizations to develop new curriculum guidelines focused on health, behavioral health, chronic disease prevention, and parenting skills. The education board will then set academic standards for these classes to be followed in schools from the 2024-25 school year onward.
