summary: |
  This bill, known as HB2206, aims to make local government meetings more open and accessible for residents. It requires counties, cities, towns, and villages to adopt a policy for their meetings by July 1, 2025. The policy must include a designated time at the start of each meeting for public comments, allowing residents, business owners, and taxpayers to speak without restrictions on what they say. It sets minimum rules such as a three-minute speaking limit per person and methods for submitting written statements if they cannot attend. Additionally, it protects the right of individuals to attend meetings unless they are disruptive or pose a threat. The bill ensures that meetings are fair, transparent, and give everyone a chance to be heard, promoting greater public participation in local government decisions.
