summary: |
  This bill requires the Missouri government to develop guidelines to remove the social media app TikTok from all state-owned computers and technology by January 1, 2025. The goal is to prevent the use of TikTok on state devices, except for law enforcement activities conducted by the Missouri State Highway Patrol. The bill defines what counts as "information technology" and "covered application" and applies to all state departments and agencies. It does not target private devices or general public use but focuses on ensuring that TikTok is not used on government systems for security reasons.
