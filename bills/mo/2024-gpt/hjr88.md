summary_short: "This bill proposes changing the state constitution to allow the Missouri General Assembly to exempt certain personal property from property taxes through general laws."

summary: |
  This bill, called HJR88, suggests amending the Missouri Constitution so that the state legislature can pass laws that exempt specific types of personal property from property taxes. It would allow exemptions for items like household goods, clothing, and personal belongings, as well as certain inventory held by businesses like manufacturers and retailers. The amendment would also specify that these exemptions could be made through laws rather than needing individual legal approval. If approved by voters in the next election, these changes would give the legislature more power to reduce taxes on personal property across the state, affecting property owners, businesses, and local governments by potentially reducing their tax revenue.
