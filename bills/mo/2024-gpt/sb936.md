summary: |
  This bill establishes a paint recycling program in Missouri to safely collect and reuse leftover household architectural paint. It defines key terms like "architectural paint," "post-consumer paint," and "collection sites," and sets rules for how the program will operate. Producers of architectural paint can join a group to help manage the program, and they may have to pay an assessment fee to support it. The goal is to reduce waste and environmental harm by encouraging the proper disposal and recycling of unused paint, affecting paint manufacturers, retailers, and consumers.
