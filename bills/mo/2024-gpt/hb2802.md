summary: |
  This bill changes the requirements for serving as an election judge in Missouri. It allows active military personnel, military reserves, and their nonresident spouses to be election judges, even if they are not registered voters in Missouri. The bill also sets rules to prevent relatives of ballot candidates from serving as judges in the same election. These updates aim to make it easier for military members and their spouses to participate in election activities while maintaining fair election practices. The new rules will take effect on January 1, 2025.
