summary: |
  This bill changes the rules about selling and buying certain medications that contain drugs like ephedrine, pseudoephedrine, and phenylpropanolamine. These drugs are often found in cold and allergy medicine. The law now limits the amount a person can purchase or be sold within a 24-hour period, a 30-day period, and over a full year. For example, in a 12-month year, a person cannot buy or be sold more than about 43 grams of these drugs. Additionally, these medications must be sold behind the pharmacy counter, and only trained staff like pharmacists or pharmacy technicians can sell them. The goal is to prevent these medicines from being used to make illegal drugs, while still allowing people to buy them with a valid prescription.
