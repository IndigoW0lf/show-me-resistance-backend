summary: |
  This bill allows specific prisoners who are serving very long sentences to request a parole hearing after they've served at least 30 years. It applies to older inmates (60+ years), those serving life without parole for sentences of 50 years or more for crimes committed before 1984, and who have a clean record of dangerous felonies or sex offenses. During the hearing, the parole board will decide if the person is likely to live and stay out of trouble if released, considering their conduct in prison, efforts at self-rehabilitation, community support, and mental health. If granted parole, the person will be supervised for at least five years after release. The bill also clarifies that other parole options and clemency remain available.
