summary_short: "This bill adds a tax credit for employers who hire people in targeted groups, helping reduce their state taxes starting in 2025."
summary: |
  The Missouri Job Creators Tax Reduction Act encourages businesses to hire individuals from specific targeted groups by offering a tax credit. Starting in 2025, qualified employers can subtract a dollar-for-dollar credit from their state taxes based on the wages they pay to these workers, up to the amount of their tax liability. This is tied to the federal work opportunity credit, meaning employers benefit if they hire workers who qualify under federal programs. The bill aims to promote workforce inclusion and economic growth while supporting employers who create jobs for underserved populations. It does not offer a refundable credit, nor can the credits be transferred or carried over to future years.
