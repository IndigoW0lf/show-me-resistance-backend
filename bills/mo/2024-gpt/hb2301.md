summary_short: "This bill updates the rules for publishing legal notices and advertisements in newspapers in Missouri."

summary: |
  This bill changes the laws about how legal notices and advertisements are published in newspapers. It clarifies which newspapers are eligible, focusing on newspapers that have been published regularly for at least one year or are successors to such newspapers. The bill also allows newspapers that temporarily stopped publishing during wartime to be reinstated within a year after hostilities end. Local governments, courts, and newspapers in Missouri will need to follow these new rules when publishing legally required notices, especially in larger cities with populations over 100,000.
