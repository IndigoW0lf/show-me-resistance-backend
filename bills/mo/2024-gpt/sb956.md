summary: |
  This bill changes the rules for eye care professionals called optometrists. It allows them to use injectable medications and perform some minor surgical procedures to treat eye conditions, with some limits. However, it still restricts them from performing more complex surgeries like laser eye surgery or corneal transplants, except for pre- and post-operative care. The goal is to expand the treatments optometrists can provide while maintaining safety for more advanced surgeries. This affects both eye care providers and patients by broadening the range of treatments available to optometrists.
