summary: |
  This bill updates the Senate rules to improve how bills are handled. It states that any bill filed before the start of a new legislative session must be sent to a committee within 30 days. The bill also clarifies that bills need to be reviewed and reported on by a committee before they can be passed into law, and it gives senators more power to move bills between committees or to the full Senate for a vote. These changes aim to make the legislative process clearer and more efficient for everyone involved.
