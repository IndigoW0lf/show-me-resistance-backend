summary_short: "This bill updates rules about county health ordinances in Missouri, including how they are made, shared, and enforced."

summary: |
  The bill changes how county health departments in Missouri can create and apply health rules to protect public health. It allows county commissions and health boards to establish local ordinances and regulations to prevent the spread of diseases, as long as they follow state rules and do not conflict with or add extra restrictions to existing laws. The bill also authorizes counties to set reasonable fees to fund these health activities, with protections for people who cannot pay. Once local rules are adopted, counties must publish them in newspapers and make them available to the public. Violating these health rules can lead to misdemeanor charges. This legislation affects local governments, health departments, and residents by clarifying how health rules are created, shared, and enforced at the county level.
