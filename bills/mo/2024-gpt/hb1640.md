summary_short: "This bill changes the penalties for crimes involving the custody of children in Missouri."

summary: |
  This bill updates Missouri laws about crimes related to child custody. It clarifies what counts as interfering with custody and parental kidnapping, making the penalties clearer and stronger. Specifically, it increases the severity of charges if someone takes or hides a child without permission, especially if the child is moved out of state. It also sets stricter penalties if someone with custody rights takes a child without a good reason and with the intent to deprive the other parent or guardian of their custody rights. The law applies to both adults who commit these acts and to courts that issue custody orders, and it allows courts to order restitution for costs related to finding or returning the child.
