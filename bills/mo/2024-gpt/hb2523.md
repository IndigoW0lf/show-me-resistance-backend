summary: |
  The bill creates a new law that makes it illegal for undocumented immigrants to enter or stay on private or public land without permission. If an undocumented person over 18 commits such an act, they could be charged with a level that is classified as a Class E felony, which is a serious crime.

The bill aims to address issues related to illegal immigration and trespassing, affecting landowners and law enforcement.
