summary: |
  The bill changes how Missouri handles cases involving juveniles who commit serious crimes. It allows courts to hold hearings to decide if a teen aged 15 to 18 should be transferred to adult court for serious offenses, including murder and other major crimes. The bill also clarifies that certain severe crimes automatically require a hearing, and it sets rules for judges to consider whether to transfer the case. Additionally, it addresses what happens when a person aged 18 to 21 is involved in a case still under juvenile court jurisdiction, and it states that lying about age won't affect legal proceedings. Overall, this bill aims to define clearer procedures for trying certain juvenile offenders as adults while ensuring due process.
