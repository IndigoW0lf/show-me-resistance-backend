summary_short: "This bill requires all initiative petitions certified by the secretary of state to be heard and debated in committee and on the house floor before they become law."
summary: |
  This bill makes a new rule for citizen-proposed laws (initiative petitions) in Missouri. Once a petition is approved by the secretary of state, it must go through a public hearing in a committee of each legislative chamber. After the hearing, it will be debated on the house and senate floors without the ability to be amended or voted on until each chamber completes its process. This process is designed to increase transparency and ensure thorough review before any initiative can become law. The bill affects both citizens who propose laws through initiatives and members of the state legislature.
