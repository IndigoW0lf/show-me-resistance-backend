summary_short: "This bill limits how much correctional facilities and jails can charge inmates for phone calls to ensure fair access."

summary: |
  The bill requires correctional centers and jails in Missouri to give inmates reasonable access to phone calls. It also sets maximum charges for domestic calls: correctional centers can't charge more than 12 cents per minute, and jails can't charge more than 14 cents per minute if they house 1,000 or more inmates, or 21 cents per minute if they house fewer than 1,000 inmates. This is meant to make phone calls affordable for inmates and reduce excessive fees.
