summary_short: "This bill establishes a new program to develop community solar projects that allow residents and organizations to benefit from solar energy through shared facilities in Missouri."

summary: |
  This bill creates a pilot program in Missouri to support community solar energy projects. It defines how these projects work, including how subscribers—who can be individual residents or organizations—can receive credits on their electric bills for the electricity generated. The program encourages the development of solar facilities between 100 and 5,000 kilowatts in size, located within Missouri, and with at least ten subscribers. It aims to make solar energy more accessible, especially for low-income households and community organizations, by allowing them to participate in shared solar projects without needing to install solar panels on their own properties.
