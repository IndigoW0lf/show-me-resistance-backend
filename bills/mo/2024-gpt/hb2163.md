summary_short: "This bill updates laws about dog regulation and animal rabies reporting in Missouri to improve safety and clarify which rules cities and counties can enforce."
summary: |
  This bill makes several changes to Missouri's laws regarding animals. It stops local governments from creating breed-specific restrictions on dogs, meaning rules cannot target specific dog breeds. Existing breed-specific regulations must be updated or they will become unenforceable by February 2025. The bill also clarifies that local agencies can still regulate dogs in other ways and enact laws about dangerous dogs that aren't based on breed. Additionally, it sets procedures for reporting and handling animal bite incidents that could spread rabies, requiring coordination between law enforcement, public health agencies, and the Department of Health and Senior Services to keep the public safe from rabies and other diseases.
