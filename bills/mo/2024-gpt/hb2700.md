summary_short: "This bill updates Missouri laws on drug distribution, increasing penalties for certain drug offenses and clarifying when they apply."
summary: |
  The bill rewrites Missouriâ€™s rules about delivering controlled substances, like illegal drugs. It makes it a crime to knowingly give, attempt to give, or allow others to buy or transport illegal drugs, with harsher penalties for certain situations. For example, if someone delivers a large amount of a drug or if a delivery results in serious injury or death, the penalties are more severe. It also clarifies that giving small amounts of marijuana to minors or permiting minors to buy drugs can lead to stricter charges. These changes mainly affect people involved in drug trafficking and those who deliver or facilitate drug use, making it clearer and tougher to address drug crimes.
