summary: |
  This bill requires the Missouri Department of Transportation to put up signs indicating the boundaries of the Ozark Highlands Region. They will work with the Ozark Highland Distillers Guild to ensure the signs are suitable and informative. These signs will be placed along highways as drivers approach or enter the region. The funding for these signs will come from private donations, not public money. The goal is to help visitors and residents recognize and learn about this scenic area.
