summary: |
  This bill changes the rules for how gas companies in Missouri offer discounts to certain customers. It allows both new and current customers who plan to use large amounts of gas—at least 135,000 or 270,000 cubic feet per year—to get a 25% discount on their bills for up to four years. To qualify, customers must apply at least 90 days before they start using the higher amount of gas and must meet other criteria, such as receiving economic development support. The discounts are intended to encourage economic growth and support businesses that need a lot of gas. The gas companies will verify the customer's usage each year to ensure they still qualify for the discount.
