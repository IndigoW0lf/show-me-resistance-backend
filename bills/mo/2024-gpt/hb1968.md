summary: |
  The bill states that in Missouri, a franchisee and its employees are not automatically viewed as employees of the franchisor. Instead, they are only considered employees of the franchisor if the franchisor exercises direct and immediate control over key employment decisions like hiring, firing, and discipline. This means that, unless the franchisor actively manages these employment actions, the franchisee and its workers remain separate from the franchisorâ€™s employment responsibilities. The law helps clarify employment relationships in franchise agreements, protecting both franchisees and franchisors from certain legal assumptions.
