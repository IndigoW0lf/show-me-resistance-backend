summary_short: "Allows metropolitan school districts in Missouri to ask voters to approve a small property tax to fund special educational services."
summary: |
  This bill gives school districts in metropolitan areas the option to impose a property tax of up to three cents per hundred dollars of property value. The district must first ask voters in a general election if they support the tax, which will be used only for funding special educational services. If voters approve, the money collected will go into a dedicated trust fund to be used specifically for these services, helping improve education for students with special needs.
