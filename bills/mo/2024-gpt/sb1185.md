summary_short: "This bill removes the expiration date on certain restrictions related to gender transition treatments for minors in Missouri."
summary: |
  This bill updates existing laws about gender transition treatments for people under 18 in Missouri. It removes the previous date when some restrictions, like not giving hormones or performing surgeries for minors, would no longer apply. The bill states that healthcare providers cannot perform gender transition surgeries on anyone under 18 and cannot prescribe cross-sex hormones or puberty blockers to minors under 18, with some exceptions for treatments already provided before August 28, 2023. It aims to keep these restrictions in place indefinitely, rather than just temporarily, protecting minors from certain gender transition procedures.
