summary_short: "This bill updates the rules for the Waterways and Ports Trust Fund in Missouri to better support port and waterway improvements through a clearer, longer-lasting funding process."
summary: |
  This bill makes changes to how Missouri's Waterways and Ports Trust Fund is managed. It establishes the fund in the state treasury, allowing it to receive money from the state, gifts, grants, and donations. The fund is set up to support physical projects that improve transportation, ports, and waterways in Missouri. To qualify for funding, projects must be related to ports or rivers, located on port land or nearby, and able to be completed within two years. The bill also clarifies that the fund's money can be used as a local match for other grants and states that the fund will exist until August 2033, after which any remaining money will go to the state's general revenue. This affects transportation agencies, port authorities, and project developers working on waterway or port improvements in Missouri.
