summary_short: "This bill updates rules about accessing and sharing criminal history information for expungement and legal aid services in Missouri."

summary: |
  This bill changes existing laws to clarify how criminal history information can be shared to help individuals with their expungement process. It allows sheriff offices and courts to share criminal records with private groups like legal clinics and organizations that assist people seeking to clear their records. These organizations can use this information to help eligible individuals apply for expungement at no cost, but they must remove personal identifiers to protect privacy. The bill aims to make it easier for qualified groups to support people in clearing their criminal records, which can improve their chances for employment and housing.
