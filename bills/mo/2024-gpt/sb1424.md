summary_short: "This law sets rules and penalties for sharing intimate digital images without consent to protect individuals from non-consensual digital sexual content."

summary: |
  This bill, called "The Taylor Swift Act," makes it illegal to share or disclose digital images that depict an individual's intimate body parts or sexual conduct without their permission. It defines what counts as an "intimate digital depiction" and what qualifies as consent. If someone discloses such images without the person's consent, knowing that they didn't have permission, they can be sued in civil court for damages. The law also specifies that guardians or representatives can act on behalf of minors or incapacitated individuals to enforce these protections. It aims to prevent the harmful spread of non-consensual digital sexual content and provides clear legal recourse for victims.
