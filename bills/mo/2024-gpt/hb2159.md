summary_short: "The bill prevents the public from seeing the names of people who complain about child care facilities."
summary: |
  This bill changes the rules about how complaints against licensed child care facilities are handled. It requires the Department of Elementary and Secondary Education to keep records of confirmed complaints from parents, but it states that the identities of the people who made those complaints will not be shared with the public. This means that anyone requesting information about complaints will be able to see what was reported and the findings, but they won't see who made the complaint. The bill aims to protect the privacy of those who report concerns about child care homes and centers.
