summary_short: "This bill makes it illegal to produce, sell, or possess intoxicating cannabinoids in Missouri, treating them the same as marijuana under state law."

summary: |
  The bill strictly regulates substances called intoxicating cannabinoids, which are chemicals that can produce a psychoactive or "high" effect when consumed. It defines what counts as an intoxicating cannabinoid and states that these substances are legally considered to be the same as marijuana. This means they must be controlled and regulated by the Missouri Department of Health and Senior Services, just like marijuana, including rules for their cultivation, manufacturing, selling, and transportation. The bill also involves law enforcement agencies to ensure these regulations are enforced. Overall, it aims to control and restrict the use of synthetic or plant-derived substances that can cause intoxication similar to marijuana.
