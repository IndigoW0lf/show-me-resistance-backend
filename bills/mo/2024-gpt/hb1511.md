summary_short: "Missouri law requires governments to cover the costs of installing and maintaining public electric vehicle charging stations, but limits the number they can require at larger parking lots."
summary: |
  This bill in Missouri states that local governments or other government entities cannot be responsible for paying for electric vehicle charging stations at more than five spots in a parking lot with over thirty parking spaces. It applies mainly to cities with populations over one million or counties with more than a million residents. These governments canâ€™t require schools or religious organizations to install charging stations. However, business and property owners are free to pay for their own charging stations if they choose. The law aims to promote electric vehicle use while restricting the burden on local governments to install and maintain these stations.
