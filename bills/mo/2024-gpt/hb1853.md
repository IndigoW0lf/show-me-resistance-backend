summary_short: "This bill requires utility companies to clearly explain, itemize, and offer payment options for back charges on customer bills."
summary: |
  The bill requires utility companies regulated by the Public Service Commission to include specific information when billing customers for back charges. Back charges are costs for services provided before the current billing period that were not billed earlier, usually due to an error by the utility or the customer. When billing for these charges, utilities must explain why the charges are being billed, list the services and dates involved, and provide options for payment plans. This law aims to make billing more transparent and help customers understand and manage their charges better.
