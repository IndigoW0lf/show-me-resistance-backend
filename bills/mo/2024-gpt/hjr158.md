summary_short: "A proposed Missouri constitutional amendment to clarify and expand gun rights, allowing some local regulation and specifying restrictions for certain groups."
summary: |
  This bill proposes a constitutional amendment in Missouri that would change the state's gun laws. It would remove the current wording about citizens' right to keep and bear arms and replace it with language emphasizing that the right is unalienable, but still allows laws to limit this right for violent felons or people deemed a danger due to mental health issues. The amendment also clarifies that cities like St. Louis and Kansas City can create local rules about carrying and possessing firearms, including issuing permits and setting penalties, as long as those rules align with state and federal law. This affects gun owners, law enforcement, local governments, and residents of Missouri, by balancing the right to bear arms with local regulation and restrictions for certain groups.
