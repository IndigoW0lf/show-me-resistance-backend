summary: |
  This bill establishes the "Critical Incident Stress Management Program" within the Missouri Department of Public Safety. The program offers services like counseling and crisis intervention to help police officers and firefighters deal with psychological stress after traumatic events. All peace officers and firefighters will be required to have a mental health check-in with a program provider every three to five years, with the provider notifying their supervisors of the completion. The bill also sets up a special fund, called the "988 Public Safety Fund," which will hold money allocated by the state to pay for these mental health and stress management services. These measures aim to support first respondersâ€™ mental health and ensure they have access to necessary assistance after difficult or distressing incidents.
