summary: |
  This bill, known as HB2628, prohibits the distribution of certain fake or manipulated videos, images, or audio (called deepfakes) that could mislead voters about candidates or political parties within 90 days of an election. It requires creators of such media to clearly disclose when content has been generated or altered using artificial intelligence or digital manipulation. If someone violates these rules, they can face legal penalties, including fines or criminal charges. The bill aims to protect voters from deceptive political content and gives candidates a way to seek court orders to stop false media about them.
