summary_short: "This legislation aims to support new and minority-owned businesses by improving contract opportunities and transparency."
summary: |
  This bill, called the "Right-to-Start Act," updates Missouri laws to help new businesses, especially those owned by minorities, women, and veterans, get more government contracts. It requires the state to report annually on how many contracts are awarded to small, new, and minority-owned businesses, including how much money is involved. The bill also encourages the government to consider less-restrictive rules that make it easier for small businesses to comply and succeed. These changes are designed to promote business development and ensure fair access to government opportunities for diverse and emerging businesses.
