summary: |
  This legislation updates rules around prescription drugs to give patients more freedom and transparency. It states that patients can choose any licensed pharmacy to fill their prescriptions, whether in person or electronically. The bill also prevents pharmacy benefit managers from requiring pharmacies or pharmacists to charge more than the planâ€™s copay or the cash price, ensuring lower costs at the counter. Additionally, pharmacists can provide information about costs directly to patients without needing approval from insurance managers. Overall, it aims to improve patient choice and reduce unexpected pharmacy charges.
