summary: |
  The bill aims to update Missouri's constitution to set the mandatory retirement age for judges (except municipal judges) at 75 years old. It also allows judges to retire earlier if they choose and participate in retirement plans. Additionally, retired judges can be reassigned as senior judges to help in courts, with full powers while serving in these roles. This legislation will be put to voters in the 2024 election for approval.
