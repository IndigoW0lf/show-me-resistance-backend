summary: |
  This bill updates Missouri law to permit adults aged 21 and older to use psilocybin, a substance found in some mushrooms, for therapeutic purposes if they have conditions like PTSD, depression, substance use disorder, or need end-of-life care. People can do this legally if they are part of a clinical trial or attempting to join one, and if they follow certain rules, such as informing the health department, getting a doctorâ€™s documentation, having a licensed professional present during use, and testing the substance in a licensed lab. The bill also clarifies that assisting others in following these rules is not illegal. Overall, it creates a legal pathway for certain patients to access psilocybin therapy under regulated conditions.
