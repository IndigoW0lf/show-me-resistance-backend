summary_short: "This bill makes it illegal to file false or unjustified legal claims or documents against property or people, especially to harass or deceive others."

summary: |
  This bill aims to prevent abuse of the legal system by banning the filing of fake or groundless documents and liens that are not supported by law or court orders. It specifically defines what constitutes a spurious document or lien and sets clear rules for when these claims can be recorded or stayed. If such a false claim is filed, it cannot affect property for more than 35 days unless legal action is taken to enforce it. The bill helps protect property owners and government officials from false legal claims and ensures that only valid, legally authorized liens and documents are used in property disputes.
