summary: |
  This bill establishes a new "Motivational Boot Camp Incarceration Program" within Missouri's Department of Corrections. It is designed for young adults aged 17 to 21 who have been convicted of nonviolent crimes and have previous multiple convictions. Instead of traditional jail or prison time, eligible individuals can be sentenced to participate in a two-year boot camp that emphasizes physical activity, work, and behavioral counseling to help correct maladaptive behaviors and promote self-discipline. The program aims to provide a humane and constructive alternative to imprisonment for certain repeat nonviolent offenders, with the goal of fostering personal growth and reducing future criminal behavior.
