summary: |
  This bill changes existing laws about charitable and community support tax credits in Missouri. It allows certain businesses to receive a tax credit of up to 70% of their donations to approved programs, which can be used to reduce various taxes like income, insurance, bank, and franchise taxes. The bill increases the maximum credit amount, helping encourage more donations to community projects, especially in smaller or agricultural areas. It also sets new limits on how much total credit can be allocated each year and establishes rules for special program priorities and geographic eligibility.
