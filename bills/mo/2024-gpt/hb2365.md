summary_short: "The bill bans state departments from spending money on diversity, equity, and inclusion programs that promote special treatment, divisive identity politics, or limit free speech."

summary: |
  This bill prevents state government departments in Missouri from using funds on programs or initiatives related to diversity, equity, and inclusion that favor certain groups based on race, gender, or ethnicity, or that promote divisive social theories. It also stops these departments from supporting ideas that suggest disparities are only caused by oppression or that promote collective guilt. However, departments can still follow federal and state anti-discrimination laws and the Americans with Disabilities Act. Additionally, the bill forbids the state from requiring private companies that do business with the state to adopt such programs as a condition of getting a contract. Overall, it limits how the government can promote certain social initiatives related to diversity and inclusion.
