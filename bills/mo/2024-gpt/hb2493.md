summary_short: "This bill allows public officials to use campaign funds to pay for childcare costs related to campaigning or official duties."
summary: |
  This legislation updates Missouri law to explicitly permit public officials and candidates to use campaign funds for childcare expenses that arise while they are campaigning or performing official responsibilities. It clarifies that such costs are legal expenses and ensures they are not considered personal use of campaign money. The bill also specifies other permissible uses for campaign funds, such as campaign operations, constituent events, and charitable donations, while establishing rules for the management and disposal of campaign funds upon a candidate's death. The goal is to make it easier for public officials to balance work and family responsibilities without violating campaign finance rules.
