summary_short: "Missouri proposes to stop changing clocks seasonally and stay on standard time permanently, but will follow federal changes if they occur."

summary: |
  This bill aims to make Missouri permanently switch to standard time and stop observing daylight saving time. The state will have one last time change to daylight saving time and then keep the same time year-round. However, if the federal government later decides to make daylight saving time the new standard time nationally, Missouri will adopt that change automatically. This affects everyone in Missouri by eliminating the twice-a-year clock changes and setting a consistent time throughout the year.
