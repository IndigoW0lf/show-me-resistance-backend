summary_short: "This bill allows professionals with work experience from outside Missouri to apply for a temporary license to work in the state for up to two years."
summary: |
  This bill makes it easier for people who have worked in certain professions outside Missouri to temporarily work in the state. If they have at least three years of experience and the profession is licensed in Missouri, they can apply for a one-time, nonrenewable two-year license. To get this license, they must pass the relevant exam and meet other requirements, but the license cannot be issued if they have had previous disciplinary actions or revocations outside Missouri. This change helps experienced professionals to work temporarily in Missouri without needing a full license right away, but it doesn't apply to certain jobs like electricians, federal workers, or assistant physicians. The bill aims to increase workforce flexibility while maintaining certain standards and protections.
