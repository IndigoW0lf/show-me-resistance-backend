summary_short: "This bill updates food labeling rules in Missouri to improve consumer information and require clear labels on allergens, caffeine, and product ingredients."

summary: |
  The bill modifies Missouri's food labeling laws to ensure better transparency for consumers. It allows the Department of Health and Senior Services to create rules that include a simple front-of-package label showing important info like high levels of sodium, added sugars, calories, or saturated fats. It also requires clear labels for common allergens, gluten ingredients, and caffeine content above ten milligrams per serving. Additionally, if products use images of fruits and vegetables or claim to have whole grains, the label must show the percentage of those ingredients. These regulations help shoppers make more informed choices about the food they buy and may be stricter than federal rules to protect public health.
