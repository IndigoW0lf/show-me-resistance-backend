summary: |
  The bill updates existing laws to give homeowners more freedom in their properties. It specifically allows residents to keep chickens even if their neighborhood has rules that previously restricted them. The bill also states that homeowners' associations cannot completely ban political signs, solar panels, or sale signs, though they can set reasonable rules about their size, placement, and display time. Additionally, the bill explains how associations can remove signs that threaten safety or break rules, and it clarifies that property owners can install solar panels on their roofs without restrictions from neighborhood rules. Overall, this legislation aims to make it easier for homeowners to have chickens, display signs, and install solar energy devices while ensuring reasonable regulations are still in place.
