summary: |
  This bill creates a new community solar pilot program in Missouri, allowing groups of people or organizations to participate in shared solar energy projects. These projects generate solar power that is connected to the electricity grid, and subscribers—such as residents, tenants, or social service organizations—can receive credits on their electric bills based on the solar energy produced. The program is designed to help lower-income customers and broadens access to renewable energy by allowing participation from remote locations. It aims to promote clean energy use, reduce electricity costs, and increase access to solar power for more Missourians.
