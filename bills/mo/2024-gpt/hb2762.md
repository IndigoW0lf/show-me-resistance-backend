summary_short: "This bill limits how police can use canines, banning their use for arrests, crowd control, or biting, but allows search and rescue or detection activities."
summary: |
  This bill sets rules for police use of dogs, known as police canines. It says officers cannot use dogs that are off-leash to make arrests, control crowds at protests, or force people to bite. However, police can still use these dogs for searches, finding explosives, or detecting drugs, as long as they donâ€™t bite. The goal is to make sure police canine use is safer and more respectful of people's rights.
