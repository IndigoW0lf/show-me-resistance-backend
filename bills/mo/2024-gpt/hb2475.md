summary: |
  The bill, HB2475, aims to make it easier for people and businesses to repair products like construction machinery, farm equipment, and certain electronics. It requires manufacturers to provide repair manuals, software updates, and other helpful information to authorized repair providers and, in some cases, directly to consumers. This helps prevent unnecessary repairs from replacing entire products and promotes fair access to repair resources, benefiting individual owners, independent repair shops, and the environment by reducing waste.
