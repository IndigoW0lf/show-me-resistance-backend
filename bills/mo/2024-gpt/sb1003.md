summary_short: "This bill updates rules for petition circulators, including registration, age, and penalties for dishonesty."
summary: |
  The bill changes the requirements for people who gather signatures for petitions. It states that circulators must be at least 18 years old, U.S. citizens, and register with the Secretary of State for each election cycle they work. Circulators cannot be paid based on the number of signatures they collect. They must also sign an affidavit in front of a notary for each petition page and swear that the signatures are valid, with penalties for lying. These rules aim to ensure honesty and standardize who can gather signatures for ballot measures.
