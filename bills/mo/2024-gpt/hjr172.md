summary_short: "This bill proposes a new constitutional amendment to protect and clarify gun rights in Missouri, allowing certain local regulations."
summary: |
  The bill aims to change Missouriâ€™s Constitution to strengthen the right of citizens to keep and bear arms, including ammunition and related accessories, for self-defense and protecting property. It removes the current rule and replaces it with a new section that states these rights are unchangeable and must be upheld by the state. The bill also allows cities like St. Louis and Kansas City to create their own laws regulating firearms, including issuing permits, setting fees, and enforcing penalties, as long as these laws follow certain rules. It affects gun owners, local governments, law enforcement, and those involved in gun regulation.
