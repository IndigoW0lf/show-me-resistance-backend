summary: |
  This bill changes the rules about fees that offenders pay while on probation or parole. Specifically, it states that most offenders will not have to pay certain monthly fees, except if they are under lifetime supervision or need electronic monitoring services. The goal is to make it easier for many offenders to reintegrate into the community without the burden of additional fees. It also clarifies how parole decisions are made and what conditions offenders must meet to be released.
