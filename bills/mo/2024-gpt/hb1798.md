summary: |
  This bill changes the rules for special personalized license plates in Missouri. It raises the fee for getting or reissuing a personalized plate from fifteen dollars to thirty dollars, paid when applying for a new or replacement plate. The bill also clarifies that owners must apply each year if they want to keep their personalized plates, but they can replace their plates every three years at no extra cost. It ensures plates are visually clear at night, safe, and respectful, and it gives priority to current personalized plate owners for future reissues. The changes affect vehicle owners who want personalized plates, making the process more uniform and slightly more expensive.
