summary_short: "This bill updates rules about where businesses can sell alcohol near schools and churches in Missouri."

summary: |
  The bill changes existing laws about selling alcohol near schools, churches, and places of worship. It clarifies how close alcohol sales can be to these buildings, allowing local authorities to set distance limits up to 300 feet. The bill also states that certain licenses already issued before 2004, or licenses for specific organizations like churches and charities, are not affected by these new rules. Additionally, businesses must obtain a zoning permit through local government hearings before selling alcohol, especially if the proposed location is close to sensitive sites. Overall, this bill aims to better regulate alcohol sales near community and religious centers to improve public safety and neighborhood planning.
