summary_short: "This bill creates rules to prevent the spread of invasive plants in Missouri and sets penalties for violations."
summary: |
  The bill adds new laws to help protect Missouri's natural areas from invasive plants that can harm the environment. It makes it illegal to knowingly import, buy, sell, transport, or propagate these plants without written permission from the state's agriculture director. There are exceptions for activities like research, education, control, or disposal. The bill also requires the department of agriculture to maintain a list of invasive plants, which currently includes species like burning bush and Japanese honeysuckle. Violations can result in notices, hearings, and fines, and the law aims to differentially regulate the handling of invasive plant species to protect local ecosystems.
