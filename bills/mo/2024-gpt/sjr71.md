summary_short: "A proposed constitutional amendment in Missouri to fund law enforcement salaries and benefits through additional costs and fees."
summary: |
  This bill suggests changing the Missouri Constitution to ensure that money collected from certain costs and fees is used to pay the salaries and benefits of law enforcement officials like sheriffs, prosecutors, and circuit attorneys. The goal is to make sure that these critical justice system workers are properly funded. The amendment will be voted on by Missouri residents in the next general election, and it helps to protect ongoing support for law enforcement personnel involved in both criminal and civil cases.
