summary_short: "A proposed constitutional change allowing Missouri's legislature to veto transportation department spending plans with a simple majority vote."

summary: |
  This bill suggests adding a new rule to Missouri's Constitution that would give the stateâ€™s legislature the power to cancel or block transportation department spending plans, including big projects and programs. The legislature could do this with just a majority vote. This change is meant to give the legislature more control over how transportation funds are spent. The decision to approve or reject transportation budgets would be made by voters in the next election, or in a special election if called by the governor.
