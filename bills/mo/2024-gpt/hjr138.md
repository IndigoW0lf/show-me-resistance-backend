summary: |
  The bill aims to amend Missouriâ€™s constitution to explicitly protect the right of citizens to keep and bear arms. It removes the current language and replaces it with a new section that affirms this right as unalienable and sets rules for when restrictions can be made. It also allows cities like St. Louis and Kansas City to create their own laws about firearm possession, carrying, and transfer, including issuing permits and penalties. The bill affects gun owners, law enforcement, and local governments by clarifying rights and powers related to firearms in Missouri.
