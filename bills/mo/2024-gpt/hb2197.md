summary: |
  The bill changes the rules for government agencies when creating new regulations. It states that an agency cannot put a new rule into effect unless it first repeals at least two of its existing rules. Additionally, the new rule must be based on proper legal authority, must not conflict with state laws, and cannot be so unfair or arbitrary that it causes undue hardship. This law applies to all state departments, agencies, commissions, and boards, and is designed to keep regulations clear, fair, and properly authorized.
