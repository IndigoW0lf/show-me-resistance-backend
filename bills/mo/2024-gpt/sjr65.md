summary_short: "This bill limits how much property values can increase for certain properties near tax-advantaged subdivisions in Missouri."

summary: |
  This legislation proposes an amendment to the Missouri Constitution that, if approved by voters, will prevent the assessed value of certain properties from increasing while they remain in specific subdivisions next to areas receiving tax benefits. It applies to properties classified as subclass 1 of class 1, ensuring their assessed value does not go up during the time they are located in these legally defined areas. The Department of Revenue will manage a program to enforce this rule. This measure mainly affects property owners in these designated subdivisions and aims to control property value increases in areas near tax-advantaged zones.
