summary_short: "This bill changes the rules for when juveniles can be tried as adults, including new procedures and penalties."
summary: |
  This bill updates Missouri laws about how and when juveniles aged 14 to 18 can be transferred to adult court for serious crimes. It allows courts to hold hearings to decide if a juvenile should be prosecuted as an adult, especially for certain serious crimes like murder, assault, or rape. The bill also sets rules about how these hearings are notified, and how evidence can be used if a juvenile misstates their age. These changes impact juvenile offenders, their families, and the justice system by clarifying the process for trying serious juvenile cases as adults.
