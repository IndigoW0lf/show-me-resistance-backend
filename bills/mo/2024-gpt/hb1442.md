summary: |
  This bill explains how Missouri will select and appoint its commissioners to attend an Article V convention, which is a special meeting called to suggest changes to the U.S. Constitution. It states that Missouri will have a certain number of commissioners based on the state's congressional districts, with some designated as alternates. The bill also sets rules for who can be a commissioner, requiring them to be Missouri citizens and meet certain eligibility criteria, while preventing members of Congress, federal employees, and statewide officials from serving. Additionally, it describes how the commissioners will be chosen by the state legislature, how they will take an oath to follow instructions, and how they will work together at the convention. This affects Missouri legislators, citizens, and anyone interested in how the state participates in national constitutional debates.
