summary_short: "The bill requires training programs on rules and best practices for college leaders and governing board members in Missouri."

summary: |
  This law mandates that the Missouri Department of Higher Education and Workforce Development create and run training programs on important rules, standards, and best practices for all current and future leaders of colleges and universities, including governing board members, presidents, and chancellors. Existing leaders must complete this training within two years of the law taking effect, and new appointees must do so within two years of their appointment. The goal is to ensure that college leaders are knowledgeable about the rules they must follow, improving accountability and decision-making in higher education. The department will work with outside vendors to develop these training programs, and individuals who do not complete the training could face warnings or replacement.
