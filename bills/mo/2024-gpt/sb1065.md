summary: |
  This bill, called the Career-Tech Certificate (CTC) Program, sets up a new fund to reimburse students for costs related to career-focused training programs. It applies to students who are eligible for the "A+ Schools Program" and are enrolled in short-term programs that lead to industry-recognized certificates, such as CNA or CDL courses. The program will start in the 2025-26 school year and help students cover tuition, books, and fees at approved training institutions including community colleges, technical schools, and virtual providers. Reimbursements will be limited to the same rate charged by public community colleges, ensuring that aid is provided fairly and within budget. This initiative aims to support students pursuing in-demand careers and help address occupational shortages in Missouri.
