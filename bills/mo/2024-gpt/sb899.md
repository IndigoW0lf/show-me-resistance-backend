summary_short: "This bill simplifies licensing requirements for certain school-based child care programs in Missouri."

summary: |
  This legislation updates Missouri law to clarify that child care programs operated on elementary or secondary school property, which are already licensed by the Department of Elementary and Secondary Education, must follow all child-care licensing rules. However, for safety, health, and fire standards, these programs are automatically considered in compliance with the relevant regulations. The change mainly affects school-based child care providers and ensures they meet safety standards while reducing some administrative requirements.
