summary: |
  The bill proposes a constitutional amendment that will be decided by voters in the November 2024 election. It removes existing rules about Missouri's General Assembly and replaces them with new sections. The changes include establishing a new, independent commission to draw district boundaries fairly, based on population and respecting communities and political boundaries. This aims to make districting more transparent, unbiased, and legal under federal law, affecting how state representatives are elected and who influences redistricting decisions.
