summary_short: "This bill updates the rules for verifying whether someone is disabled so they can get parking permits or placards."
summary: |
  This bill changes the laws in Missouri about how people with disabilities can get parking permits. It defines what it means to be "physically disabled" and who can certify someone as disabled, including certain healthcare professionals like nurses and physiotherapists. It also explains what qualifies as a disability that allows a person to receive a special parking placard or windshield permit, such as limited walking ability or severe health conditions. The goal is to make it clearer and easier for eligible disabled individuals to access necessary parking accommodations.
