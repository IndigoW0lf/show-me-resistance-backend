summary_short: "This bill updates how Missouri reimburses jails for costs when people are in custody, setting clear rules and limits."
summary: |
  The bill replaces an older law with new rules that specify when and how the state of Missouri will pay counties and cities for holding people in jail. It establishes a daily per diem (up to $37.50) that the state can reimburse for each day an inmate is in custody, when certain conditions are met, such as sentencing to prison or revoking probation or parole. The law also outlines how counties and cities can submit claims for reimbursement and requires the Department of Corrections to review and approve these claims. This change aims to improve transparency and ensure that local governments are fairly compensated for holding inmates, while clarifying the process and limits for payments.
