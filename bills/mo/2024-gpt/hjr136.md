summary_short: "This bill proposes changing Missouri's constitution to protect the right to keep and bear arms, with specific regulations for cities and counties."
summary: |
  The bill aims to amend the Missouri Constitution to better protect residents' rights to own and carry firearms. It states that these rights are unalienable and cannot be questioned, though certain restrictions can be made for convicted violent offenders or people with mental health issues. The bill also allows cities like St. Louis and Kansas City to create their own local laws about firearm possession and permits, as long as they follow federal and state guidelines. These local laws can include permit fees, background checks, and penalties for violations, but must respect residents' rights and include exceptions for law enforcement, judges, military members, and security personnel. The changes will be decided by voters in Missouri during the next general election or a special election.
