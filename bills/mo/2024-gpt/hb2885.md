summary: |
  This bill establishes that if a teacher or school counselor supports a child under 18 in changing their name, pronouns, or gender expression—known as social transition—it will be a serious crime called a Class E felony. The bill also updates rules for people required to register as sex offenders, including how and when they must update their information with law enforcement. Those affected include minors seeking social transition and adults who are convicted under this law, who may face registration requirements. The bill aims to restrict support for social transition in schools and increase monitoring of offenders.
