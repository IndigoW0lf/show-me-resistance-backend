summary: |
  This bill, HB1462, repeals a law that previously prevented cities, counties, and other local governments in Missouri from passing their own rules related to guns. Now, local governments can create regulations concerning the sale, transfer, ownership, use, and transportation of firearms, as long as these rules follow state laws and specific guidelines. The bill also clarifies that open carrying of firearms is allowed in some cases, especially if the person has a valid permit, and it limits legal actions against firearm manufacturers and dealers for their lawful activities. This legislation affects local governments, law enforcement, firearm owners, and gun-related businesses.
