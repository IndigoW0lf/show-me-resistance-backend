summary: |
  This bill, known as HB1602, updates Missouri laws on legal cases involving police officers. It states that officers who violate a person's constitutional rights under their authority can be held liable, without certain legal protections like immunity or limitations on damages. If someone sues a police officer successfully, the court can order the officer's employer to pay for their legal costs and any damages, unless the officer did not genuinely believe their actions were lawful. The bill also sets a two-year limit for filing such lawsuits. Overall, it aims to hold police officers more accountable and makes it easier for people to take legal action when their rights are violated by law enforcement.
