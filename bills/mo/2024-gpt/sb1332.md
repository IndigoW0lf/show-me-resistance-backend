summary: |
  The bill changes the way the board of trustees for the St. Louis public school retirement system is structured and how its members are chosen. It defines different groups of trustees, including those appointed by the local school district, elected active and retired members, and members appointed by the Missouri Public Charter School Association. The goal is to ensure the board is made up of qualified individuals who represent active teachers, retired members, and public charter schools. These updates affect people involved in public school employment and retirement, as well as those interested in the governance of school-related pension systems.
