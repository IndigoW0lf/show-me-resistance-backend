summary_short: "This bill proposes a constitutional change to protect and regulate firearms rights in Missouri, including rules for local gun laws and exceptions for certain officials."
summary: |
  The bill aims to amend Missouri's Constitution to explicitly affirm the right of citizens to keep and bear arms for personal defense, property, and in aid of civil authority. It states that restrictions on these rights must be carefully justified and that the state must protect against infringements. The bill also allows cities like St. Louis and Kansas City to create their own gun regulations through ordinances, including licensing and penalties, with some exemptions for law enforcement, judges, and certain security personnel. This change would update the state's firearm laws, affecting gun owners, local governments, law enforcement agencies, and courts.
