summary: |
  This bill makes it mandatory for the Missouri Department of Transportation to share key details about road work projects. When a contractor bids on construction, repair, or maintenance projects on the state highway system, the Department must publish the project's estimated cost and expected completion date online. This helps the public see what the project is expected to cost and how long it will take, promoting transparency and better understanding of government activities related to highways.
