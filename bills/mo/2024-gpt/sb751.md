summary: |
  This bill makes important changes to how health insurance companies and pharmacy managers handle certain medications. Specifically, it prohibits them from penalizing or limiting healthcare providers and pharmacies when they supply or administer medically necessary clinician-administered drugs, regardless of whether they are in-network providers. It also protects patients' ability to receive these drugs from their chosen providers or pharmacies without extra costs or restrictions. Additionally, the bill prohibits discrimination against certain drug providers that participate in the 340B Drug Discount Program, which helps ensure affordable medicines for low-income and vulnerable populations. Overall, the law aims to promote fair access and treatment for both healthcare providers and patients regarding essential medications.
