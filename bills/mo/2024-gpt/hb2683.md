summary_short: "This bill changes how the state pays for jail costs, covering expenses only after a person is convicted."
summary: |
  This bill clarifies that the state will only reimburse jails for the costs of holding prisoners after they have been convicted of a crime. It requires counties and cities to determine and report the daily cost of incarceration, and the state will pay only for the days that prisoners are convicted and legally held on post-conviction charges. The bill also sets limits on the daily cost the state will cover and updates procedures for billing and accounting these costs. It affects local government agencies, jails, and the Department of Corrections by changing how incarceration costs are calculated and reimbursed.
