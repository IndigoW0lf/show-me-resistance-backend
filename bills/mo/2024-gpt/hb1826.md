summary_short: "This bill updates rules for how authorities can confiscate neglected or abused animals and sets procedures for their care or humane killing."
summary: |
  The bill changes existing laws about taking animals away from owners who neglect or abuse them. It requires law enforcement and health officials to get a court warrant before entering private property to inspect, care for, or confiscate animals. Once animals are taken, their owners have 15 days to post bond to claim them or arrange for their care. The bill also clarifies when animals can be humanely euthanized if they are too sick or disabled to recover. These new rules aim to ensure proper procedures are followed while protecting both animal welfare and property rights.
