summary: |
  This bill, HB1596, sets new rules for rental housing in Missouri. It states that if a rental property has serious health or safety problems—such as mold, leaks, pests, or sewage issues—the landlord must fix these problems within 30 days after receiving written notice from the tenant. If the landlord doesn’t act within that time, they can be held responsible for damages, including health care costs that the tenant might incur because of the problem. After repairs are made, an inspector will check the property to ensure the issues have been properly addressed. This law helps protect tenants from unsafe living conditions and makes landlords responsible for maintaining safe, habitable homes.
