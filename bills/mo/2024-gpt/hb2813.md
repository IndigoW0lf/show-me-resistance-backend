summary_short: "This bill updates animal care standards and enforcement rules to improve animal welfare inspection and penalties in Missouri."
summary: |
  The bill changes existing laws about how animal facilities are inspected and regulated in Missouri. It requires inspections by qualified officials before a license is granted and at least once a year afterward. If violations are found, authorities can order corrections and impose fines of up to $1,000 per violation. It also allows law enforcement agencies to be notified of violations quickly and makes it easier to enforce penalties, helping ensure better animal care across the state.
