summary_short: "This bill delays court and administrative cases involving Missouri legislators while the state is in session or during certain times of the year."
summary: |
  The bill updates rules to automatically pause legal proceedings against members of the Missouri General Assembly when the legislature is in session or from January 1 to June 1 each year. This pause applies to most types of court and administrative cases, including hearings, trials, and depositions, if the legislator has formally notified the court or agency that they are involved in the case and meet specific criteria. The stay does not apply if the legislator waives it, is involved in certain types of cases like injunctive relief, or is charged with serious crimes such as felonies. The law also outlines procedures for courts to handle requests to end or modify these stays and provides that cases involving legislators can be continued during session if their attendance is necessary for a fair trial.
