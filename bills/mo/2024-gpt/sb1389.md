summary: |
  The bill updates the laws regarding how much circuit clerks in Missouri are paid. It sets their salaries as a percentage of the salary of associate circuit judges, ensuring that clerks in all counties receive a consistent percentage (62%) of the judge's pay. It also specifies that most clerks will be paid monthly by the state, but clerks in St. Louis City, St. Louis County, and Jackson County will continue to be paid by their local governments. These changes aim to make clerk salaries more standardized and transparent across the state.
