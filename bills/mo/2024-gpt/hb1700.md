summary: |
  This bill changes the rules governing how public retirement systems in Missouri manage their investments and make decisions about proxy voting. It clarifies what fiduciaries—those responsible for managing retirement fund assets—must consider when making investment choices, especially regarding social, political, or ideological goals. The bill specifies that investment decisions should primarily be based on financial factors, such as risks and returns, and limits the consideration of social or political interests unless they have a clear financial impact. It also defines terms related to investments and fiduciary responsibilities, aiming to increase transparency and ensure investment choices are made with a focus on financial prudence.
