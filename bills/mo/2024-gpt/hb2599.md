  This bill makes changes to the laws about selling and providing alcohol to people under 21. It clarifies that sellers and their employees can be exempt from penalties if they have a reasonable belief that a person buying alcohol is of legal age, using secure IDs like government-issued cards. The bill also sets new penalties for property owners who allow underage drinking on their property, especially if they do not stop someone under 21 from drinking. Overall, it aims to improve how alcohol purchases are verified and to strengthen enforcement against underage drinking.
