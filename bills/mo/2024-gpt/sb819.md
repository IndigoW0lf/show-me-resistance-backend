summary_short: "This bill creates a virtual school program in Missouri and updates rules for students in nontraditional educational settings."  
summary: |
  This legislation establishes the Missouri Course Access and Virtual School Program, allowing students under 21 in kindergarten through 12th grade to enroll in virtual, online classes. It updates existing laws about virtual education and specifies how students in these programs are counted for school funding and reporting purposes. The bill ensures that students in full-time virtual programs are included in their local school districts' attendance counts, which affects funding calculations. It also requires the virtual program to share student information with their resident districts and to notify districts when students stop participating. This affects students, districts, and state education funding in Missouri.
