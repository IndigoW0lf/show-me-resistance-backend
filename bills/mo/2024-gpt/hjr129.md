summary_short: "This bill proposes a constitutional change to allow victims of certain sexual offenses to file lawsuits at any time, without time limits."
summary: |
  The bill aims to amend the Missouri Constitution so that there is no statute of limitations for legal cases involving rape, forcible sodomy, or childhood sexual abuse. This means victims can begin legal action at any point in the future, even years after the incident. The change applies to cases against the person accused of these crimes or anyone whose wrongful conduct contributed to the victim being affected. It affects victims of these offenses, their guardians, and the legal system by removing time restrictions on pursuing justice for these serious crimes.
