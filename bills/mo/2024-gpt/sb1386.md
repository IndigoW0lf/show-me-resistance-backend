summary: |
  This bill allows individuals who drive as volunteers for non-profit organizations to receive a tax credit. If you are a volunteer driver helping a qualified organization, you can claim a credit on your state taxes for miles driven, up to $3,000 annually. The credit is 65 cents per mile and can be carried over for three years if not used all at once. The program starts in 2025 and is limited to a total of one million dollars in credits each year, with some rules set to prevent abuse. Itâ€™s designed to encourage more volunteer driving that benefits community organizations and will sunset in 2030 unless lawmakers decide to renew it.
