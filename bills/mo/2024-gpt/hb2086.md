summary: |
  This bill updates Missouri laws related to real estate and agricultural loans. It allows lenders and borrowers to agree in writing on any interest rates, fees, and loan terms for specific types of loans, including those for businesses, agricultural purposes, or real estate investments (excluding residential mortgages). It also limits certain fees that lenders can charge, such as small extension fees, late payment charges, and fees for insurance related to loans. These changes aim to provide more flexibility and clarity for loans that are not residential mortgages, affecting lenders, borrowers, and those involved in business and agricultural financing.
