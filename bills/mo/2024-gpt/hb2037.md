summary: |
  The bill makes it illegal for employers in Missouri to pay women less than men for the same type of work that requires similar skill and effort. It clarifies that wage differences can only be based on factors like experience, skill, seniority, or the quality and quantity of work, not gender. Employers cannot reduce wages or take negative actions against employees for asserting their right to equal pay. This law aims to promote fairness and prevent gender-based wage discrimination in the workplace.
