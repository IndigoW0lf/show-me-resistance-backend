summary_short: "This bill allows Bates County voters to approve a 1% sales tax to support local hospital services."
summary: |
  The bill lets certain Bates County voters decide whether to approve a small sales tax—up to 1%—that would help fund hospital operations in the county. Only counties with a specific population size qualify, and the tax would be added on top of existing taxes. If voters agree, the tax will start in the second quarter after the election. The money raised would go directly to support local hospitals, funding their services and operations. Voters can later decide to repeal the tax through a vote.
