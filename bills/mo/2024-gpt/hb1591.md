summary: |
  The bill HB1591 prohibits schools and educational programs that get state funding from discriminating against students because of their hair type or hairstyle, like braids or locks. It defines "race" to include traits like hair texture and hairstyles associated with different racial groups. This means students cannot be unfairly treated or excluded based on how their hair looks. The law applies to both public and private schools that receive state financial assistance, with some exceptions for religious organizations. The goal is to promote fairness and prevent racial discrimination related to hair in educational settings.
