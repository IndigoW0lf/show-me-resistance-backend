summary: |
  This bill makes rules for health insurance companies (called health carriers) to inform healthcare providers about important updates, like changing their address or insurance ID numbers. Providers must be notified at least 90 days before the change takes effect, ensuring they have enough time to process claims correctly. If the insurer doesnâ€™t give proper notice, they must pay all claims during the delay period plus interest and penalties. The bill also allows providers to file complaints or lawsuits if the insurer fails to follow these rules, and it outlines penalties for violations. This law helps protect healthcare providers and ensures they receive timely payments from insurance companies, with some exceptions for Medicaid programs.
