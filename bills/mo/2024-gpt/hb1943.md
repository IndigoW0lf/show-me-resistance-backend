summary_short: "This law requires off-campus outpatient hospital departments to use separate ID numbers and follow billing rules to improve transparency and prevent surprise charges."
summary: |
  This bill, called the "Honest Billing Act," makes rules to ensure hospitals and their outpatient departments bill correctly for services. Specifically, if a hospital has an outpatient department located more than 250 yards from the main hospital campus, that department must have its own unique ID number (NPI) when submitting insurance claims. This helps make sure that billing is clear and accurate. The law also makes it illegal for these departments to bill patients or insurance companies in ways that do not follow these rules. The goal is to increase transparency, prevent unexpected costs, and protect patients from being held liable for services that aren't billed properly. These rules will apply to all licensed hospitals and insurance providers in Missouri starting January 1, 2025.
