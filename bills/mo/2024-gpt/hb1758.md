summary_short: "This bill creates a special Education Stabilization Fund to help ensure public school funding remains stable and available."
summary: |
  The bill establishes the Education Stabilization Fund in Missouri's state treasury. This fund is designed to hold money that can be used to support public schools if there are shortfalls in state revenues. The governor may transfer money into this fund, and it can be used to make sure public schools stay funded as planned. Any money left in the fund at the end of a fiscal year, if it exceeds 10% of the previous year's school funding, will be transferred back to the state's general revenue fund. This helps keep public school funding steady and responsive to budget changes.
