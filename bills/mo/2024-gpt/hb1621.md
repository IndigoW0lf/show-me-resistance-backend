summary_short: "Water systems must get information from health officials and notify the public before starting or stopping water fluoridation."
summary: |
  This bill requires public water systems and districts in Missouri to consult with local health departments about the effects of fluoridating or stopping fluoridation of water before making any changes on a continuing basis. They also need to notify the Department of Natural Resources, health departments, and their customers at least 90 days before any decision to start or stop fluoridation, using various communication methods. If the required notices are not given, the water system must restore previous fluoridation levels until proper notification is provided. The purpose is to make sure communities are well-informed and that health officials are involved in decisions about water fluoridation.
