  This bill establishes the Missouri Public Administrator Fund, which will collect and hold money to support the work of public administrators in the state. The fund can be used for purchasing computer equipment, covering travel expenses for home visits, and funding training programs related to guardianships and conservatorships. It also updates laws about guardianships and conservatorships to clarify terminology and improve protections and communication rights for people under guardianship or conservatorship. The changes aim to make the management of guardianships more efficient and transparent, benefiting both public administrators and those under their care.
