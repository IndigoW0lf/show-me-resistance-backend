summary_short: "This bill updates how hospitals handle forensic exams for sexual offense victims to include telehealth support and specifies age-based procedures."

summary: |
  This bill changes the rules for performing forensic exams on victims of sexual offenses in Missouri hospitals. Starting in early 2023, hospitals must perform these exams using special evidence collection kits when victims aged 14 or older request them and give consent. For victims under 14 or those aged 14-17, the bill directs hospitals to refer them to specialized SAFE CARE providers for evaluation. It also requires hospitals to ensure examiners are properly trained and allows the use of telehealth services where trained professionals can guide onsite staff during the exam. The bill includes exemptions if hospitals face technological challenges or if the statewide telehealth network is unavailable, but such waivers are limited and temporary. These rules aim to improve the examination process, evidence collection, and support for sexual assault victims across the state.
