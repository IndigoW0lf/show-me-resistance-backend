summary_short: "This law limits federal mandates on Missouri and controls fee increases and regulations to reduce government overreach."

summary: |
  The "Big Government Get Off My Back Act" is designed to limit federal government interference in Missouri by ensuring that any federal mandates must be approved through specific processes. It also prevents the state from increasing certain fees for five years unless required by federal rules or laws passed by the state legislature. Additionally, it requires state agencies to evaluate new rules to protect small businesses and public safety, helping prevent unnecessary regulations that could burden small employers. This bill mainly affects state agencies, small businesses, and anyone concerned about overregulation and government overreach.
