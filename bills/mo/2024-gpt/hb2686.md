summary_short: "This bill sets rules for how animals suffering from parvovirus must be handled and reported by licensed animal care facilities in Missouri."
summary: |
  This legislation requires animal care facilities that manage animals infected with or exposed to parvovirus to notify the state veterinarian within one business day of diagnosing the disease. It also mandates that animals with parvovirus be isolated from healthy animals to prevent spreading the illness. Facilities found to violate these rules or pose ongoing health risks may have their licenses revoked. Additionally, these facilities must keep detailed records about the animals they acquire, sell, or euthanize, including reasons for euthanasia, and report this information to the state veterinarian each year. The rules aim to improve how animals with parvovirus are cared for and to prevent the disease from spreading or being sold unknowingly.
