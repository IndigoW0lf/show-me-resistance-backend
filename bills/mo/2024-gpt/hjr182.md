summary_short: "This bill changes voting rules in Missouri to require voters to be both U.S. citizens and residents of Missouri to vote."
summary: |
  The bill proposes amending Missouri's constitution to make it clear that only individuals who are both U.S. citizens and residents of Missouri can vote in elections. It specifies that voters must be at least 18 years old, registered if required, and have lived in their voting area for at least 30 days before the election. The bill also excludes certain groups from voting, such as those declared mentally incapacitated by a court, involuntarily committed in a mental institution, or with felony convictions related to voting rights. This change aims to ensure that only qualified citizens and residents participate in voting, impacting voters across the state and reinforcing legal eligibility requirements.
