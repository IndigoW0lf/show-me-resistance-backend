  This bill establishes an early education district in St. Louis County to offer free prekindergarten programs for four-year-olds who are not yet old enough for kindergarten. The district will be responsible for creating appropriate curriculum and may set up schools or programs to serve eligible children. Existing school districts will continue to provide services until the new district is ready to fully take over. The bill also outlines how the district will be funded and monitored to ensure quality early childhood education for young children in the county.
