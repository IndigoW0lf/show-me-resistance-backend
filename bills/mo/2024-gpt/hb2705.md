summary: |
  This bill, HB 2705, lets individuals in Missouri get a tax credit when they adopt a rescue animal from an animal shelter. The credit can be up to $125 for each qualified pet adoption, and they can claim up to two credits per year. The program is designed to encourage animal adoption and make it more affordable. There is a limit on the total amount of tax credits given out each year, capped at $500,000. The tax credit is refundable, meaning you can get money back even if your tax bill is low. However, if the adopted animal is returned, neglected, or not cared for properly, the taxpayer must repay the credit, and shelters will provide receipts to support claims. This law affects taxpayers who adopt rescue animals and animal shelters involved in the process.
