summary: |
  This bill establishes the Missouri Dignity in Pregnancy and Childbirth Act. It requires hospitals and clinics that provide pregnancy-related care to implement training programs for their healthcare workers. These programs focus on understanding implicit bias — unconscious prejudices and stereotypes — and include education on cultural identity, communication, health disparities, and reproductive justice. The goal is to reduce bias, improve communication, and promote fair, respectful care for all pregnant and birthing individuals, especially those from minority communities. The bill affects healthcare providers, hospitals, clinics, and pregnant patients across Missouri.
