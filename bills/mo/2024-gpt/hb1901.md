summary: |
  The Missouri Premium Security Plan is a new program designed to help make individual health insurance more affordable. It does this by creating a reinsurance system where the state helps cover very high claims costs for people with health insurance. The plan applies to certain health insurance providers, such as insurance companies, nonprofit health organizations, and health maintenance organizations. It affects those who buy individual health coverage by aiming to lower premiums and improve affordability through additional financial support from the state.
