summary: |
  This bill changes the way sales tax applies to food in Missouri. Starting January 1, 2025, a portion of the local food sales tax will gradually be reduced over four years. By January 1, 2029, all retail sales of food will be completely exempt from sales tax. This means that most food purchased for home use will no longer have sales tax added at the register. The bill covers food that can be bought using food stamps and food sold through vending machines. However, it does not include food sold by restaurants or places where most of their sales come from prepared, ready-to-eat meals. This change aims to make food more affordable for residents by removing sales tax on groceries.
