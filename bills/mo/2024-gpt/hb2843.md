summary_short: "This bill keeps certain government records about people's home addresses and vehicle information private for specific public safety officials."
summary: |
  This legislation changes the rules about who can see the home addresses and vehicle details of certain government and law enforcement personnel. Specifically, it protects the personal information of active or retired parole officers, federal pretrial officers, peace officers, judges, and their immediate family members from being publicly released by the Department of Revenue. Only authorized uses, such as legal requests under specific laws, can access this information. These restrictions help improve the safety and privacy of these individuals and their families.
