summary_short: "This bill allows sales tax exemptions specifically for boat docks in Missouri."  
summary: |
  This bill, HB2360, changes state laws to give a sales tax exemption for purchasing boat docks. It means that people or businesses buying docks for boats wonâ€™t have to pay sales tax on those purchases. The goal is to lower the cost for boat owners, marinas, and others involved with boat docks, making it easier and more affordable to buy and install them in Missouri. This change only applies to boat docks and does not impact other types of items or sales taxes.
