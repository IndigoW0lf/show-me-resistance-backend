  The bill requires that all water used to make ice for human consumption must come from approved drinking water sources. It also states that imported ice sold for people to eat must be made from water approved by the relevant authorities in the manufacturing state. The law mandates that ice be processed and packaged in ways that prevent contamination, including proper disposal of spills and using food-safe packaging materials. Packaged ice must be sealed tightly and include labels with the product name, weight, and manufacturer contact details. These rules aim to ensure the safety and quality of ice available to consumers in Missouri.
