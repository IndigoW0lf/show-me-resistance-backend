  This bill authorizes the Secretary of State to create and manage a website where eligible voters can submit their signatures electronically for initiative and referendum petitions. Voters can choose to sign either electronically or manually, but electronic signatures are now accepted as valid if they meet certain security requirements. The bill details what information voters must provide when using an electronic signature and establishes rules to ensure the process is secure and trustworthy. It affects voters, election officials, and government agencies involved in the petition process by making it easier and more flexible to sign petitions electronically.
