summary_short: "This bill changes the court procedures for first-degree murder cases, including how guilt and sentencing are decided."
summary: |
  The bill updates how first-degree murder trials are conducted in Missouri. It sets out a two-stage process where the jury first decides if the defendant is guilty or not, and if guilty, a second stage is used to determine the punishment. During the punishment phase, evidence for or against the death penalty can be presented, and the jury will decide whether to sentence the defendant to life imprisonment or the death penalty based on specific legal criteria. These changes affect both prosecutors and defense attorneys, as well as defendants facing first-degree murder charges.
