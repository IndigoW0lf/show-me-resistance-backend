summary: |
  This new law in Missouri will require websites that provide adult or pornographic material to verify that visitors are at least 18 years old. To do this, users will need to prove their age using government-issued ID or other trusted methods before they can access the content. The goal is to protect minors from harmful material online. Websites that do not comply could face restrictions or penalties. This affects online adult content providers, internet users in Missouri, and companies hosting such websites.
