summary: |
  This bill updates Missouri laws to limit how long certain public health orders can stay in place. It states that orders related to closing or restricting access to businesses, churches, schools, or gatherings during a declared emergency cannot last more than 30 days unless the local government approves longer stays with a majority vote. For orders issued outside a declared emergency that affect entire categories of places, the maximum duration is 21 days unless the local governing body votes to extend it with a higher majority and gets approval from the state legislature. The bill also allows local government leaders to end orders early if they choose. These rules help ensure that public health restrictions are balanced with individual and business rights during emergencies.
