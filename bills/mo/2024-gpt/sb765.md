summary_short: "This bill creates a new unit to review and investigate claims of innocence in criminal cases in Missouri."
  
summary: |
  This bill establishes a conviction review unit within the Missouri Office of Prosecution Services. The unit will investigate claims that someone was wrongly convicted, even if they pled guilty, based on new and reliable evidence of innocence. Applications for review must be sworn and have no excessive fees, and requests will only be accepted if no other legal actions are pending. The review process includes experienced attorneys, an investigator, and staff, and their findings will be shared with the relevant prosecutors. The prosecutors are not required to follow the unitâ€™s recommendations, but all records involved in the review will be kept confidential unless a decision is made to release them.
