summary_short: "This bill restricts government agencies from using automated license plate readers on public roads to protect privacy."
summary: |
  This bill makes it illegal for government agencies and local governments in Missouri to buy, install, or use automated license plate reader systems on public highways. These systems are cameras combined with computer software that record and analyze license plates, including data like location, date, and time. The only exceptions are if the system is attached to a police vehicle or if the data is accessed through certain third-party vendors following specific laws. The goal of the bill is to limit how the government can track vehicles on public roads and to improve privacy for residents.
