summary_short: "This bill creates the 'Uniform Public Expression Protection Act,' to protect peopleâ€™s rights to free speech and participation in government activities from certain legal actions."
summary: |
  The bill establishes a new law called the "Uniform Public Expression Protection Act" in Missouri. It helps protect individuals and organizations when they speak or act related to government matters or public issues. Specifically, it prevents lawsuits from being filed against people for their communication or activities during government proceedings, debates, or on public concerns, as long as those actions are protected by the U.S. or Missouri constitutions. However, it does not apply to lawsuits involving government officials acting officially, law enforcement actions to protect public safety, or communications related to selling goods or services. The law also sets procedures for quickly dismissing inappropriate legal claims and pauses other court actions until certain motions are decided. This bill mainly affects individuals, groups, and government entities involved in free speech and public participation.
