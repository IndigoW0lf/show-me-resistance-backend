summary_short: "This bill makes it easier for certain people to have their criminal records closed or expunged after a specific amount of time without needing to petition."

summary: |
  The bill sets new rules for when and how criminal records can be automatically closed or expunged in Missouri. Starting August 28, 2026, many types of criminal cases—such as certain misdemeanors, infractions, and some felony cases—will be closed without the person needing to file a formal request. The time that must pass before records can be closed depends on the type of offense: one year for some violations, three years for misdemeanors, and five years for felonies. The law aims to give eligible individuals easier access to having their criminal history records sealed after they’ve demonstrated good behavior over time.
