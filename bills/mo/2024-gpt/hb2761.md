summary: |
  The bill changes the existing law on unlawful firearm possession. It states that a person can be charged if they knowingly have a firearm and they have a felony conviction, are a fugitive, are intoxicated or mentally incompetent, or are under 18 and on public property. There are some exceptions, such as if a minor has completed a hunter education course. Depending on the circumstances, unlawful possession can be a serious crime with penalties that vary from a Class D to a Class C felony. This law affects anyone in Missouri who might be caught with a firearm under these conditions, including convicted felons, fugitives, minors on public property, and others.
