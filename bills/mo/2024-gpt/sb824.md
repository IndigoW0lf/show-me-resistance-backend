summary: |
  This bill, called the Missouri Returning Heroes' Education Act, helps military veterans who have served in combat by offering special tuition discounts at public colleges and universities in Missouri. Combat veterans can pay only $50 per credit hour if they maintain good grades, and this applies for up to ten years after leaving the military. For graduate programs, they can pay no more than 30% of the tuition costs for up to twenty years after their discharge. Additionally, colleges can receive up to one million dollars annually from the gaming commission fund to help cover these tuition reductions. The bill aims to support veterans in continuing their education by making it more affordable.
