summary_short: "This bill proposes changes to Missouri’s jury trial rules, including allowing smaller juries in civil cases and letting defendants choose to waive their jury trial with approval."
summary: |
  This bill aims to update Missouri’s constitution regarding jury trials. It allows courts to use smaller juries in civil cases and for a majority of jurors to decide civil cases, instead of a unanimous vote. It also lets defendants in criminal cases choose to waive their jury trial and have their case decided by a judge instead. These changes are meant to give more flexibility in how jury trials are conducted, while still protecting the right to a jury trial.
