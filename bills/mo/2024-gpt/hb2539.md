summary: |
  This bill adds a law in Missouri that prohibits people from possessing an open container of alcohol inside the passenger area of a vehicle when it is on public streets, highways, or roads. If someone is found with an open alcohol container in the passenger part of the car, they can be fined for this violation. The law applies whether the person is driving or just riding in the vehicle, but it does not include areas like locked glove compartments or spaces behind seats that are not normally used for passengers. This rule is meant to help prevent drinking alcohol while in vehicles on public property and to promote safer roads.
