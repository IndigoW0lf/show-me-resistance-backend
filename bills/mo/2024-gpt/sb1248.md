summary: |
  This law changes how hospitals and healthcare professionals handle peer reviews and quality improvement activities. It requires hospitals to provide necessary medical records and documentation to health authorities; if they do not, the hospital could lose its status as a trauma, STEMI, or stroke center. The bill also clarifies that activities related to quality improvement are protected as peer reviews, which helps ensure honest assessments without fear of legal issues. These updates mainly affect hospitals, healthcare providers, and the health department involved in emergency and specialized care.
