summary_short: "This bill allows teachers in Missouri to earn credit toward their salary by participating in supervised externships at local businesses, with a system to recognize these experiences as equivalent to graduate coursework."

summary: |
  The bill updates Missouri law to let teachers gain practical work experience through externships at businesses, supervised by their school districts. These externships can now be recognized as equivalent to some graduate-level college credits, which can help teachers qualify for higher salaries. The Department of Economic Development and the Department of Elementary and Secondary Education will establish requirements and a schedule for how externships translate into college credit hours. Schools that pay teachers based on graduate credits will need to count externship completion as equivalent to those credits. This aims to encourage teachers to gain real-world experience and improve their skills, benefiting both educators and students.
