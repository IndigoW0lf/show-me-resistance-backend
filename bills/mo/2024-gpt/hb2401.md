summary_short: "This bill eliminates the sales tax on food in Missouri and proposes tax increases to make up for the lost revenue, pending voter approval."

summary: |
  This bill removes the sales and use tax on food, meaning food will no longer be taxed when purchased in Missouri. To compensate for the revenue that will be lost from not taxing food, the bill suggests increasing certain other taxes, but these increases will only happen if voters approve the changes. The bill also updates rules for assessing property values for taxes, affecting how much property owners pay, and requires regular property assessment plans. It impacts residents, property owners, and local governments by changing how sales tax and property taxes are calculated and collected.
