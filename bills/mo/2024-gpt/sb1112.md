summary: |
  The bill updates the rules for allocating state money to regional planning groups across Missouri. It requires local units to provide half of the funding for their projects and sets specific maximum amounts the state will contribute to each region. These funding limits are adjusted each year based on the Consumer Price Index. The goal is to ensure fair and predictable support for regional planning efforts while involving local contributions.
