summary_short: "This bill updates rules for handling emergency medical services data to protect privacy and allow research collaboration in Missouri."

summary: |
  This bill changes how information related to emergency medical services (EMS) is handled in Missouri. It keeps complaints, investigation reports, and personal records confidential unless the person involved gives permission or law enforcement is involved. Certain basic information about licensed EMS providers and training organizations will no longer be kept secret. The bill also allows the Department of Health to work with the University of Missouri to study EMS data for public health research, while keeping personal health details private. These changes aim to improve data privacy and support research to improve emergency healthcare.
