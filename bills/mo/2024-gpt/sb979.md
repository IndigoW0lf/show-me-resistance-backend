summary_short: "Allows large charter cities in Missouri to annex nearby areas within six miles with owner approval, and sets rules for fire tax collection after annexation."

summary: |
  This bill gives certain large cities in Missouri, specifically those with populations between 160,000 and 200,000 people, the ability to expand their city boundaries by adding nearby areas within six miles, if the owners of all properties in those areas agree. Cities can do this through official petitions signed by property owners. After annexation, the fire protection district continues to collect taxes for that year, but the city will gradually reduce its payments to the fire district over four years. This change impacts property owners, city governments, and fire districts by clarifying how annexation and tax sharing will work for these large cities.
