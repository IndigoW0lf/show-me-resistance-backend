summary: |
  This bill changes the rules for the Police Retirement System of St. Louis. It states that if a member of the retirement system dies, their surviving spouse can now be considered a member for voting and election purposes. This means spouses of police retirees can participate in selecting the trustees who oversee the retirement system. The bill also updates how the Board of Trustees is made up and specifies that trustees can serve as long as they are in office, with some travel allowances for Trustee duties.
