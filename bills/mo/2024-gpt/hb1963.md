summary_short: "This law updates what optometrists can do and clarifies restrictions on surgeries they are allowed to perform in Missouri."

summary: |
  This bill changes and clarifies the rules for optometrists in Missouri. It expands their allowed activities to include eye exams, diagnosing and treating eye conditions, prescribing medications (except injections), removing superficial foreign bodies, and performing certain eye surgeries that are non-invasive or limited to pre- and post-surgical care. However, it specifically restricts optometrists from performing major surgical procedures like laser eye surgery, corneal transplants, and surgeries involving incisions into the eye or surrounding tissues, except in pre- and post-operative situations. The law aims to clearly define the scope of practice for optometrists and ensure patient safety by limiting more invasive eye surgeries to ophthalmologists.
