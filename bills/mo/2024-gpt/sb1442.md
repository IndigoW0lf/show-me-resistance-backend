summary_short: "Public utilities cannot prevent customers from suing or participating in class actions against them."

summary: |
  This bill makes it clear that utility companies cannot include rules in their service agreements that stop customers from suing them in court or joining class action lawsuits. It ensures people can still take legal action if they need to, whether through regular court, small claims court, or arbitration. The law applies only to investor-owned utilities regulated by the Public Service Commission. This helps protect consumers' rights to seek justice if they have issues with their utility provider.
