summary_short: "This bill updates how Missouri calculates state funding for public schools to ensure fairer and clearer methods."
summary: |
  The bill revises the rules for determining how much state aid public schools in Missouri receive. It changes the way the "average daily attendance" is calculated, including summer school students and children attending different districts, to make funding more accurate. It also clarifies what counts as "current operating expenditures" for the purpose of funding, especially for the 2007 fiscal year, and sets limits on how much the funding calculations can increase annually. Overall, these changes aim to improve transparency and fairness in distributing state funds to school districts.
