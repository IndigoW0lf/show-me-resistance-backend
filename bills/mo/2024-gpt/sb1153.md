summary: |
  This bill requires the Department of Elementary and Secondary Education to conduct safety assessments of every public and charter school in Missouri. These assessments will look at school vulnerabilities, such as risks of shootings or intruders, and evaluate safety measures like security doors, cameras, visitor systems, alarms, communication tools, and safety policies. After the assessments, schools will receive reports highlighting their safety issues and suggested improvements. The bill ensures that schools stay focused on creating secure environments for students and staff, while not replacing existing safety laws and standards.
