summary: |
  This bill creates clear guidelines for investigating firefighters, both paid and volunteer, who are suspected of misconduct. It requires that firefighters be informed in writing about the details of the investigation before questioning and sets rules about when and how the interrogation takes place. The goal is to ensure investigations are conducted fairly, respecting the rights of firefighters, and to improve transparency during these processes. This will affect fire departments, emergency services personnel, and law enforcement authorities involved in firefighter investigations.
