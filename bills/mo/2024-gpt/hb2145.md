summary: |
  This bill changes existing laws so that rules about students' participation in school sports, based on whether they are male or female, no longer have a time limit. It specifies that students must compete in sports designated for their biological sex, as shown on their birth certificate or official government record, unless no appropriate category is available. The bill also states that schools violating these rules could lose state funding and that students or parents harmed by violations can seek legal action for relief. Overall, it aims to clarify and enforce participation based on biological sex in school athletic competitions.
