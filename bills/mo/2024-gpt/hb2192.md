summary: |
  The bill introduces new rules for people who drive vehicles pulled by animals, such as horse-drawn carriages. It requires these vehicles to have specific lights and reflectors for visibility, especially during dawn and dusk or when lighting is needed. Drivers must have front white lights and rear red lights or reflectors that can be seen from a distance to help other drivers see them clearly. Additionally, the bill mandates flashing lights and reflective materials for night-time operation to further ensure safety for everyone on the road. These changes aim to make animal-driven vehicles easier to see, reducing accidents and increasing safety for drivers, passengers, and animals alike.
