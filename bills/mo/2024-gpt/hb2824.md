summary: |
  This bill updates Missouri's laws regarding the sale and purchase of drugs that contain ephedrine, pseudoephedrine, or phenylpropanolamine. It sets new limits on how much of these substances a person can buy or sell within a single day, a 30-day period, and over a year. For example, an individual cannot buy or receive more than 3.6 grams in one day or more than 43.2 grams in a year. The bill also requires that these drugs be sold only from behind a pharmacy counter by trained pharmacy staff, and pharmacies must report their sales of these products regularly. These changes aim to prevent these medications from being used to make illegal drugs while still allowing proper medical access.
