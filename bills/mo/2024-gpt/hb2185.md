summary: |
  This bill changes the laws around assisted reproduction, such as artificial insemination and the use of donated semen. It clarifies when a person is legally recognized as a parent, including cases where semen is donated by someone other than the child's intended parent. The bill states that if a woman is inseminated with donor semen, and her partner gives written consent, that partner is treated as the child's legal parent. It also specifies that semen donors are generally not considered legal parents unless there is a prior written agreement. These updates help establish clear legal rights and responsibilities for all parties involved in assisted reproduction, affecting couples, donors, and medical providers.
