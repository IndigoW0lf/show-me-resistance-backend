summary: |
  This legislation updates existing traffic laws to specify that drivers must stop when approaching railroad crossings if any on-track equipment, such as maintenance or repair vehicles, is present, not just trains. It sets clear rules for drivers to stop between 15 and 50 feet from the tracks and to ensure the crossing is clear before proceeding. The bill also reinforces safety measures around crossing gates and signals to prevent accidents. These changes aim to improve safety for all road users and on-track workers, impacting drivers of personal and commercial vehicles, as well as railroad operators.
