summary_short: "This bill changes the rules for how local government entities in Missouri can buy liability insurance for tort claims, including the coverage limits and how immunity is waived."

summary: |
  This bill modifies the way political subdivisions, like cities and counties, purchase liability insurance to cover claims made against them for damages or injuries. It specifies that these entities can directly buy insurance from an insurance company, but sets maximum coverage limits of two million dollars for all claims from a single incident and three hundred thousand dollars for any one person. The bill also clarifies that the state and local governments only waive sovereign immunity up to the amount of insurance purchased and that no punitive damages can be awarded in these cases. Additionally, it ensures that if total settlement amounts exceed the coverage limits, courts can apportion the damages fairly among claimants. The law's coverage limits are adjusted annually based on inflation. Overall, the bill aims to clarify how government bodies can protect themselves against liability claims and set clear financial limits on claims.
