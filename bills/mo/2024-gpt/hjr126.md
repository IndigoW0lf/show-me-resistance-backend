summary_short: "This bill proposes a constitutional change to update Missouri's property tax laws and establish new rules for exemptions and revenue replacement."
summary: |
  The bill requests voters to approve a constitutional amendment that repeals certain existing property tax laws and replaces them with new rules. It outlines which types of property, such as homes used as a homestead by disabled veterans, industrial inventory, and religious or charitable property, can be exempt from taxes. The bill also requires that any revenue lost from these exemptions be compensated through a countywide tax on certain types of property, with adjustments made to ensure local governments still receive necessary funds. This change affects property owners, local governments, and organizations that own property eligible for exemptions.
