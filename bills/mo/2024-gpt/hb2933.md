summary: |
  The bill changes the rules about sexual abuse in the second degree. It makes it a crime to intentionally touch someone sexually without their permission, and also makes it illegal for a foster parent to have sexual contact with a foster child. The penalties are increased, with most offenses being classified as serious crimes, and it clarifies that a foster child's consent does not make such contact legal. This bill aims to better protect victims and hold perpetrators accountable.
