summary: |
  This bill proposes a constitutional change in Missouri that would make abortion illegal except in cases where it's necessary to save the life of the pregnant woman due to a medical emergency. It defines abortion very broadly and adds penalties for performing abortions outside of these emergency circumstances. The bill also allows for possible tax credits to support organizations that assist pregnant women and families, including pregnancy resource centers. It primarily affects pregnant women, medical providers, and organizations that support families in Missouri.
