summary: |
  The bill updates Missouri law to specify what voter information election authorities can share and how they must handle it. It limits public access to detailed voter data, allowing only certain information like voter ID numbers, names, and addresses for specific election purposes, and prohibits sharing online or for commercial use. Election officials are required to record voter history and share certain data with the state system after elections. These changes primarily affect election officials, political campaigns, and parties who request voter lists, ensuring more privacy and controlled access to voter data.
