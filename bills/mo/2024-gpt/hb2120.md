summary_short: "This bill creates a three-year pilot program to help families pay for nursing care for their adopted children or wards when care was insufficient."
summary: |
  This bill sets up a special program in Missouri to assist parents and guardians who care for adopted children or wards with nursing needs. If a child or ward receives private nursing services through Medicaid and they were not getting the full amount of care they needed, the family can apply to receive a lump-sum payment. This payment is based on the unused nursing hours during a period of inadequate care. The program aims to support families in providing the necessary nursing care for their loved ones and improve their well-being.
