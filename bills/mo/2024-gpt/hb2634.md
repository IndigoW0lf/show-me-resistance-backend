summary: |
  This bill makes it illegal to use government or taxpayer money to fund abortion clinics or any of their affiliated organizations. It also clarifies rules about how Medicaid (called MO HealthNet in Missouri) pays for healthcare services, such as hospital stays, outpatient care, and nursing home services. The changes aim to restrict publicly funded abortion services and set new standards for health care funding and provider enforcement in the state. These rules affect taxpayers, healthcare providers, Medicaid recipients, and clinics involved in reproductive health services.
