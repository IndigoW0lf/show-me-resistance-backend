summary_short: "This bill sets up a program to expand access to alternative therapies like hyperbaric oxygen therapy for veterans with PTSD or traumatic brain injuries."

summary: |
  This bill creates the "Veterans Traumatic Brain Injury Treatment and Recovery Act" to help veterans who have PTSD or brain injuries get alternative treatments, such as hyperbaric oxygen therapy. It allows certain health facilities to provide these therapies and be reimbursed by the state veterans' commission if the veterans have been diagnosed and have sought previous treatment. The goal is to improve recovery options for eligible veterans by including therapies outside of standard medical treatments.
