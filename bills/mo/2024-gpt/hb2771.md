summary: |
  This bill eliminates the local sales tax on the retail sale of food in Missouri, meaning you wonâ€™t pay extra local tax when buying food. It also defines which types of food are included, specifically those that can be used with food assistance programs like SNAP benefits. However, it does not apply to food sold by restaurants, fast food places, or places where most sales are for immediate consumption. Overall, it helps make groceries cheaper for shoppers by removing local taxes on most food purchases.
