summary: |
  The bill makes several changes to the way children involved in court cases are represented. It requires courts to appoint specific attorneys called client-directed counsel to represent children in many types of juvenile and family law proceedings, starting before the first court hearing. These attorneys will have access to all relevant case information and records, and they will represent the child's best interests throughout the case, including during appeals. The bill also clarifies when a guardian ad litem (a person appointed to investigate and advocate for a child's best interests) should be appointed, especially in cases of abuse or neglect, and allows judges to appoint guardians ad litem at their discretion. Overall, the measure aims to improve legal representation for children and ensure their needs are properly considered in court.
