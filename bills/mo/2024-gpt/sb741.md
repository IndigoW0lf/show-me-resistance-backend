summary: |
  This bill revises the laws about how big water companies can buy smaller water or sewer providers in Missouri. It sets clear definitions for what counts as a large or small water utility based on the number of customers they serve. When a large water utility wants to buy a small one, the bill creates a process to fairly appraise the value of the small utility, involving three independent appraisers. The goal is to make sure the purchase price is fair and transparent, protecting consumers and ensuring proper valuation during acquisitions.
