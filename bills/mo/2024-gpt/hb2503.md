summary: |
  This bill gives counties and municipalities in Missouri the ability to add a local use tax, which is a tax on goods used or stored within the area. However, they can only do this if the voters in that area approve it in an election. The use tax would be set at the same rate as the existing local sales tax, and any changes to the sales tax rate would also automatically change the use tax rate. This change is designed to help local governments raise funds for services while giving residents a say through voting.
