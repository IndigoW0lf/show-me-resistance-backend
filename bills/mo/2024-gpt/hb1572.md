summary_short: "This bill updates the rules for how counties in Missouri can appoint their health officers."

summary: |
  The bill allows county commissions in Missouri to appoint a qualified, licensed physician as their county health officer for one-year terms. If a position becomes vacant, the commission can appoint someone to fill the spot temporarily until a new officer is chosen. It also makes clear that counties are responsible for paying the health officerâ€™s salary and expenses, but they are not required to have a health officer if they choose not to. This affects county governments and their processes for managing public health officials.
