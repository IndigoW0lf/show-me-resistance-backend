summary: |
  This bill requires local school districts in Missouri to get written parental consent before making certain changes to a child's special education plan. These changes include initial placements, annual reviews, moving the child to a different location, removing or changing services, or increasing or decreasing service time by more than 25%. Schools must keep records of parental consent and provide a form in the parentâ€™s native language. Parents also have the right to visit classrooms or programs before giving consent, ensuring they are involved in their child's education decisions. The bill aims to protect parents' rights and make sure they are fully informed and involved in their child's special education planning.
