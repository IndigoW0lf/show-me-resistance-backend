  This legislation updates Missouri laws regarding the minimum time that certain felony prisoners must serve. It applies to offenders with previous prison commitments and specifies different minimum release times based on the number of past commitmentsâ€”ranging from 60% to 90% of their sentence. The bill aims to ensure that repeat offenders serve longer portions of their sentences before being eligible for parole or conditional release. It does not affect the governor's powers or certain other sentencing rules, only focusing on specific felony cases and repeat offenders.
