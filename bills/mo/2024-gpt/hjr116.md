summary_short: "This proposed amendment allows Kansas City Public Schools to keep their property tax revenue steady while shifting some taxpayer protections under Missouri law."

summary: |
  This bill suggests changing the Missouri Constitution so that Kansas City Public Schools can maintain their current property tax revenue for funding schools, even if they move residents' tax protections. Essentially, it gives the district more flexibility to set and keep their property tax rates without needing voter approval for certain increases, as long as they stay within the limits established under the new rules. This change would help Kansas City Public Schools manage their funding more predictably and could impact taxpayers and school district finances in the area.
