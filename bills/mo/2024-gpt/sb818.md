summary_short: "This bill updates how the Department of Health and Senior Services makes and enforces rules to protect public health."

summary: |
  The bill changes existing laws to clarify that the Department of Health and Senior Services can create, change, and enforce rules necessary to perform its duties, but these rules must follow specific legal processes. It states that the department cannot delegate or give authority to create rules to other agencies or officials. The bill also emphasizes that the department's rules are meant to protect public health, including preventing the spread of diseases, and it specifically requires the department to include certain antibiotic-resistant infections like MRSA, VRE, and CRE in its reporting list. These updates mainly affect how the department develops health regulations and who has the authority to do so, ensuring rules are made transparently and responsibly.
