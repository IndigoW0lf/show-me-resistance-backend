summary: |
  This bill allows people in Missouri to choose to be put on a list that temporarily restricts their ability to purchase firearms. To do this, individuals need to fill out a form at their local court and have their identity verified. Once on the list, licensed firearm dealers must check this list through the national background check system before selling a gun to that person. The process is voluntary, meaning no one is required to be on the list, but it provides a way for individuals to limit their own access to firearms if they choose.
