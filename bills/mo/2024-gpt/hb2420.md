summary: |
  The bill changes how Missouri school districts decide when to start the school year. It allows districts to choose their opening date no earlier than 14 days before Labor Day, but districts can only start earlier if they follow certain rules and hold public meetings. The bill also updates attendance requirements, including the minimum number of school days or hours needed each year. Some districts, like those with charter schools or year-round schools, are not affected by these start date rules. Additionally, districts that do not follow these rules may lose part of their state funding. The bill aims to give districts more flexibility while ensuring transparency and accountability.
