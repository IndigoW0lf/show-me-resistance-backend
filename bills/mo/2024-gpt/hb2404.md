summary: |
  This bill changes the laws regarding absentee ballots that are rejected for various reasons, such as missing signatures or invalid signatures. When a ballot is rejected, the election officials must notify the voter and tell them how to fix the problem before a deadline. Voters who receive a rejection notice can submit a special statement and identification to correct their ballot, allowing it to be counted if they meet all other requirements. The goal is to improve transparency and give voters a fair chance to have their absentee ballots accepted and included in the election results.
