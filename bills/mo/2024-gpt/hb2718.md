summary: |
  This bill updates the laws concerning records of offenders in the custody of the Missouri Department of Corrections. It makes most offender records public, but keeps some private, such as medical histories and security reports. The bill also allows offenders or their representatives to request and receive electronic copies of their medical records at no cost. It regulates who can access certain records to protect privacy and restricts the use of offender information for commercial or political purposes. These changes aim to improve transparency while safeguarding sensitive information.
