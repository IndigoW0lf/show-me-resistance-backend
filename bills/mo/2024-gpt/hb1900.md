summary_short: "This bill protects students from discrimination based on protective hairstyles at educational institutions receiving state funds."

summary: |
  This bill, called the Missouri CROWN Act, makes it illegal for educational institutions that receive state financial assistance or serve students who receive state financial aid to discriminate against students wearing protective hairstyles like braids, locks, afros, or curls. It means students cannot be unfairly treated or excluded because of their natural hair textures or styles associated with race. The bill allows schools to require hair coverings or safety hair practices in technical courses but does not apply to religious schools if their beliefs conflict with these requirements. This law helps promote fairness and respect for cultural hair styles in schools.
