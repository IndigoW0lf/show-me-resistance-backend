summary_short: "This bill updates Missouri laws to clarify how utilities can acquire land through condemnation if landowners and the utility cannot agree on compensation."
summary: |
  This bill changes the rules in Missouri for utility companies, such as those providing electricity, gas, or pipelines, when they need to acquire land for projects like power plants, pipelines, or lines. If landowners and the utility cannot agree on how much money should be paid for the land, the utility can go to court to get the land condemned (forced to sell). The bill also specifies how the court should handle these cases, including involving impartial commissioners or juries to decide fair compensation, and how to handle properties with unknown or nonresident owners. It affects landowners, utility companies, and others involved in land use for public utilities.
