summary: |
  This legislation makes it clear that anyone convicted of specific crimes related to campaign funds or criminal offenses related to their job duties becomes unfit to hold public office or employment in Missouri. Such individuals must be removed from their positions, and their appointing officials can also be subject to removal if they knowingly keep unfit persons. Additionally, the bill restricts retirement benefits for employees convicted of serious felonies connected to their work, especially crimes involving stolen money or property valued at over $5,000. The law aims to promote integrity in government by ensuring that those who commit certain crimes cannot serve in public roles or benefit from public retirement plans.
