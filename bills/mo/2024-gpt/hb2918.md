summary_short: "This bill adjusts how school districts' state aid is calculated when their revenue sources increased due to certain taxes in 2005."

summary: |
  This bill applies to school districts in Missouri that, during the 2005 fiscal year, collected revenue from specific taxes like intangible taxes, merchant and manufacturer surcharges, or payments in lieu of taxes. Because these revenues made the district’s "local effort" figure appear higher than it would have been otherwise, the bill requires the Department of Elementary and Secondary Education to recalculate the district’s state aid as if those revenues had been placed in other funds, like the capital or debt service funds. The corrected calculation will then be used for all state aid decisions from August 28, 2024, onward. This change helps ensure districts are not unfairly rewarded or penalized based on revenue sources that temporarily inflated their local effort figures.
