summary: |
  This bill makes changes to Missouri's laws about liquor wholesalers. It bans wholesalers from giving special discounts or favors to certain retailers, except for small discounts for quantity or early payment. It also states that delivery charges must be included in the price of the liquor, and not charged separately. The bill allows manufacturers and wholesalers to donate liquor for charitable, religious, or educational purposes, as long as it is not resold and certain records are kept. These updates aim to improve fairness and transparency in the alcohol distribution system and affect wholesalers, retailers, charities, and religious groups.
