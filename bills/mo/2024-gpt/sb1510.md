summary: |
  This bill updates Missouri law to ensure that driver’s and non-driver’s licenses issued to U.S. citizens clearly indicate their citizenship. It sets standards for the design and materials of the licenses to prevent forgery and includes a requirement for a digital facial image to be incorporated. The bill also specifies what information must be on the license, such as name, date of birth, address, and a signature. It affects both adults applying for licenses and existing license holders, including members of the military who receive temporary licenses. Overall, it aims to improve identification clarity and security for license holders and law enforcement.
