summary_short: "This law protects your reproductive and sexual health information from being shared or sold without your permission and limits government access."
summary: |
  This bill creates new rules about how digital services that provide reproductive or sexual health information can handle your data. It states that these services cannot share, sell, or use your information without your clear permission each time. Additionally, government agencies cannot ask these services for your information unless it's for serious criminal investigations, and even then, only under specific conditions. The goal is to give people more control over their sensitive health information and ensure their privacy is protected.
