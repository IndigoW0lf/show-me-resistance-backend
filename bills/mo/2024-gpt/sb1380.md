summary: |
  This bill modifies the rules around tax credits for certain types of farm projects aimed at increasing access to fresh food. Specifically, it provides tax credits to individuals, businesses, or organizations that invest in setting up or improving urban farms or small farms in areas called food desertsâ€”places where residents don't easy access to a full-service grocery store. The new law defines what counts as an eligible farm, specifies the kinds of expenses that qualify, and limits the amount of tax credits that can be claimed. It helps promote local food production in underserved areas and encourages private investment to improve access to healthy foods for people living in food deserts or urban areas.
