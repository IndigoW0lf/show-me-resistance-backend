summary: |
  This bill updates the rules for funding early childhood education programs in Missouri, focusing on children ages three to five who qualify for free and reduced-price lunch. It allows these young children to be counted in their school district's average daily attendance, which helps determine funding. The bill also specifies how school districts can fill enrollment spots if a child leaves a program mid-year without losing funding. Starting in 2024-25, the state will provide additional funding to districts and charter schools based on the number of eligible young children who attended pre-kindergarten the year before they would start kindergarten. These changes aim to support early childhood education and ensure schools receive appropriate funding for these young learners.
