summary_short: "This bill changes rules about taxes used to fund services for people with developmental disabilities in Missouri cities and counties."

summary: |
  This bill updates existing laws to clarify how local governments in Missouri can levy taxes to support services like sheltered workshops, housing, and related care for individuals with developmental disabilities. It allows cities and counties to seek voter approval to collect taxes—up to four mills for counties and two mills for cities—to fund these programs. The money collected must be kept in special funds and used only for the purpose of supporting these services, following specific guidelines. The bill affects local government agencies, voters, and organizations that provide services for people with developmental disabilities.
