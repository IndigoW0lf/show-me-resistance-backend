summary_short: "This bill removes the requirement for county and city political committees to hold meetings at the county seat, allowing them to meet at different locations."
summary: |
  This bill changes the rules for county and city political committee meetings. Previously, these meetings had to be held at the county seat or a designated place within the city. Now, the law no longer requires meetings to be held at the county seat, giving committees more flexibility to choose their meeting locations. This affects county and city political parties by allowing them to hold meetings elsewhere within the area, potentially making it easier for members to participate.
