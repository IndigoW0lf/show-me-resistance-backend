summary: |
  This bill makes changes to Missouri's income tax rates by updating how much residents pay based on their income. It also introduces a new tax on the endowments (money saved for future use) of qualifying colleges and universities in the state. The goal is to ensure wealthy institutions contribute more and to adjust tax rates over time based on state revenue. These changes could affect residents' tax bills and the financial contributions of some higher education institutions, promoting fairer funding for public priorities.
