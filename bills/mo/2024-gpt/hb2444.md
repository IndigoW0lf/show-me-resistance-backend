summary_short: "This bill sets new rules for how school districts in Missouri can join existing special school districts through a voter-approved process."
summary: |
  The bill establishes procedures for school districts to attach or join adjacent special school districts. It requires districts wanting to attach to create a special district first, and for districts wanting to be annexed, it mandates a voter vote after petitions are signed. The process includes publishing notices and voting on whether to proceed with the annexation. If approved, changes are certified and new governance structures are formed, especially for larger districts. The bill affects school boards, voters in school districts, and the organization of special school districts across Missouri.
