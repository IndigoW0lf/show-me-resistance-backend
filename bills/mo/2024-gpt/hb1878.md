summary_short: "This bill requires all firearm sales and transfers to go through a licensed dealer, including private and online transactions."
summary: |
  The bill mandates that anyone transferring a firearm in Missouri, whether through a private sale, online interaction, or estate transfer, must do so through a licensed firearms dealer. If neither person involved is a licensed dealer, they must work with one to process the transfer, which includes performing a background check and following all legal requirements. This applies to individuals, estates, and trusts, with certain options available to transfer firearms legally. The bill aims to make firearm transfers safer and more regulated, affecting gun owners, sellers, and estate representatives.
