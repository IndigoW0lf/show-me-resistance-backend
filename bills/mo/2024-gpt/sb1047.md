summary_short: "This law requires health insurance plans in Missouri to cover genetic testing and counseling for breast and ovarian cancer risk starting in 2025, without extra costs to patients."

summary: |
  Starting in 2025, all health insurance plans in Missouri must include coverage for genetic counseling and testing related to the BRCA1 and BRCA2 genes, which are linked to breast and ovarian cancer risk. This means people at increased risk — based on their personal or family history — can access these services and tests without having to pay out-of-pocket costs. Insurance companies are not allowed to consider these genetic test results when deciding about coverage, premiums, or other benefits. The goal is to make cancer risk assessments more affordable and accessible, helping more people understand their health risks early on.
