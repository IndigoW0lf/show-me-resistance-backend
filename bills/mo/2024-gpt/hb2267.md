summary: |
  This legislation creates rules to ensure that health insurance companies and pharmacy benefit managers cannot unfairly limit or penalize doctors, pharmacies, or patients when it comes to medically necessary drugs that are administered by healthcare providers. It aims to prevent restrictions such as denying approval, paying less, charging higher copays, or interfering with a patient’s choice of provider or pharmacy for these drugs. The bill also includes provisions related to the coverage of certain specialty drugs under the 340B program, making sure those drugs are accessible and fairly managed. Overall, it helps protect patients’ access to necessary medications and supports fair treatment from insurers and pharmacy services.
