summary_short: "This bill creates a statewide licensing system for mechanical contractors in Missouri to improve regulation and oversight."
summary: |
  The bill establishes the Missouri Statewide Mechanical Contractor Licensing Act, creating a new system for licensing contractors, journeymen, and apprentices in the mechanical trades, such as HVAC, piping, and fuel systems. It sets clear definitions for these roles and regulates the work performed under state licenses, ensuring that mechanical work meets safety and quality standards nationwide. Local licenses will still be valid, but a statewide license will provide a consistent credential across Missouri, affecting contractors, workers, and companies in the mechanical industry by standardizing licensing requirements and enforcement.
