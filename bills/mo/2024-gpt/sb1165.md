summary: |
  This bill updates how Missouri classifies and regulates marijuana and certain drugs. It removes an old law and creates new rules for treating marijuana under the law. Specifically, it clarifies which substances are considered highly dangerous and have no accepted medical use, meaning they are illegal to possess or sell. The bill also includes a detailed list of other drugs, mostly opioids, that are classified as illegal under Schedule I. These changes affect law enforcement, healthcare, and anyone involved with controlled substances in the state.
