summary: |
  The proposed legislation rewrites parts of Missouri law concerning guardians ad litemâ€”people appointed by the court to represent the interests of children or certain incapacitated individuals in legal cases. It clarifies when and how guardians are appointed in cases of child abuse or neglect, including situations involving minors and mentally ill or otherwise incapable parents. The bill also sets requirements for agencies and law enforcement to share relevant information with guardians, ensuring they have the necessary details to represent the child's best interests. Additionally, it gives judges more authority to evaluate and appoint qualified guardians, including background checks, to enhance the safety and well-being of children involved in court proceedings.
