summary: |
  The bill aims to update Missouriâ€™s constitutional rules about how many years a person can serve in the state legislature. Currently, it limits service to 8 years in one house and 16 years total in both houses. The new rules, which would take effect after December 2028, set a maximum of 16 years in total, regardless of how those years are split between the House and Senate. This change allows some lawmakers to serve longer in one house, but the overall service period remains capped. The bill also clarifies how past service before the law takes effect will be counted. If voters approve this change, it will impact current and future state legislators by setting new limits on their time in office.
