summary_short: "This bill proposes a constitutional amendment in Missouri to strengthen gun rights and allow local governments to regulate firearms through ordinances."
summary: |
  This bill suggests changing Missouri's Constitution to clearly affirm the right of every citizen to keep and bear arms, ammunition, and related accessories for personal and property defense, as well as when called upon by authorities. It also states that any restrictions on these rights must undergo strict scrutiny, meaning they will be examined carefully to ensure they do not infringe on constitutional rights. Additionally, the bill allows cities and counties like St. Louis and Kansas City to create their own laws to regulate firearms, issue permits, and set penalties for violations. These local ordinances can include fees and permit validities, and they will recognize permits issued by other jurisdictions, affecting gun owners, law enforcement, and government entities.
