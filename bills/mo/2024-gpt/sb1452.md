summary_short: "This bill requires political campaigns to disclose their use of political consultants and related services."

summary: |
  This bill updates Missouri law to require political campaigns and committees to publicly reveal information about their political consultant services. It mandates detailed reporting on campaign receipts, expenditures, and sources of contributions, including contributions over $100, anonymous contributions, and in-kind donations. Campaigns must also report loans received and provide information about contributions from individuals and organizations. The goal is to increase transparency by making it easier for the public to see who is financially involved in political campaigns and what services they use.
