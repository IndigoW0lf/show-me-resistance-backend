summary_short: "This bill allows law enforcement officers to deduct a percentage of their income from Missouri state taxes, starting in 2025."
summary: |
  The bill grants certain law enforcement officers, including Missouri patrol members, peace officers, and federal law enforcement personnel working in Missouri, a special tax deduction. Starting with the 2025 tax year, officers can deduct a percentage of their salary or retirement income—up to 100% by 2028—based on the year. The deduction applies to income included in federal taxes and is intended to reduce the amount officers owe Missouri in state taxes. This change aims to provide tax relief to law enforcement personnel who serve in the state.
