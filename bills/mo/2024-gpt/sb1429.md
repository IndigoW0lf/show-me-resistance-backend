summary: |
  This law requires blood banks in Missouri to test all donated blood for signs of COVID-19 vaccines or other mRNA vaccines, including components like spike proteins and lipid nanoparticles. If the blood tests positive for these, it must be labeled clearly to show this status. Hospitals and clinics cannot use or transfer this blood for transfusions unless it has been properly labeled and patients have been informed they can refuse it. The goal is to ensure transparency and give patients the choice to decline blood that may contain vaccine components.
