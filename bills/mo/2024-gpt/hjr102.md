summary: |
  This bill proposes changes to how citizens can put laws or amendments on the ballot in Missouri. It clarifies that initiatives cannot be used to create or raise taxes on food or property, or to allocate money except from new revenue sources. The bill also bans foreign governments or political parties from sponsoring, funding, or making contributions related to initiative petitions. Additionally, it adjusts the approval process for constitutional amendments so they need majority support both statewide and within a majority of House districts. These changes aim to increase transparency and limit foreign influence on state initiatives.
