summary: |
  This bill makes changes to the laws governing parole and court-imposed sentences in Missouri. It clarifies that parole can only be granted after an offender has served their minimum sentence and requires the parole board to conduct risk and needs assessments before considering release. The bill also defines how parole hearings should be conducted, including personal interviews and victim rights, and gives the Division of Probation and Parole new authority to charge fees that help fund community correction services. These updates impact offenders, parole officials, and the legal system by setting clearer rules for release and support services.
