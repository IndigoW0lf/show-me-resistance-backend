summary: |
  The "Preserving Freedom from Unwarranted Surveillance Act" sets rules for the use of drones and other unmanned aircraft in Missouri. It bans law enforcement agencies from using drones to gather evidence or observe people without a warrant, except during emergencies like fires or rescues. The law also requires private property ownersâ€™ consent before a drone can be flown over their land or used to monitor them. These measures aim to protect individual privacy while allowing limited emergency use, affecting law enforcement, government agencies, and private citizens.
