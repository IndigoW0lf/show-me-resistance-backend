summary: |
  The "Foreign Adversary Divestment Act" is a law that directs Missouriâ€™s state and local government investment funds to stop holding investments in certain foreign countries and companies. These include countries like China, Russia, Iran, North Korea, Cuba, Venezuela, and Syria, or any others the governor designates. The funds must sell any investments they hold in these foreign adversaries or related companies within two years. This affects public pension funds, local government investment pools, university endowments, and other state-controlled financial assets, ensuring they no longer profit from or support adversaries of the United States.
