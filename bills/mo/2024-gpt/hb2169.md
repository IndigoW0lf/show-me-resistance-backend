  The bill sets a rule that correctional centers and jails cannot charge inmates more than five cents per minute for domestic phone calls. It applies to both prisons and jails in Missouri. The law also clarifies that these rules do not require facilities to provide free phone access to inmates, only to keep costs low if they choose to offer phone services. This aims to make phone calls more affordable for inmates and their families.
