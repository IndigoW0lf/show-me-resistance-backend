summary_short: "This bill updates the rules for homeschooling in Missouri, including what counts as a home school and what records parents need to keep."
summary: |
  This bill changes Missouriâ€™s laws about homeschooling to clarify what a home school is and what requirements parents must meet. It defines a home school as one that mainly provides religious or private instruction, enrolls children age 7 or older (but not over the district's compulsory age), and does not charge tuition. Parents must keep records of coursework and provide at least 600 hours of instruction, including specific subjects, unless the child is 16 or older. The bill also states that maintaining these records and following the rules is only reviewable by local prosecutors and that a parent can use a daily log or written statement as a defense if questioned. These changes primarily impact parents who homeschool their children and local authorities overseeing education compliance.
