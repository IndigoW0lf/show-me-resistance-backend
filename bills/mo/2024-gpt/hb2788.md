summary_short: "This bill creates a new law called the 'Uniform Community Property Disposition at Death Act' to clarify how community property is handled after someone dies in Missouri."

summary: |
  This bill establishes rules for managing and distributing community property — the assets owned jointly by spouses or partners — when someone passes away. It defines key terms like "community-property spouse" and explains how property that is considered community property will be treated, even if it’s stored electronically or held in different ways. The law applies to all types of property, whether real estate or personal items, and covers situations whether the person who died lived in Missouri or elsewhere. This helps ensure that the property rights of spouses are clear and consistent across different cases and jurisdictions in Missouri.
