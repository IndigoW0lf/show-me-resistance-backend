summary_short: "This law creates rules to protect the physical privacy of minors in public school restrooms, locker rooms, and shower rooms based on their biological sex."

summary: |
  This bill requires public schools to provide separate areas for minors based on their biological sex to ensure privacy and safety. It states that students must use locker rooms, showers, and restrooms designated for their own biological sex, but if a studentâ€™s gender identity differs from their biological sex, they can request alternative accommodations with parental permission. Schools that do not follow these rules could lose state funding and be considered unaccredited until they comply. The law affects students, parents, and school district officials by setting clear guidelines for privacy and bathroom use in schools.
