summary_short: "This bill updates the fees collected by the Missouri Emergency Response Commission for six years starting in 2024, affecting certain businesses that handle hazardous chemicals and petroleum products."

summary: |
  The bill repeals the previous fee law and replaces it with new rules for collecting fees related to emergency response. It requires businesses that report hazardous chemicals—excluding local governments and family farms—to pay an annual fee, which varies based on their activities with petroleum and hazardous substances. Petroleum-related businesses can deduct federal transportation fees from their state fees. The bill also sets specific fee limits and establishes deadlines for payment, with penalties for late submissions. These changes mainly impact certain chemical and petroleum businesses operating in Missouri and aim to fund emergency response efforts.
