summary: |
  The bill changes the rules in Missouri about using physical and deadly force for self-defense. It allows individuals to defend themselves or others if they reasonably believe they are facing unlawful force. The bill clarifies situations where deadly force is justified, such as protecting against unlawful entry into homes or vehicles. It also states that people don't have to retreat before defending themselves in certain places like their home or private property. These new rules aim to make self-defense laws clearer and protect the rights of individuals in dangerous situations.
