summary_short: "This bill prohibits government entities from discriminating against businesses based on their environmental, social, and governance (ESG) scores."
summary: |
  The bill makes it illegal for the state, its agencies, and local governments to treat businesses differently because of their ESG scores. ESG scores evaluate how companies or organizations handle energy use, social contributions, employee wages, environmental policies, anti-corruption policies, and transparency. This means that businesses cannot be unfairly favored or penalized during government contracts or registration based on these scores. The goal is to promote fair treatment for all businesses regardless of their ESG practices.
