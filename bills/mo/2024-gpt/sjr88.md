summary_short: "This bill removes time limits for suing in cases of certain sexual offenses in Missouri."
summary: |
  The bill proposes changing the state's Constitution to ensure there is no deadline to file a lawsuit related to specific sexual crimes. This includes cases of rape, forcible sodomy, or childhood sexual abuse, even if many years have passed since the incident. It allows victims or their guardians to bring legal action at any time, regardless of how much time has gone by. This change aims to give victims more opportunity to seek justice, regardless of when the crime was committed.
