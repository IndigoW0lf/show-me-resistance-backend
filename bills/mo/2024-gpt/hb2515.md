summary_short: "This law bans discrimination based on hair texture and protective hairstyles in Missouri schools that receive state funding."

summary: |
  This bill, known as the Missouri CROWN Act, makes it illegal for educational institutions that receive state financial aid to discriminate against students or staff because of their natural hair or hairstyles associated with their race, like braids or afros. It aims to protect individuals from unfair treatment related to their hair in schools such as public and private elementary, secondary, and pre-kindergarten programs. While schools can still require safety hair coverings for certain technical classes, the law mainly ensures people are treated fairly regardless of their hair style. It does not apply to religious schools if the rules conflict with religious beliefs. The bill is designed to promote fairness and respect for cultural hair practices in educational settings.
