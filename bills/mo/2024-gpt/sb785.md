summary: |
  The bill modifies the Missouri Works program by replacing certain existing sections with new rules. It sets clear definitions for terms like "average wage," "commencement of operations," and "employee," which help determine how companies qualify for tax incentives. The changes include rules for measuring wages, identifying when a company starts its project, and clarifying which workers count towards incentive criteria. These updates are designed to make the program more transparent and ensure that support is given to businesses that create quality jobs for Missouri workers.
