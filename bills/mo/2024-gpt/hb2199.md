summary_short: "This bill changes which government has authority over certain lands in Missouri, giving more control to the federal government in some areas."

summary: |
  The bill updates the rules about who has jurisdiction over specific lands in Missouri. It states that land owned and used by the federal government, such as the honor farm associated with a federal prison, will be under federal control. It also gives the federal government authority over the Ozark National Scenic Riverways as long as the U.S. maintains and manages that area. However, certain watersheds, like the White River and Osage and St. Francois Rivers, are excluded from these changes. This bill mainly affects land management and local governance in these areas.
