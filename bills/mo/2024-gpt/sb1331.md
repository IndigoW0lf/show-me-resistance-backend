  This bill makes it a crime for an alien to enter Missouri while they are in violation of federal immigration laws, specifically 8 U.S.C. Section 1325. If someone is caught entering the state illegally, they could face a fine of up to ten thousand dollars and be ordered to leave the state. Repeat offenders could be charged with a more serious crime called a class E felony and face additional penalties. The bill also provides procedures for removal, allows law enforcement to arrest individuals suspected of illegal entry, and sets rules about how and when those individuals can be removed from Missouri.
