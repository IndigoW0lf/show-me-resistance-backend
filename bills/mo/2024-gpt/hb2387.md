summary_short: "This bill creates a program allowing some low-income and vulnerable residents to use SNAP benefits at certain restaurants."

summary: |
  The bill establishes a "Restaurant Meals Program" as part of the Supplemental Nutrition Assistance Program (SNAP) in Missouri. This program lets eligible households, such as seniors, disabled individuals, and homeless people, use their SNAP benefits to buy meals at private restaurants that participate in the program. The goal is to make it easier for these vulnerable groups to access nutritious food, especially if they have difficulty preparing meals at home. Restaurant owners can choose to participate by contracting with the department to offer meals at reduced prices for those who qualify.
