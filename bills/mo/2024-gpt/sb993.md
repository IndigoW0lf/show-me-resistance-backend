summary: |
  The bill changes the rules about earnings taxes in Missouri. It caps the tax rate at 1% for wages, salaries, business profits, and other earnings. Starting in 2025, cities that are not within a county can slowly lower their tax rates by small steps each year—each reduction being one-tenth of a percent—if their revenue increases enough. The bill also creates a special reserve fund to help cities recover revenue if reductions cause shortfalls and gives officials the ability to refund excess money if the fund has more than needed. Overall, this bill affects city governments, workers, businesses, and taxpayers by potentially reducing local earnings taxes over time while managing revenue impacts carefully.
