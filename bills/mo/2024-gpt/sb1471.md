summary_short: "This bill lets landlords separately bill tenants for water and sewer services using meters or formulas, without being considered utility providers."
summary: |
  This legislation allows landlords and property owners to charge tenants directly for water and sewer services in rental properties. They can do this either by installing separate meters for each tenant or by using a mathematical formula to fairly split the costs among tenants. The bill also requires clear disclosure of how charges are calculated and ensures that tenants are billed only for the actual amount of water and sewer they use, not more than what the utility charges the owner. Additionally, landlords can add reasonable administrative fees or late payment fees, which tenants will be informed about beforehand. This change impacts rental property owners, tenants, and utility billing providers, making water and sewer charges more transparent and fair.
