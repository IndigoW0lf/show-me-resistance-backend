summary_short: "This bill shortens the time limit for filing certain legal actions from five years to three years."

summary: |
  The bill changes the time a person has to take legal action in court for certain issues. Specifically, for most contract-related cases, property trespass, personal injury, or theft, people now have only three years to file a lawsuit instead of five. However, for fraud cases, victims can still bring a claim within ten years after discovering the fraud. This affects anyone involved in these legal matters by reducing the time they have to act in court.
