summary: |
  This bill establishes a new dedicated fund called the "Pretrial Witness Protection Services Fund" to support safety measures for witnesses involved in criminal cases. It allows law enforcement agencies and prosecutors to offer protection, including housing and health services, to witnesses who may be at risk of harm due to their testimony. The bill also authorizes the Department of Public Safety to approve expenses related to providing secure housing and protective services, ensuring that vulnerable witnesses and their families can be kept safe before their trials. These measures are intended to encourage witnesses to come forward and testify without fear of retaliation, making the justice process more effective and secure for everyone involved.
