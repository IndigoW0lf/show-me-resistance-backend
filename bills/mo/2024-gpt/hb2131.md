summary_short: "Requires that any written request for money clearly state it's a solicitation, not a bill, with prominent disclaimers."  
summary: |
  This bill makes it illegal for anyone to send a written request for payment that could look like a bill, invoice, or statement of account unless they include a clear and obvious warning that it is actually a solicitation and not a bill. The warning must be easy to see and read, using large, bold, and contrasting text, and must be placed on every relevant page or part of the document. If a company or individual does not follow these rules, they can be fined and the person harmed can seek damages three times the amount they were asked to pay. The goal is to protect consumers from confusion and possible scams by ensuring that solicitations are clearly marked as such.
