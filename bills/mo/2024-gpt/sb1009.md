summary: |
  This bill changes how property values are assessed for tax purposes in Missouri. It reduces the percentage of the true value of real estate that the assessor uses to determine property taxes, which can lower the amount property owners owe. The bill applies to all counties in the state, including St. Louis, and makes adjustments to assessment procedures, especially for new construction and improvements. Its goal is to make property taxes fairer and potentially less burdensome for property owners in Missouri.
