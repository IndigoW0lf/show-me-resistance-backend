summary_short: "This law protects employers from legal liability when they hire ex-offenders, unless the ex-offender has committed certain serious crimes."
summary: |
  This bill, called the "Civil Liability for Employers Hiring Ex-Offenders Act," helps protect employers from being sued if they hire someone with a criminal background. Employers won't be held responsible for hiring an ex-offender unless that person was convicted of specific serious crimes, like certain felonies involving violence or fraud. The law also states that if an employee was convicted of a nonviolent, non-sexual crime before being hired, that cannot be used as evidence against the employer in most cases. However, the law does not prevent lawsuits if an employer fails to supervise an employee properly or if they knew about the ex-offenderâ€™s convictions and that crime is related to their work. This law aims to encourage fair employment without exposing employers to unnecessary legal risks when hiring ex-offenders, except in cases involving serious offenses.
