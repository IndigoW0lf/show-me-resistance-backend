summary_short: "This bill changes the rules for handling absences and establishing a quorum in the Senate."
summary: |
  The bill amends Senate Rule 8 to clarify procedures when senators are absent. It allows the Senate to call the names of senators, note who is absent, and potentially take absent senators into custody if they do not provide sufficient excuses for missing sessions. The goal is to ensure that enough senators are present to conduct official business, and it includes provisions for handling absences and establishing a quorum. This affects all current and future senators by providing clearer rules on how absences are managed and how the Senate can respond to insufficient attendance.
