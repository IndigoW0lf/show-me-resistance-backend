summary: |
  This bill makes changes to Missouri's laws about school bus driver licenses. It revises how long licenses are valid based on the driverâ€™s age, such as 6-year licenses for most adults and shorter periods for younger and older drivers. It also streamlines licensing rules for drivers of different age groups and clarifies requirements for license renewal and endorsements. The goal is to improve safety, flexibility, and clarity for school bus drivers and the Department of Revenue responsible for issuing these licenses.
