summary_short: "This bill updates pesticide registration and labeling rules in Missouri to ensure proper registration, renewal, and labeling requirements for pesticides sold or used in the state."

summary: |
  This bill requires that all pesticides sold, distributed, or transported within Missouri must be registered with the stateâ€™s Department of Agriculture. Registrants need to provide information about their product, including labeling and claims, and pay an annual fee of $200 per product. Renewals are required each year, and a late fee applies if renewal is delayed past January 1st, unless the registrant can prove they didn't distribute the pesticide during that time. The money collected helps fund programs that oversee pesticides and ensure safe use, benefiting the agriculture industry and protecting public health and the environment.
