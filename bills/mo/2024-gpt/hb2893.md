summary: |
  The bill makes changes to the laws governing Missouri empowerment scholarship accounts, which provide financial aid to certain students attending private or special education programs. It clarifies who qualifies for these scholarships, including students with disabilities and children from low-income households, and specifies the types of schools that can participate, such as private, charter, and virtual schools. The bill also states that participating schools are not controlled by the government and cannot discriminate based on race, religion, gender, or other protected characteristics. It affects families who wish to use scholarship funds for their childrenâ€™s education outside public schools and sets rules for how schools accepting these funds operate.
