summary: |
  The bill changes Missouri laws to require utility companies such as gas, electric, water, and sewer providers to get permission from the Public Service Commission before starting new construction projects. Specifically, they need approval before building major infrastructure like power plants or transmission lines that carry electricity over 230 kilovolts. They also need approval to use certain franchises or rights granted by the government. The purpose is to ensure that construction and use of utility systems are necessary for the public and properly reviewed. This affects utility companies and aims to increase oversight and transparency in utility expansion projects.
