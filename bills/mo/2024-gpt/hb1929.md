summary: |
  The bill updates Missouri law to require the stateâ€™s Division of Mine Inspection to inspect all caves open to the public at least once a year. It sets the inspection fee the cave owners must pay to the state at $70 per year, replacing the previous $35 fee. The bill also clarifies that owners and operators must notify the state before opening the cave and ensure safety measures like guard rails and proper electrical installations are in place. Once inspected and fees are paid, owners will receive an inspection certificate to display at the cave entrance, helping ensure public safety and proper regulation.
