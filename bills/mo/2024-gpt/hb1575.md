summary_short: "This bill exempts small local governments with fewer than 500 residents from fines for late financial report submissions."

summary: |
  The bill changes current rules so that small political subdivisions, such as tiny local government units with fewer than 500 people, won't be fined if they submit their annual financial statements late. These reports show how the government is managing its money each year. The law still requires most governments to send these reports to the state auditor, but small ones will no longer face daily fines for delays. This law mainly affects small local governments and aims to reduce the penalty burden on them while ensuring financial transparency.
