summary_short: "This bill allows courts to grant divorce or legal separation even if one spouse is pregnant."
summary: |
  This legislation clarifies that being pregnant does not prevent a court from granting a divorce or legal separation. It updates the rules for when and how courts can decide to dissolve or legally separate a marriage, considering whether the marriage is irretrievably broken or still salvageable. The bill applies to cases in Missouri and affects spouses, children, and family law proceedings by ensuring pregnancy status isn't a reason to block divorce or separation judgments.
