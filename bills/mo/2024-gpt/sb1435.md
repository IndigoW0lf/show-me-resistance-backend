summary_short: "This bill updates rules about who can serve as election judges in Missouri, especially regarding military members and their spouses."

summary: |
  The bill changes Missouri law to specify that military members on active duty and their nonresident spouses can serve as election judges. It also sets new rules about who is eligible to be an election judge, requiring them to be registered voters or military personnel, and limiting conflicts of interest, such as serving as an election judge if a relative's name appears on the ballot. The bill aims to clarify eligibility requirements and ensure proper participation of military-connected individuals in election processes. These changes will take effect starting January 1, 2025, and primarily affect election officials, military members, and their families in Missouri.
