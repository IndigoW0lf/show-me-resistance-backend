summary_short: "This bill updates how Missouri funds its tourism promotion efforts by creating a dedicated revenue fund and changing funding rules."
summary: |
  This bill, known as SB1456, redefines the way Missouri manages its tourism funding by establishing a new special fund called the "Division of Tourism Supplemental Revenue Fund." The fund will hold money from state appropriations, gifts, grants, and other sources, and will be used solely for the Missouri Division of Tourismâ€™s activities. It also sets rules about how much money is deposited into this fund each year, based on previous appropriations and certain sales taxes related to tourism. These changes aim to improve funding stability for tourism promotion without having leftover money automatically revert to the general state revenue, affecting how tourism projects are financed in Missouri.
