summary_short: "This bill updates Missouri's marriage laws, including age requirements and the process for obtaining a marriage license."
summary: |
  The bill amends existing laws about marriage in Missouri by replacing certain sections with new rules. It clarifies that a valid marriage requires obtaining a license beforehand, which can now be applied for online or in person. It also introduces provisions allowing individuals who are incarcerated or serving active military duty outside the state to apply for a marriage license by submitting sworn affidavits and necessary identification. These changes aim to make it easier for more people, including those in service or prison, to legally marry under Missouri law.
