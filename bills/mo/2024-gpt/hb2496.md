summary_short: "Allows certain cities and counties in Missouri to impose a tourist tax on hotel stays, but only if voters approve it."

summary: |
  This bill gives specific cities and counties in Missouri the ability to create a special tax on hotel or motel stays to support local tourism efforts. These taxes can be up to 5% of the room charge and can only be implemented if local voters approve it through an election. The tax money collected must be used solely for promoting tourism in that area. Not all cities or counties can impose this taxâ€”only those that meet certain population and size criteria, and it cannot be added if similar taxes are already in place elsewhere in the area.
