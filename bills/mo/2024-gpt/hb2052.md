summary: |
  This bill makes changes to Missouri's election laws, mainly focusing on how voters register and how election officials manage voter lists. It states that most adults in Missouri who are at least 17 and a half years old can register to vote and will remain registered for six years unless they update their information. The bill also clarifies who cannot vote, such as those who are incarcerated, on probation or parole after a felony conviction, or have been convicted of certain crimes. Additionally, election officials will now send voters information cards and verification notices before elections to help ensure voters stay informed and registered voters are prepared to vote.
