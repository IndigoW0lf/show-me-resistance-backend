summary: |
  This bill changes the rules for cities in Missouri that collect taxes on earnings. Starting September 30, 2024, these cities must prepare and publish quarterly reports showing how much earnings tax they collect, broken down by residents' zip codes, refunds paid, and taxes related to remote work. It also sets new rules for how remote work is taxed, stating that earnings from remote work are only taxable if the work is performed in the city itself, beginning in 2025. Taxpayers who believe they are wrongly taxed for remote work outside the city can now take legal action to get refunds, with the possibility of class-action lawsuits. Additionally, cities must create a process for residents to request refunds for taxes paid on remote work performed outside the city, making this information accessible on their websites.
