summary_short: "This bill updates Missouri's child care reimbursement rules to base payments on enrollment rather than attendance and creates a new program for easier access to transitional child care benefits."
summary: |
  This bill changes the way the state funds child care. Instead of paying based on how often a child actually attends care, payments will now be based on the childâ€™s enrollment status. It also creates a new program that allows families to easier access transitional child care benefits without needing to first qualify for full benefits. This program is designed to help families with higher incomes receive some support, with the amount of aid depending on their household income. The changes aim to make child care assistance more flexible and accessible for families in Missouri.
