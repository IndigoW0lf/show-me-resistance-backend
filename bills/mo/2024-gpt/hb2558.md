summary: |
  This bill changes how the state of Missouri helps pay for the cost of keeping people in jail. When someone is sentenced to prison or held for certain legal reasons, the state will reimburse counties or cities for the days that person spends in jail. The maximum payment per day is $37.50, and the reimbursement is subject to budget approval. The bill also explains how counties and cities can submit claims for reimbursement and who is responsible for certifying jail days. It affects local governments that operate jails, as well as the Department of Corrections which manages the reimbursements, to ensure proper funding for jail costs related to sentenced offenders.
