summary: |
  This bill makes new rules for the treatment of gold and silver by the state, including allowing the state treasurer to keep some gold and silver in the treasury and keep part of it in interest-bearing bank accounts. It also changes how residents' income tax is calculated by adding certain types of refunds and interest income to their federal adjusted gross income, with some specific exceptions. These changes affect both state financial management and income tax reporting for individuals living in Missouri.
