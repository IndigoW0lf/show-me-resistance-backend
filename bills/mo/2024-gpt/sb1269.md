summary_short: "This bill bans the use of automated photo red light cameras at intersections in Missouri."
summary: |
  The bill, SB1269, stops cities, counties, and other government areas in Missouri from using cameras and sensors to automatically catch drivers running red lights. Any local government that has the authority to issue traffic violation notices cannot install or operate these photo enforcement systems at intersections. This means that enforcement for running red lights must be done through traditional police methods, not automated cameras.
