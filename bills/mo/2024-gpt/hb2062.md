summary_short: "This bill prevents local governments from stopping or delaying eviction cases unless authorized by state law."

summary: |
  The bill states that counties, cities, or other local government areas in Missouri cannot put a moratorium on eviction proceedings unless the state explicitly allows it. This means local authorities can't temporarily pause eviction cases without special permission from the state government. The purpose is to ensure that eviction rules are consistent across the state and prevent local actions that could interfere with property rights.
