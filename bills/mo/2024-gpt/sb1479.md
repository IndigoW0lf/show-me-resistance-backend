summary_short: "This bill modifies how the state calculates funding for certain school districts based on specific revenue sources from 2005 onward."

summary: |
  This bill states that if a school district received revenue from things like intangible taxes and certain surcharge payments in 2005, its "local effort" calculation for state funding will be adjusted. The Department of Elementary and Secondary Education will recalculate this "local effort" figure as if those revenues had been placed in more traditional funds like capital projects or debt service. This revised calculation will be used to determine state aid payments starting after August 28, 2024. The purpose is to ensure fairer funding amounts for districts that received certain revenue types in 2005, affecting how much state money they get for education.
