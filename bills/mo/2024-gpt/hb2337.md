summary_short: "This bill updates Missouri's child care laws by clarifying licensing requirements and exemptions for certain types of child care providers."
summary: |
  The bill changes the rules for child care facilities in Missouri. It requires most child care providers to have a written license from the Department of Elementary and Secondary Education to operate or advertise their services. However, it also creates specific exemptions, such as for caring for six or fewer children, certain religious and educational programs, and temporary or occasional care. These updates help define which providers need licensure and which are exempt, affecting many different types of organizations and individual caregivers.
