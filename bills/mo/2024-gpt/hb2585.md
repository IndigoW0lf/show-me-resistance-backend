summary: |
  This bill changes the laws about pensions for blind adults in Missouri. It sets new rules for who can receive a pension, including limits on property ownership and restrictions on holding a driver's license. Specifically, eligible individuals must have limited property value, cannot have a valid driver's license (unless surrendered), and cannot operate a motor vehicle. It also excludes people living with a spouse who can support them if the spouse earns enough. The bill also clarifies rules for people in institutions and those who solicit for charity. These changes aim to better identify who qualifies for the pension and ensure the program is used appropriately.
