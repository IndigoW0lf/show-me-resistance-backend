  The bill, called the "Commercial Financing Disclosure Law," updates existing laws to make sure that businesses and lenders clearly share details about certain types of commercial financing transactions. It defines key terms, such as what counts as a financial account and what kinds of transactions are covered. The law applies to situations where a business gets money through loans or sells its accounts receivable at a discount. It aims to help businesses understand what they are agreeing to and prevent misleading or confusing financing practices, benefiting both businesses and lenders in Missouri.
