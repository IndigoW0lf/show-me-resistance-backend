summary_short: "This bill proposes an amendment to Missouri's Constitution to expand property tax exemptions for disabled veterans and certain other organizations."

summary: |
  The bill aims to change the Missouri Constitution to specify which properties are exempt from property taxes. It increases the scope of tax exemptions to include real estate used as a homestead by disabled veterans, particularly those with a 100% service-connected disability. It also clarifies that property used for religious, educational, charitable, agricultural, horticultural, or veteran organizations can be exempt from taxes by law. These changes would require voter approval in the 2024 election before taking effect. The bill directly affects disabled veterans, veteran organizations, religious and charitable groups, and local government revenue.
