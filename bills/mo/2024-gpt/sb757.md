summary: |
  This bill changes the rules for closing large electric power plants in Missouri. If a utility company wants to shut down a thermal power plant over 100 megawatts, it must first confirm that it has added an equal or larger amount of reliable electricity capacity with new or existing power sources. The company must also ensure that the new power sources are connected to the grid and ready to deliver electricity before closing the old plant. This helps prevent power shortages and keeps electricity reliable for residents and businesses. The bill applies to utility companies operating in Missouri and aims to protect consumers during power plant closures.
