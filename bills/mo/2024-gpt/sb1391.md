summary_short: "This bill changes the tax credit program for educational scholarships and allows certain counties to operate charter schools in Boone, St. Charles, and St. Louis."
summary: |
  This bill updates Missouriâ€™s education scholarship program, giving taxpayers a tax credit for contributions to educational assistance organizations that support students' scholarships. The credit can be up to 100% of their donation, but cannot exceed half of their total state tax liability, and it can be carried forward for four years. Additionally, the bill permits charter schools to open and operate in Boone County, St. Charles County, and St. Louis County, providing more educational options for families in these areas. The goal is to increase funding and flexibility for school choice and support students' access to private or specialized education.
