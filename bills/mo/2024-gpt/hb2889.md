summary_short: "Schools in Missouri must create policies to prevent students from using personal electronic devices during classes, with some exceptions."
summary: |
  This bill requires public schools and charter schools in Missouri to develop rules that prohibit students from using personal electronic devices like phones during classes. Schools must include these rules in a written policy, which explains when devices can and cannot be used, what penalties may happen if students break the rules, and any special allowancesâ€”such as emergencies or instructional purposes. The policies must be posted online for everyone to see. School staff are protected from liability if they follow these rules in good faith. The goal is to create a safer and more focused learning environment for students and staff.
