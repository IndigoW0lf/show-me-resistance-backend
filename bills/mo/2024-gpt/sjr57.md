summary: |
  This bill proposes a constitutional amendment that allows crime victims to pursue a civil lawsuit against the person who hurt them, within the same time frame as the criminal case for the same crime. It also affirms victims' rights to be present at court proceedings, be informed about case developments, seek restitution, and receive protection. The amendment applies to victims of all crimes, including those involving juveniles, and ensures they have access to justice both criminally and civilly. The change affects crime victims, their access to legal recourse, and the criminal justice process in Missouri.
