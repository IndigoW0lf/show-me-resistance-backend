summary: |
  This bill changes Missouri law to restrict ownership of agricultural land by foreigners and foreign businesses. Starting on August 28, 2024, no new acquisitions of farm land by foreign entities will be allowed. Existing owners who acquired land before this date cannot sell or transfer it to anyone else after that date. The bill also requires that any proposed transfers after August 28, 2024, be reviewed by the Missouri Department of Agriculture at least 30 days before finalizing, to ensure they comply with the new restrictions. The goal is to limit foreign control over farmland in the state, affecting current landowners, potential buyers, and the Department of Agriculture responsible for overseeing the rules.
