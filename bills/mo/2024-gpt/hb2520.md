summary_short: "Missouri will seek federal funds to create mobile mental health units that travel to communities and provide mental health education and services."
summary: |
  This bill requires the Missouri Department of Mental Health to apply for a federal grant to fund a statewide program of mobile mental health units. These units are specially equipped vehicles that will visit different communities to promote mental health awareness, provide important information about mental health and substance use, help people find and access behavioral health services, and encourage participation in health events. The program aims to make mental health support more accessible across Missouri, especially in areas that may lack easy access to clinics or other healthcare facilities. Local public health agencies will work with the department to set up and operate these mobile units, benefiting residents needing mental health support and reducing stigma around mental illness.
