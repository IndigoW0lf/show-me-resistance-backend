summary_short: "This bill makes it a serious crime to deliver controlled substances that cause great bodily harm or death."
summary: |
  This bill creates new laws in Missouri that make it illegal to deliver or give out controlled substances if someone gets seriously hurt or dies from using them. If a person delivers drugs and someone is injured, they could be charged with a felony that can lead to jail time. If someone delivers drugs and that results in a person's death, the person who delivered the drugs could face even harsher penalties. The goal is to hold drug dealers accountable when their actions cause serious harm or death.
