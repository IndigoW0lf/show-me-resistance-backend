summary_short: "This bill removes restrictions on paying people to help with voter registration, but sets new rules for registering as a voter registration solicitor."

summary: |
  The bill changes the law so that paying individuals to solicit voter registration applications is no longer prohibited. However, it introduces new requirements for anyone who is paid or compensated for collecting large numbers of voter registration forms. These individuals must register with the Secretary of State, provide specific personal and payment information, and take an oath that their details are accurate. This affects organizations and individuals who assist with voter registration, ensuring there are clear rules for those who are paid to do this work while maintaining transparency and accountability.
