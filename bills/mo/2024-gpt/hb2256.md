summary_short: "This bill changes the law to set a 10-year time limit for suing someone for sexual conduct causing personal injury to an adult."
 
summary: |
  The bill updates Missouri law to state that people can only file a lawsuit within 10 years after the incident if they experienced sexual conduct that caused personal injury as an adult. Previously, the law's rules about time limits may have been different. This change means that adult victims of sexual conduct now have a decade to take legal action, which could affect how and when they seek justice. The law applies to cases where the person who caused the harm is related or closely connected to the victim, such as family members or others in close relationships.
