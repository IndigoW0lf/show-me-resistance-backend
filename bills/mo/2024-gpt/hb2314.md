summary_short: "This bill sets up a process for the Missouri government to create long-term contracts with architecture, engineering, and land surveying firms for multiple projects."
summary: |
  The bill allows the Division of Facilities Management within the Missouri government to establish "master agreements" with firms that provide architecture, engineering, or land surveying services. These are ongoing contracts that can be used for various projects over a period of up to two years, with a total value of no more than one million dollars per year. The process for selecting firms involves a qualification-based method, focusing on experience, past performance, and local knowledge. This new system makes it easier to work with trusted firms for small to medium projects that need similar services repeatedly. It mainly affects government agencies, service providers, and the public by improving efficiency and transparency in state contracting.
