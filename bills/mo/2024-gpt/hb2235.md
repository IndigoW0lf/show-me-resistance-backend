summary: |
  This bill makes sure that members of the Missouri National Guard, when called into active duty by the governor, have the same job protections and legal rights as those under federal law. It applies both to Guard members called into service by Missouri and those from other states when called into Missouri duty. The bill also requires employers to display notices informing employees of their rights. If someone believes their rights have been violated, they can file a lawsuit or seek help from the Missouri Attorney General or the Employer Support of the Guard and Reserve. Overall, it helps Guard members focus on their service without fear of job loss or discrimination.
