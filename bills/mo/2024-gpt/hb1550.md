summary_short: "This bill sets new rules for the safe manufacturing and packaging of ice for human use in Missouri."
summary: |
  The bill requires that all water used to make ice for people must come from approved drinking water sources. It also applies to imported ice, which must be made from approved source water from the country of origin. The law ensures that ice is processed and packaged in ways that prevent contamination, and any spills during manufacturing or handling must be properly disposed of. Packaged ice must be sealed in containers that are protected from dirt and contamination, with clear labels showing the product name, weight, and manufacturer information. These rules aim to protect public health by ensuring the ice sold for human consumption is safe and properly labeled.
