summary: |
  This bill changes the law to extend the definition of emergency vehicles to include certain vehicles operated by state, county, or municipal park rangers, as well as other authorized enforcement and public safety vehicles. It clarifies the rules for drivers when they see or approach such vehicles, requiring them to yield right-of-way, move to the right side of the road, and stop until the emergency vehicle passes. The changes aim to improve safety for emergency and law enforcement personnel, including park rangers, by making their vehicles more clearly recognized as emergency vehicles on the road.
