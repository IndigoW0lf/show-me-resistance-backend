  The bill modifies the laws about establishing local improvement districts in Missouri. It sets new requirements for property owners to sign petitions to create these districts, such as owning more than half of the property value and more than half of property owners signing. It also clarifies how votes are conducted, especially when funding involves sales taxes, requiring at least a two-thirds majority. The bill explains what information must be included in petitions, like the districtâ€™s purpose, costs, governing structure, and duration. These changes aim to make the process more transparent and ensure proper approval before districts are formed, affecting property owners, local governments, and community planning efforts.
