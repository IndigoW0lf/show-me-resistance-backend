summary_short: "This bill allows certain statements made by minors and vulnerable persons to be used as evidence in court, under specific conditions."

summary: |
  This bill changes the rules for when statements made by children under 18 or vulnerable persons can be accepted as proof in criminal cases. It states that such statements can be used even if they normally wouldn't be allowed, as long as a court finds the statement reliable and the person testifies or is unavailable to testify due to trauma. The bill also clarifies how these statements can serve as proof of a crime without needing additional evidence, and it requires prosecutors to inform the defense about these statements in advance. Overall, it aims to make it easier to use credible statements from vulnerable witnesses in court proceedings, especially in cases involving serious crimes against minors or vulnerable individuals.
