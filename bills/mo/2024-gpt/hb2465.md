summary_short: "This bill prevents candidates from serving as their own treasurer for their campaign committees in Missouri."

summary: |
  The bill changes state rules to ensure that candidates cannot act as their own treasurer for their campaign committees. Instead, candidates must appoint a separate person who lives in the state to handle the committee's finances. This aims to increase transparency and accountability in campaign funding. It affects anyone running for office who previously might have served as their own treasurer, making sure someone else manages the money part of their campaign.
