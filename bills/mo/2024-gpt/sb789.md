summary_short: "This bill requires hospital district boards to get voter approval before partnering with healthcare systems outside Missouri."
summary: |
  The bill changes the rules for hospital district boards by requiring them to ask voters for permission before forming partnerships or collaborating with health care systems operated by institutions outside of Missouri. If a board wants to make such an agreement, they must submit it directly to voters for approval, and at least two-thirds of those voting must say yes. This process involves holding a public vote where residents of the hospital district decide whether to allow the partnership. The goal is to ensure that local residents have a say before their hospital district collaborates with out-of-state healthcare providers.
