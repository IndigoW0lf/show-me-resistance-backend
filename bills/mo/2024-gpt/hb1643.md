  This bill introduces a limited one-year window during which individuals and companies can arrange payment plans for unpaid vehicle sales taxes. It revises existing laws to make it easier for vehicle owners to handle overdue taxes before they can receive their vehicle titles. The law affects anyone purchasing or leasing motor vehicles, trailers, boats, or outboard motors in Missouri, especially those who owe back taxes. It aims to improve tax collection processes and provides options for businesses that rent or lease vehicles to manage their tax obligations more flexibly.
