summary_short: "This bill sets new standards for reinsurance coverage and company examinations for mutual insurance companies in Missouri."

summary: |
  The bill updates rules for how mutual insurance companies in Missouri handle reinsurance, which is insurance companies buy to protect themselves from big losses. It clarifies that companies should only purchase "adequate" reinsurance that is based on reliable models of rare but severe events. The bill also limits the Missouri Department of Insurance's authority, ensuring it cannot require companies to buy more reinsurance than necessary or impose extra oversight through agreements. Additionally, it makes it harder for the department to block mergers unless thereâ€™s clear evidence that the merger would harm policyholders. These changes aim to protect mutual insurance companies and their policyholders while clarifying regulatory authority.
