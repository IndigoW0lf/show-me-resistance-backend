summary: |
  The bill updates Missouri's health program to include coverage for anti-obesity medications for eligible low-income individuals. This means that some people who qualify for MO HealthNet can now get assistance paying for medications that help manage obesity. The change aims to improve access to obesity treatment, especially for those who may benefit from medication as part of their health care. It primarily affects low-income residents enrolled in Medicaid in Missouri and healthcare providers who serve these patients.
