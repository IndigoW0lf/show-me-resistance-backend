  This bill changes existing laws about drug crimes in Missouri, focusing on young people under 22 years old. It makes it a serious crime to sell or distribute controlled substances, like drugs, within certain distances of schools, parks, or public housing. If someone under 22 sells drugs in these protected areas, they can face very strong punishments, including felony charges. The bill also specifies penalties for manufacturing drugs near schools and for trafficking larger amounts of drugs, aiming to improve safety around places where young people gather.
