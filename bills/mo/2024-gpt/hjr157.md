summary_short: "This bill proposes a constitutional amendment in Missouri to strengthen residents' gun rights and allow local governments to regulate firearms through ordinances."
summary: |
  The bill moves to amend Missouriâ€™s constitution to make the right to keep and bear arms unalienable, meaning it cannot be taken away. It states that restrictions on gun rights must be strictly scrutinized and that the state must protect these rights. The amendment also authorizes cities like St. Louis and Kansas City to create local laws about firearm possession, carrying, and transfer, including issuing permits and setting penalties, as long as these laws are consistent with the new constitutional protections. The bill affects gun owners, local governments, and law enforcement by clarifying the scope of gun rights and local regulation.
