summary_short: "This bill proposes amending Missouri's Constitution to explicitly state that it does not protect or guarantee the right to abortion."
summary: |
  The bill, known as SJR62, asks voters to decide in the 2024 election whether the Missouri Constitution should be changed. The proposed change adds a new section that clearly says the stateâ€™s Constitution does not create or protect any right to abortion. If approved, this means the courts and government cannot interpret the Constitution as granting or safeguarding abortion rights. It primarily affects residents of Missouri, especially those interested in reproductive rights and legal protections regarding abortion.
