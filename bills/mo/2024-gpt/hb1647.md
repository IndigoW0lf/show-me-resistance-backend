summary: |
  This bill makes changes to the laws about funding for charter schools in Missouri. It requires that students who attend charter schools are counted as part of their home school district for state aid calculations. The bill also specifies how districts should pay charter schools for student attendance, including the use of state and local funds, and addresses how over- or under-payments should be handled. Additionally, it covers special cases like workplace charter schools and those that declare themselves as local education agencies. These updates aim to clarify funding processes and ensure transparency in how public money supports charter schools and transportation aid.
