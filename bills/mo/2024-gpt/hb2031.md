summary_short: "This bill allows certain health departments to distribute needles for drug programs without being considered illegal and updates related rules and penalties."

summary: |
  This law makes it easier for health organizations registered with the Department of Health and Senior Services to distribute hypodermic needles and syringes as part of programs aimed at reducing health risks from drug use. It creates a registration process for these programs and sets rules to prevent them from operating too close to schools built after the programs started. The bill also updates existing laws to clarify that individuals or groups working with approved needle programs are not committing crimes related to drug paraphernalia, and it establishes penalties for illegal manufacturing and distribution of drug paraphernalia.
