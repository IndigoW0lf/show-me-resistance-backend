summary: |
  This bill establishes the Missouri Covenant Marriage Act, allowing couples to choose a marriage called a covenant marriage. To do so, both partners must declare their intent to enter into a lifelong, faith-based commitment and undergo premarital counseling. The law requires couples to sign a declaration and an affidavit confirming they understand the seriousness of a covenant marriage and agree to work through difficulties, including seeking counseling if needed. This option is available alongside the standard marriage license and affects engaged couples wanting a more committed marriage arrangement. It emphasizes the importance of marriage as a lifelong covenant and aims to promote stronger, more stable marriages.
