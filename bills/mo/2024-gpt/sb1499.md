summary_short: "This bill makes it a capital offense to commit certain serious sexual crimes against children in Missouri."
summary: |
  This legislation establishes the death penalty as a possible punishment for certain severe sexual crimes involving children, such as first and second-degree rape, statutory rape, and sexual trafficking of a child. When these charges are brought, the court will hold a two-stage trial process unless the defendant or the state waives the death penalty. In the second stage, juries or judges will decide whether the offender should receive life imprisonment without the possibility of parole or the death penalty, based on evidence related to the crime and the offenderâ€™s circumstances. The bill impacts individuals accused of these serious crimes, their victims, and the criminal justice system in Missouri.
