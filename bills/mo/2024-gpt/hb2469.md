summary_short: "This bill updates rules about pension benefits and contributions for certain teacher retirement systems in Missouri."
summary: |
  The bill makes changes to how retirement benefits for some teachers are managed in Missouri. It restricts new benefit increases or adjustments unless the pension plan's funding level is at least 75%, or 80% in some cases. It also sets limits on how quickly pension liabilities can be paid off if the plan is underfunded. Additionally, the bill authorizes a one-time extra payment to retired teachers, funded by state money, which can be paid out by September 2025. These rules mainly affect teachersâ€™ retirement plans and the state and school districts responsible for funding them.
