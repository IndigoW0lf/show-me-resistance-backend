summary: |
  The bill removes current sections of the Missouri Constitution and replaces them with new rules about the stateâ€™s House of Representatives. It increases the number of House members from 163 to 202 and sets new standards for how districts are created. The bill requires a bipartisan commission to draw districts that are fair, equal in population, compliant with federal voting laws, connected, and respectful of communities. These changes could affect how representatives are elected and how districts are formed, impacting voters and political representation across Missouri.
