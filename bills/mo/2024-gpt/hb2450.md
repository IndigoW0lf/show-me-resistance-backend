summary: |
  The bill establishes new rules to prevent the mistreatment of dogs through tethering or chaining. It makes it illegal to leave a dog tethered unsupervised, without shelter, food, or water, or in unsafe or unsanitary areas. Dogs cannot be tethered for more than three hours in a day or for extended periods, and the tether or chain used must be appropriate for the dog's size and comfort. Violators can be charged with a class B misdemeanor, and law enforcement or animal control officers have the authority to arrest or seize dogs if necessary to protect their health and safety. The law aims to protect dogs from dangerous or abusive tethering practices and affects dog owners, animal control agencies, and law enforcement.
