summary_short: "Missouri says that bioengineered food labels can't be stricter than federal rules."
summary: |
  This bill prevents Missouri from having more strict labeling rules for bioengineered foods than the federal government. If a food product meets federal requirements, it automatically meets state requirements as well. This means that states cannot require additional or more detailed labels for bioengineered foods beyond what is already mandated by federal law. The goal is to keep labeling consistent across the country and avoid confusing or conflicting rules for food producers and consumers.
