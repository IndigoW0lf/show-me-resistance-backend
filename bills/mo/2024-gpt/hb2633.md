summary: |
  The Missouri Chemical Label Integrity Act mandates that any food product sold or manufactured in Missouri that contains specific dangerous chemicals must have a clear warning label. These labels will list each unsafe chemical present and warn about potential health issues like cancer, birth defects, or reproductive harm. The goal is to give consumers better information about the foods they eat and help them make safer choices. This law affects food manufacturers and sellers, ensuring they provide transparency about chemical contents in their products.
