summary_short: "This bill lets certain cities in Missouri ask voters to approve a tourism tax on hotel stays to boost local tourism efforts."
summary: |
  This bill allows specific cities and counties in Missouri to impose a hotel guest tax of up to 5% on the cost of overnight stays in hotels or motels. The tax can only be added if voters in those areas approve it through an election. The money collected from this tax must be used solely to promote tourism in the area. Not all cities or counties can impose this tax; areas that already have a similar tax or are not within eligible jurisdictions are excluded. This bill aims to give local governments more tools to fund tourism-related activities if their residents support it.
