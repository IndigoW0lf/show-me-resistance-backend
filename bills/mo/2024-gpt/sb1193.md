summary_short: "This law requires employers to provide wage range information to prospective and current employees and imposes penalties for non-compliance."
summary: |
  This new law in Missouri makes it illegal for employers to refuse to tell job applicants or employees the expected salary range for a position. When someone is applying for a job or seeking a promotion, the employer must share the wage range if asked, either at the time of the job offer or after an interview. Employers can ask about a candidate's salary expectations, but they cannot hide or refuse to disclose the wage range. If an employer violates this law, they can be fined between $1,000 and $5,000. The goal is to promote transparency and fairness in wages for workers and job seekers.
