summary: |
  This bill changes the laws about qualified spousal trusts in Missouri. It defines what a qualified spousal trust is and outlines how property held in such a trust is protected from creditors, similar to holding property as tenants by the entirety. The bill clarifies that property in these trusts remains immune from creditors during the lifetime of the surviving spouse, including property appreciation, but this immunity ends if the couple divorces. It also specifies that the trust can have flexible terms and can include other powers for managing property. Overall, the bill provides greater protections and clarity for married couples using these trusts to manage and safeguard their assets.
