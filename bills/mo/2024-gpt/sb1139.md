summary: |
  The bill changes the laws about solid waste disposal areas in Missouri. It requires anyone who wants to build or run a waste processing or disposal site to get permits from the Department of Natural Resources before starting construction or operation. The bill also sets rules for existing facilities, limits the locations of new sanitary landfills, and introduces public involvement steps, such as notifying the community and holding informational sessions, before new disposal areas are approved. These rules aim to make waste management safer and more transparent for communities and facilities.
