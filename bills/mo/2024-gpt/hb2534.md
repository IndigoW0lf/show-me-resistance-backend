summary: |
  This law in Missouri aims to protect the public from misleading advertisements by health care practitioners. It requires all health care providers to use accurate titles that match their licensed profession, such as "doctor," "nurse," or "physician assistant." The bill also mandates that any claims of being "board certified" are only made if the provider is truly certified by a recognized board, including the full name of the certifying organization. These rules help ensure that patients are not misled by false or exaggerated qualifications when choosing health care services.
