summary: |
  This law makes sure that after an election using paper ballots, a special election verification board checks the accuracy of the results. It requires the board to compare their records with official election results and fix any discrepancies. Additionally, the board must perform a random, manual recount of ballots in at least one precinct, including key races and issues, to ensure the accuracy of the vote counts before finalizing the election results. This process is open to the public and aims to increase transparency and trust in election outcomes.
