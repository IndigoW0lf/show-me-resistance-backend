summary_short: "This bill changes how Missouri voters approve constitutional amendments and initiative petitions."
summary: |
  The bill proposes a new rule for approving state constitutional amendments in Missouri. It states that amendments referred to the voters will now need to be approved by a majority of votes statewide and by a majority in more than half of the state's senate districts. It also clarifies that the governor's veto power does not apply to measures sent directly to the voters. These changes aim to modify the process of approving citizen-initiated measures and constitutional amendments, affecting voters, lawmakers, and state election procedures.
