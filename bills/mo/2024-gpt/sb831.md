summary_short: "This bill changes the time limits for filing certain legal cases, including sexual abuse and personal injury claims, in Missouri."
summary: |
  This bill updates Missouri laws on how long people have to bring legal actions in different situations. For example, it extends the time to file lawsuits for sexual abuse from 10 to 15 years after the victim turns 21, and allows certain criminal cases like murder and rape to be prosecuted at any time. It also specifies time limits for other personal injury cases, such as those involving assault or false imprisonment, generally setting a two-year limit. These changes aim to give victims more time to seek justice and clarify how long prosecutors have to bring charges for serious crimes.
