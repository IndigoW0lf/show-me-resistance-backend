summary: |
  This bill, called HB2655, makes it a legal violation for parents or guardians to fail to supervise a child under 15 if the child commits an act that leads to juvenile court involvement, breaks curfew laws, or fails to attend school. The law does not apply to foster parents or child-placing agencies. If someone is found guilty of failing to supervise, they could be ordered to do community service up to 250 hours. The juvenile court will handle first-time offenses, and violations are considered infractions, which are less serious than crimes.
