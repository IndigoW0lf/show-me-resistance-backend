summary: |
  The bill modifies existing regulations to specify who can administer medications in long-term care facilities. It clarifies that trained staff like technicians and nurses' aides can give certain medications, including insulin and some injectable medications prescribed by a doctor. The bill also states that family members and friends can provide nursing care in some cases, and it sets rules for nursing practice by students, recent graduates, military nurses, and nurses from other states or countries. These changes aim to ensure safe medication administration while allowing more flexibility for caregivers and healthcare providers working with residents in long-term care settings.
