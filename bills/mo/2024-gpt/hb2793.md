summary_short: "This bill changes how mining royalties are divided among local communities, giving more weight to mineral extraction contributions."
summary: |
  This bill updates the rules for distributing money received from mining and forest resources in Missouri. It alters the way these funds are shared between public schools and roads in the counties where the resources are found. Specifically, it introduces a new method for allocating proceeds from mining, based on the amount of minerals mined in each county, with a portion also shared equally among counties without mining. These changes aim to more fairly distribute revenue in relation to mineral extraction activity, impacting local governments, schools, and road funding in counties with and near national forests.
