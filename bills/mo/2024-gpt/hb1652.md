  The bill defines a new crime called organized retail theft, which involves stealing merchandise either alone or with others to resell, trade, or return it for money. If the total value of stolen items over 120 days is between $1,500 and $10,000, it is considered a class C felony. If the total theft value exceeds $10,000, it becomes a class B felony. The law also requires courts to order those convicted to pay restitution and clarifies that thefts can be prosecuted in any Missouri jurisdiction where any part of the theft occurred.
