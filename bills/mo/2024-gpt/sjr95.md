summary: |
  This bill, called SJR95, proposes adding a new constitutional right for parents in Missouri. It states that parents have a fundamental right to know what their children are learning in public schools and what materials are available in school libraries. This means parents can access lesson plans, curricula, and a list of books and other resources that their children can access at school. The goal is to promote transparency and allow parents to be informed about their children's education. The change will be voted on by Missouri residents in the next general election or possibly a special election.
