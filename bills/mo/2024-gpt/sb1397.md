summary_short: "This law prohibits government contracts from excluding firearm-related businesses solely because they deal with firearms or related products."

summary: |
  This bill makes it illegal for government agencies to refuse to do business with companies related to firearms, such as manufacturers, sellers, or shooting ranges, just because they are involved in the firearm industry. It applies to contracts between government entities and these companies, as long as the company has at least ten full-time employees. The law aims to prevent discrimination against firearm businesses and ensures they are treated fairly when government contracts are involved. It does not impact companies that refuse products like ammunition or firearms due to policies or laws, or for traditional business reasons not related to firearms.
