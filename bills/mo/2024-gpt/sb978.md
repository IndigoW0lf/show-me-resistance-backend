summary_short: "This bill protects certain healthcare providers and pharmacies from unfair treatment by insurance companies and pharmacy managers regarding 340B drugs."
summary: |
  This bill, known as SB978, makes it illegal for health insurance companies and pharmacy benefits managers to discriminate against federally-qualified health centers and pharmacies that dispense discounted 340B drugs. Specifically, it prevents these companies from paying less, imposing unfair terms, or restricting participation when dealing with these providers. The goal is to ensure that clinics serving underserved populations can access and dispense 340B medications without facing unfair treatment or unnecessary restrictions. This helps support affordable healthcare options for vulnerable communities and ensures fair practices within the healthcare and pharmaceutical systems.
