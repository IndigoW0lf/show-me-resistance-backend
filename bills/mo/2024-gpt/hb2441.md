summary_short: "This bill updates the rules for cities to annex nearby unincorporated areas in Missouri, making the process clearer and more flexible."
summary: |
  This bill changes the laws in Missouri about how cities, towns, or villages can annex, or take over, surrounding unincorporated land. It specifies when and how annexation can happen, especially focusing on areas that are connected or close to the city, even if separated by highways or railroad right-of-ways. The bill allows some cities, especially those near state borders or with certain populations, to annex land up to two miles away for specific purposes like adding correctional centers. These rules aim to make annexation more straightforward while protecting property ownersâ€™ rights and preventing irregular boundaries.
