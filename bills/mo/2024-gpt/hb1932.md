summary: |
  The bill updates the rules about telephone solicitations in Missouri. It creates a system where businesses and residents can choose not to receive telemarketing calls by registering on a no-call list maintained by the Attorney General. This means that businesses and individuals who sign up will be protected from unsolicited sales calls, helping to reduce telemarketing nuisance. The law also clarifies who can make certain kinds of calls and sets regulations for enforcement and registration.
