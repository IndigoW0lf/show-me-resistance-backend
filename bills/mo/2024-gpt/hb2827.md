summary_short: "This bill updates the rules for how utility companies can adjust their rates outside of regular rate cases, allowing for more flexible and transparent rate adjustments related to fuel costs, environmental compliance, and customer usage changes."
summary: |
  This law makes important changes to Missouri's utility rate policies. It allows electric, gas, and water companies to request certain rate adjustments outside of the usual cost review process. These adjustments can account for changes in fuel and power costs, environmental compliance expenses, or variations in customer usage due to weather or conservation efforts. The bill sets limits on how much these rate changes can raise customer bills annually—up to 2.5% of the company's Missouri revenue, with some taxes excluded—and permits utilities to recover those costs over time if they are not fully covered in a single adjustment. These rules aim to give utilities more flexibility while protecting consumers from unpredictable rate spikes.
