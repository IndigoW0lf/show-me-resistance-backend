summary: |
  This bill sets up a special group called the "Task Force on the Marketing of Cannabis and Cannabinoid Products to Children and Pregnant Women." The task force will include representatives from the government, healthcare professionals, and safety experts. Their job is to review current marketing practices for cannabis products and suggest ways to better protect children and pregnant women from targeted advertising. The group will report their findings and recommendations each year to state leaders to help decide if further rules are needed to prevent advertising that may harm these vulnerable groups.
