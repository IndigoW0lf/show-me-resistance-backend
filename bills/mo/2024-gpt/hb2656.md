summary_short: "This bill prevents Missouri state and local agencies from enforcing federal or state red flag laws that allow temporary or permanent gun seizures without a court hearing or probable cause."
summary: |
  This law, called the "Anti-Red Flag Gun Seizure Act," makes it illegal for Missouri state or local government agencies and law enforcement to enforce any federal or state red flag laws. Red flag laws are laws that allow authorities to seize firearms from a person without a court hearing or if there’s no strong evidence that they committed a crime. The bill also states that federal orders related to red flag laws, such as confiscations or gun restrictions, cannot be enforced within Missouri. Additionally, the state will not receive federal funds to enforce such laws. Anyone who attempts to enforce or assist in enforcing a red flag law in Missouri could face legal action and civil penalties. The bill ensures that gun owners’ rights are protected from federal or state measures that bypass traditional legal procedures.
