summary_short: "This bill bans state departments from spending money on diversity, equity, and inclusion initiatives that promote special treatment or divisive ideas."
summary: |
  HB2448 prevents Missouri state government departments from using funds on programs or activities related to diversity, equity, and inclusion that focus on race, gender, or other identities in ways that could promote preferential treatment, divisiveness, or certain ideological viewpoints. It also stops departments from encouraging private companies to adopt these kinds of initiatives as a condition for state contracts. However, it doesnâ€™t prevent departments from following existing employment laws or ensuring accessibility for disabled individuals. This bill aims to restrict the promotion of certain social policies within state government operations.
