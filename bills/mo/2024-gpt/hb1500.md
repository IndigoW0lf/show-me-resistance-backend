summary: |
  This bill makes it mandatory for drivers and passengers in passenger cars (cars designed to carry up to 10 people) to wear seat belts while on public roads. It specifies who must wear seat belts, including certain exceptions for postal workers, people with medical reasons, and agricultural vehicle use. The law also states that if someone isn't wearing a seat belt and gets injured, it can only be used to reduce their compensation if expert proof shows the seat belt failure contributed to the injuries. It does not apply to children under 16 being transported or to motorcycle riders. The rules aim to improve safety and clarify legal consequences related to seat belt use.
