summary_short: "This bill updates the law on when someone can be charged with endangering a child's welfare in Missouri."
summary: |
  The bill changes the rules for when a person can be accused of harming or risking a child's safety. It clarifies situations such as leaving a child under eight unattended in a car or encouraging a child to do dangerous activities. If someone, like a parent or guardian, acts in a way that risks a child's health or safety—even through negligence—they can be charged. The law also specifies penalties, making most offenses a misdemeanor but increasing severity if part of a pattern of harmful behavior.
