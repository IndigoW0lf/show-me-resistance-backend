summary_short: "Allows property owners and contractors to enter up to 10 feet onto a neighboring property to build or repair fences without being liable for trespassing."
summary: |
  This bill lets property owners or their contractors step onto a neighbor’s land, up to 10 feet, when building or fixing a fence—if the neighbor is not sharing in the work. They won’t be considered trespassers or liable for damages, like cutting trees or damaging crops, as long as they stick to that 10-foot limit. The goal is to make fence maintenance easier and clearer, so people can work on fences without worry about legal issues or accidental damage to neighbors' land.
