summary: |
  The bill aims to update Missouri's constitution regarding firearms by repealing the current section on gun rights and replacing it with a new one. It emphasizes that citizens have an unalienable right to keep and bear arms for self-defense, family, property, and law enforcement assistance. The bill also allows local governments like cities and counties to create their own rules for firearm possession and permit issuance, including fees and penalties, as long as those regulations follow certain guidelines. This affects residents, law enforcement, and local authorities by clarifying the scope of gun rights and local regulatory powers.
