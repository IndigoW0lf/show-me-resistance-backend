summary: |
  This bill makes changes to how the Missouri Local Government Employees' Retirement System (LAGERS) board of trustees is selected and managed. It establishes a new process for electing and appointing trustees, including members chosen by system employees, local government employers, and an appointee from the governor. The bill also clarifies the terms of trustees and specifies that, starting in 2025, retireants will elect some of the trustees instead of current employer representatives. These updates will affect the governance of the retirement system and those who work for local governments or are retired under this system.
