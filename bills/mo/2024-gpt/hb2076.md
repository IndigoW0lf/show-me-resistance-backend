summary: |
  This bill changes existing laws related to off-road vehicles, such as all-terrain vehicles (ATVs), in Missouri. It specifies where these vehicles can be legally driven, including on city or county roads with permits, or on private land. The bill also allows authorized government entities to operate ATVs for official use and sets rules for their use within waterways, mainly on land owned by the operators or for traditional crossings. Additionally, it requires operators on roads to have a valid driverâ€™s license and, when on highways, to display a safety flag for visibility. These changes aim to clarify legal operation and improve safety for ATV users and the general public.
