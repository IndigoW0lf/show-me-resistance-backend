summary: |
  This bill is a formal statement from the Missouri House and Senate that supports efforts to stop motorcycle profiling, which is when police target motorcyclists based on their bike or clothing. It highlights concerns that many motorcyclists have experienced unfair treatment by law enforcement and calls for increased awareness, better communication between police and motorcyclists, and policies that condemn profiling. The resolution urges police agencies to include anti-profiling language in their policies and training, and it asks the Chief Clerk to supply copies of the resolution to all law enforcement agencies across the state. It mainly aims to protect motorcyclists from unfair policing practices and promote fair treatment.
