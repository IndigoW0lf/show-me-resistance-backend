summary_short: "This bill limits abortions in Missouri to only in cases of medical emergency, removing other exceptions."
summary: |
  The bill changes Missouri's laws on abortion by making it illegal to perform or induce an abortion unless it's needed to save the pregnant person's life due to a medical emergency. It redefines key terms related to pregnancy, abortion, and fetal development to clarify legal standards. This means that, under this law, abortions will generally not be allowed except when the pregnant person's life is at serious risk, affecting women, healthcare providers, and medical facilities in Missouri.
