summary_short: "This bill adjusts how workers' compensation benefits are calculated for certain first responders in Missouri."

summary: |
  This bill changes the rules for calculating the average weekly pay for workers injured on the job, specifically for first responders like firefighters and police officers. It updates the formula used to determine weekly wages based on different types of pay (like hourly, monthly, or yearly wages), and clarifies how to handle situations when an employee has worked for less than two weeks or earns tips and other benefits. The goal is to make the process fairer and more consistent for first responders who get injured while working. This affects both workers' compensation agencies and first responders who rely on these benefits if they are injured on the job.
