summary: |
  This bill modifies Missouri's rules for income taxes paid by residents. It adjusts how much residents pay based on their income, with gradual changes planned over the next couple of years. Starting in 2023, the top income tax rate will be 4.95%, and from 2025 onward, everyone will pay a flat rate of 4%. It also includes provisions that could reduce the tax rate even further if the state's revenue exceeds certain targets. These changes affect all Missouri residents who file income taxes, impacting how much they owe and how the state's tax system functions in the future.
