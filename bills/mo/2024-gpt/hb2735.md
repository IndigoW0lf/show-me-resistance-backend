summary_short: "This bill repeals laws that prevented local governments from making their own rules about firearms, allowing them to adopt firearm-related regulations unless they follow specific state laws."
summary: |
  This bill removes restrictions that previously stopped cities, towns, and other local governments in Missouri from creating their own rules about firearms. Now, only state laws will govern firearms, but local governments can still pass ordinances that match certain existing state laws or regulate the open carrying of firearms, as long as they follow specific conditions. It also clarifies that the manufacturing and sale of firearms and ammunition are legal activities and prevents local governments from suing firearm manufacturers over how guns are designed, made, or sold. This legislation mainly affects local governments, firearm owners, and businesses involved in firearm sales.
