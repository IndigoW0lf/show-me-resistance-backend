summary: |
  This bill makes it possible for minors or their guardians to take legal action against public libraries, library boards, staff, or agents if they provide or allow access to material that is considered pornographic. It defines what counts as pornographic materials based on community standards and whether the content appeals to minors or lacks educational value. If a library is found to have furnished or let minors access such materials, the law allows for damages of at least $25,000 per incident, with a maximum of $100,000 per single event, plus attorneys' fees and court costs. This law aims to protect minors from exposure to inappropriate content in public libraries and sets specific time limits for filing such lawsuits.
