summary_short: "This bill updates child placement laws and allows parents on medication-assisted treatment to reunite with their children."

summary: |
  This bill changes the rules about placing children in homes or with parents who are involved in legal issues. It states that children cannot be kept apart from parents or placed in homes if the parent has been convicted of certain crimes involving harm to children or other serious offenses. Importantly, the bill also makes it clear that parents being treated with medication-assisted treatment (like medications for opioid dependence) should not be prevented from reunifying or being with their children. Additionally, if a child has been harmed, the court can restrict the child's residence, but the court will no longer block parents from treatment based on their use of medication-assisted treatment. Overall, this bill promotes fair treatment for parents undergoing medication-assisted treatment and emphasizes safety in child placement decisions.
