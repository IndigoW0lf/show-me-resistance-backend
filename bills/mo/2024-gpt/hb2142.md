summary: |
  This legislation modifies Missouri's income tax laws to include a new deduction related to broadband internet expansion grants. It repeals the previous section and enacts a new one that outlines how residents' tax calculations should be adjusted. Specifically, it allows taxpayers to reduce their taxable income by certain amounts related to broadband grant funds, which can make it easier for internet expansion projects to receive financial support. The bill affects individual taxpayers and businesses involved in broadband development, potentially lowering their state taxes if they receive such grants.
