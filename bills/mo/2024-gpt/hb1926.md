summary_short: "Missouri allows plumbers with valid licenses from other areas to work without extra licensing if they pass an approved exam."
summary: |
  This bill makes it easier for licensed plumbers to work in different parts of Missouri. If a plumber has a valid license from one Missouri city or county and has passed an approved exam, other cities and counties must recognize that license. This means they don't need to get a new license from each place they want to work in, as long as they meet the exam requirement. However, plumbers still need to obtain a local business license in each new location where they work. The law applies to licenses issued before August 28, 2024.
