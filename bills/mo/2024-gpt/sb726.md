summary: |
  This bill, SB726, changes existing laws about gender transition treatments in Missouri. It removes the temporary limit that stopped doctors from giving certain treatments—like hormones and surgery—to minors after August 28, 2023. Now, these restrictions will stay in place permanently, meaning doctors cannot provide gender transition surgery or prescribe cross-sex hormones and puberty-blocking drugs to anyone under 18. The goal is to limit access to these treatments for minors in the state, impacting young people seeking gender transition care and the healthcare providers who serve them.
