summary_short: "This bill allows circuit courts in Missouri to issue certificates of good conduct and moral character to certain individuals with criminal convictions, helping them with employment and licensing."
summary: |
  This bill enables Missouri's circuit courts to issue official certificates to individuals who have been convicted of certain offenses, excluding sex offense registrable crimes. These certificates demonstrate that the person has shown good moral character and responsible behavior. The certificates can improve their chances of gaining employment, housing, or occupational licenses by showing their reformed conduct. The bill also specifies that having a certificate doesn't prevent other agencies from reviewing the person's criminal history and that employers won't be held liable for hiring someone with a certificate unless they act negligently or intentionally. Additionally, it provides tools to assist applicants with providing necessary information and requires annual reporting on how many people with felony convictions and certificates are receiving licenses. This affects individuals with prior convictions seeking new opportunities and ensures transparency about certificate issuance.
