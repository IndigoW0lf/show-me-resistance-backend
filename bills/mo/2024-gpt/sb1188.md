summary_short: "This law updates rules about how prescription drugs are shared costs and managed for health plan enrollees in Missouri, including pharmacy operations and medication practices."
summary: |
  This bill makes changes to Missouri laws related to prescription drug cost-sharing and pharmacy practices. It ensures pharmacists can be reimbursed when pharmacies closed or unavailable during emergencies and requires health plans to work only with licensed Missouri pharmacies and distributors. The law also standardizes how health plans apply charges like co-pays and deductibles across their network and limits the amount enrollees pay if the cost sharing exceeds the usual retail price. Additionally, it protects patientsâ€™ access to prescribed maintenance drugs by preventing health plans from forcing changes without provider and patient consent, ensuring fairer drug pricing and access for individuals enrolled in health maintenance organizations.
