summary: |
  The bill reorganizes the Public Service Commission in Missouri by creating new rules for its members and how it handles information. It specifies that the Commission will have five members appointed by the governor, with clear rules about residency, age, and representation from different districts. The bill also tightens restrictions on public access to certain sensitive information the Commission receives, like data from utilities or companies, making sure that confidential details are only shared when necessary and with proper protections. These changes aim to make the Commission's work more transparent while protecting critical infrastructure information, affecting utility companies, government officials, and the public.
