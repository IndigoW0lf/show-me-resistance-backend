summary_short: "This bill updates Missouri's laws on motor vehicle financial responsibility, creating a new enforcement program to improve compliance and streamline violation detection."
summary: |
  This bill creates a new program within the Missouri Department of Revenue to better track and enforce motor vehicle financial responsibility laws. It allows the department to use technology and third-party vendors to compare vehicle registration data with financial responsibility information, helping identify drivers who are not properly insured or do not have the required financial responsibility. The bill also offers offenders a pretrial diversion option instead of fines to encourage compliance. It restricts the use of certain automated enforcement cameras and specifies how data collected can be used to identify violations. This change aims to improve the enforcement process and help ensure all drivers meet their financial responsibility obligations, impacting vehicle owners, law enforcement, and the Department of Revenue.
