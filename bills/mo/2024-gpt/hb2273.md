summary: |
  This bill removes the sales tax on food starting January 1, 2025, with the full exemption taking effect by January 1, 2029. It applies to most basic food items that can be purchased with food stamps and sold through vending machines. However, it does not include food sold for immediate consumption, such as meals from restaurants or cafes that sell mostly prepared foods. The bill aims to make groceries more affordable by reducing and eventually eliminating sales tax on food across the state of Missouri.
