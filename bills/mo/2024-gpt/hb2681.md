summary: |
  The bill allows certain materials and utilities used in building and operating nuclear facilities, particularly defense-related projects, to be exempt from sales and use tax. It also provides tax exemptions for utilities and equipment used in manufacturing, processing, or research activities, as well as for transactions related to defense contracts with the U.S. government. This means businesses involved in these industries can save money on taxes when purchasing necessary materials and equipment. The overall goal is to support nuclear and defense industries by reducing their tax costs, which may lead to increased project efficiency and economic benefits.
