summary_short: "This bill sets new rules for law enforcement accountability, including restrictions on use of force and requirements for officers to intervene if excessive force is used."
summary: |
  HB 1601 makes changes to Missouri law that improve how police officers are held responsible for their actions. It clarifies when and how physical force, including deadly force, can be used during arrests. Officers are not allowed to use certain techniques, like respiratory choke-holds, except in specific circumstances, and using such techniques improperly can lead to dismissal. The bill also requires officers to step in if they see another officer using excessive force and to report such interventions. These rules aim to promote safe and fair policing practices and protect people's rights.
