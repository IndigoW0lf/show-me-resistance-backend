summary: |
  The "Protecting Missouri's Small Businesses Act" is a new law that aims to support small businesses during shutdowns caused by government orders. Starting January 1, 2025, if a business has to close for at least 21 consecutive days or 45 total days due to a government shutdown, certain relief measures will apply. These measures include waiving business license fees for the duration of the shutdown (or at least six months) and lowering property taxes based on the days the business was closed. This law ensures that businesses do not face excessive financial burdens during shutdowns and encourages local governments to consider the economic impact of their shutdown decisions. It affects small business owners, local government agencies, and tax officials across Missouri.
