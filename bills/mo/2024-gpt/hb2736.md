summary: |
  This bill changes previous rules about illegal firearm possession by adding a new rule that makes it a crime for anyone under 18 to possess a firearm while on public property. It also clarifies who can be charged with unlawful possession, including people with prior felony convictions, fugitives, minors, and those who are intoxicated or mentally incompetent. Certain exceptions are allowed, such as carrying a firearm with an adult's help, participating in school or legal hunting activities, or if permitted by law. The penalties vary depending on the personâ€™s criminal history, with more serious crimes resulting in higher-level charges. This law affects minors, law enforcement, and anyone involved in gun-related activities on public property.
