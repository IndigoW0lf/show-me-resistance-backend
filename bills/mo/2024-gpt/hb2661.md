summary_short: "This bill updates the rules for a special fund used to investigate radioactive waste concerns in Missouri."

summary: |
  This bill creates a dedicated fund called the Radioactive Waste Investigation Fund, managed by the state treasurer. The fund is used by the Department of Natural Resources to investigate reports of potential radioactive waste contamination in different areas within the state, especially near federally designated sites. Local governments can ask the department to investigate specific concerns, and investigations are carried out using sound scientific methods by qualified agencies or contractors. The bill sets limits on how much money can be spent from the fund each year and would direct any remaining money at the end of the biennium back to a broader hazardous waste fund. It also emphasizes transparency by requiring results of investigations to be shared publicly and within 45 days of completing testing.
