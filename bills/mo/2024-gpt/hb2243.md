summary_short: "This bill allows eligible Missouri residents to register to vote and cast their ballot on the same day as the election."
summary: |
  The bill updates Missouri's voting laws to make it easier for people to register to vote. It allows voters who are eligible and meet certain requirements to register either before or on the day of the election, rather than only in advance. This change means that eligible residents, including new voters and those who missed the traditional registration deadline, can register and vote on the same day as the election or very close to it. The bill also sets clear rules about who can vote, such as age requirements and restrictions for people with certain legal issues, and outlines acceptable forms of ID for registration.
