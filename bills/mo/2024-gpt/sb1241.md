summary: |
  This bill updates Missouri law to clarify how sales tax is paid when buying new or used motor vehicles, boats, or trailers. It requires owners to show proof of the purchase price when applying for a vehicle title and registration, and it specifies that sales tax must be paid before the vehicle can be registered unless the vehicle is exempt. The bill also introduces a new option for rental and leasing companies to pay an annual fee instead of sales tax on each vehicle they lease out, making it easier for those businesses to operate. These changes aim to improve transparency and streamline the process for vehicle sales and leasing in the state.
