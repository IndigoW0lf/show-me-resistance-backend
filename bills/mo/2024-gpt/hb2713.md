summary_short: "Missouri requires all ammunition sellers to obtain a license starting after December 31, 2024, with certain exceptions for specific clubs and limited sales."
summary: |
  This bill changes Missouri law to require anyone selling firearm ammunition to be officially licensed by the state starting after December 31, 2024. Sellers will need to apply for this license through the secretary of state, who will set eligibility rules and charge a fee. Certain groups, like hunting clubs, shooting clubs, and those making small sales, are exempt from licensing. The goal is to better regulate who is selling ammunition, improve oversight, and enhance public safety.
