summary: |
  This bill makes it illegal for the state librarian to send money to libraries that offer obscene or inappropriate materials to children. It also updates rules about withholding taxes from nonresident entertainers and sports team members, requiring organizations to deduct 2% of payments over $300. The law targets organizations, venues, or persons who pay entertainers or sports professionals outside the state, ensuring proper tax collection and accountability. The main focus is on protecting children from exposure to harmful content in libraries and managing tax obligations for certain entertainers and athletes.
