summary: |
  This bill, SB1446, mandates Missouriâ€™s Department of Elementary and Secondary Education to form a work group that will develop a curriculum for middle and high school students about the dehumanization of marginalized groups. The program aims to teach students about negative practices such as discrimination, slavery, and violence, and how to recognize and stop these issues. The curriculum will include lessons on the history of groups like African Americans, immigrants, Native Americans, and victims of abuse, and will emphasize the importance of standing against dehumanization. The pilot program will be tested in up to 25 schools during the 2025-2027 school years.
