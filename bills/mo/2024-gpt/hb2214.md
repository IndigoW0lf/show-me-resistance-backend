summary: |
  The bill modifies existing laws about towing vehicles in Missouri. It allows law enforcement officers and government agencies to authorize the towing of abandoned or illegally parked vehicles from highways and bridges, especially if they pose a hazard or block traffic. Specific timeframes are established for when vehicles can be towed: 10 hours on urban interstate highways, 24 hours on rural interstates, and similar limits on other roads. It also clarifies that commercial vehicles not carrying hazardous materials can only be removed to a safe location until the owner can be contacted. The bill aims to improve public safety, reduce traffic obstructions, and provide clear procedures for towing various types of vehicles, including those abandoned on water or in violation of laws.
