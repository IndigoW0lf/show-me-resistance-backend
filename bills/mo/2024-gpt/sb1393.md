summary_short: "This bill changes the deadline for school districts to submit proposals to operate recovery high schools in Missouri."

summary: |
  The bill updates the deadline for school districts or groups of districts to submit proposals for starting recovery high schools. Instead of submitting by December, districts now have until July 1st of the previous school year to apply. Recovery high schools are specialized public schools that support students with substance use issues while providing a full high school education. The changes give districts more time to prepare and submit their plans, which are reviewed and approved by the state education commissioner and the State Board of Education. This impacts districts interested in opening or running recovery high schools, the students they serve, and the organizations involved in operating these schools.
