summary: |
  This bill, called the Protecting Missouri's Small Businesses Act, prevents local governments from unfairly taxing or charging fees to businesses that are forced to close due to shutdown orders. Starting from January 1, 2025, if a business closes because of a shutdown order, any business license fees will be waived for that period. Additionally, local governments will reduce the property taxes owed by the business based on the number of days it was shut down. This law aims to help small businesses survive economic hardships caused by government shutdowns and ensures they are not unfairly penalized financially during such times. It mainly affects businesses that have been ordered to close due to government actions and the local governments that impose taxes and fees on these businesses.
