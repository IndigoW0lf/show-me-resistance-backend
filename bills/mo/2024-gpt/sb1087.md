summary: |
  This bill, SB1087, repeals the existing laws known as the certificate of need laws in Missouri. These laws previously required hospitals and healthcare facilities to get approval before expanding or making certain changes. By removing these rules, the bill aims to make it easier for healthcare providers to grow and modify their services. It also includes new rules requiring healthcare staff to wear ID badges and clarifies how managed care organizations can pay facilities when residents receive care in their long-term homes. This impacts hospitals, healthcare facilities, staff, and residents in long-term care settings across the state.
