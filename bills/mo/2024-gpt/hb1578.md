summary_short: "Missouri public colleges must give college credit to students who score 4 or higher on International Baccalaureate exams."
summary: |
  This bill requires in-state public colleges and universities in Missouri to give college course credit to students who take International Baccalaureate (IB) exams and score at least 4 out of 7. It also covers students who take Advanced Placement (AP) exams and score 3 or higher. When students apply for college, the schools must tell them how much credit they could earn based on their exam scores. This helps students save time and money by getting college credit for exams they have already taken.
