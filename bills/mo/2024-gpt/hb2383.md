summary_short: "This bill limits retail businesses from charging extra fees when you pay with credit, debit, or digital cards and requires clear disclosure of any convenience fees."
summary: |
  This bill makes it illegal for retail businesses to add a surcharge that exceeds the actual processing cost when customers pay with credit, debit, or digital card payments. Businesses can still charge a convenience fee if they also offer a no-fee payment option like cash or check, but they must clearly tell customers about any fees beforehand. The bill aims to prevent unfair or hidden extra charges on card payments and protect consumers from excessive surcharges. It affects retail stores and other businesses that accept electronic payments.
