summary_short: "This bill changes the rules for how a public water supply district can be dissolved, including who can file a petition and how notices are published."

summary: |
  The bill updates the procedures for dissolving a public water supply district in Missouri. It requires a petition signed by at least one-fifth of the registered voters from each part of the district or at least fifty registered voters from each part. The petition must describe the district boundaries, explain why dissolving the district is in the publicâ€™s best interest, and include a plan for paying off any district debts. Once the petition is filed, the court will set a date for a hearing and publish notices in newspapers, informing residents of the upcoming hearing. This process makes it clearer and more structured for communities seeking to dissolve their water districts, affecting district residents, local governments, and water management authorities.
