summary_short: "Missouri is creating special tax zones in distressed communities where certain earnings taxes on residents and businesses will be temporarily reduced starting in 2024."

summary: |
  This bill establishes new "earnings tax opportunity zones" in distressed communities within Missouri. In these zones, from January 1, 2024, residents and businesses that earn income, wages, or profits in these areas will be partially exempt from the state's earnings tax. This includes wages for residents working in the zone, wages for workers in the zone, and the profits of businesses and corporations operating there. The goal is to encourage investment, job creation, and economic growth in these struggling communities. Local governments in these distressed areas will need to update and share maps of these zones so everyone knows where the benefits apply.
