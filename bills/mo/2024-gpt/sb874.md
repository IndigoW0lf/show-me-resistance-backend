summary_short: "This bill removes laws related to using hemp extract to treat intractable epilepsy in Missouri."

summary: |
  This bill repeals the existing laws that allowed certain people to use hemp extract for treating severe epilepsy. It specifies that individuals with valid registration cards, including minors under a caregiver's care, can possess and use hemp extract only for this medical purpose. The law also sets rules about how hemp extract must be obtained, labeled, and documented, including limits on the amount (up to 20 ounces, with possible exceptions). Overall, it changes the way hemp extract for epilepsy treatment is regulated and who can legally access it in Missouri.
