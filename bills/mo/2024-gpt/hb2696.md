summary: |
  This bill changes how schools in Missouri provide special education services to children with disabilities starting at age three. It requires school districts to develop plans for delivering these services, involving public and private agencies. Schools must also gather current diagnostic reports for children before placing them in special programs. Additionally, it clarifies how private school students suspected of disabilities are evaluated and how children in special districts are educated. The goal is to ensure children with disabilities receive appropriate support in the least restrictive environment.
