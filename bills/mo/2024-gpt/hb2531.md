summary_short: "This bill sets rules for how utility submeters must work and how customers are billed for their energy use."

summary: |
  The bill requires the Missouri Public Service Commission to create rules for submetering of utilities like electricity. It makes sure that customers who have their own submeters only pay for the energy they use, and that their costs are fair. The bill also sets safety standards for installing submeters, ensures customers get the proper services, and protects them from being cut off from service unfairly. These rules will help make utility billing clearer and safer for people who share buildings or use submeters.
