summary_short: "This bill sets rules about voting on new taxes or tax increases for local governments in Missouri, including when they can be resubmitted after rejection."

summary: |
  Starting August 28, 2024, if residents vote against a new tax or a tax increase proposed by their local government, that proposal cannot be put back to a vote for the next four years. However, the local government can resubmit the proposal sooner if they make a significant change, such as lowering the tax rate by at least 25% or changing how the tax revenue is allocated to a different dedicated fund. This law affects local governments and residents by controlling how frequently tax proposals can be reconsidered after voter rejection, aiming to provide stability and prevent repeated submission of the same or similar proposals within a short time frame.
