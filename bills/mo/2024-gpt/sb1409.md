summary: |
  This bill changes the rules for who can run for Congress in Missouri. It states that anyone running for the U.S. House of Representatives must be a resident of the specific district they want to represent. The bill defines how long a person must live in the district before runningâ€”either 12 months for established districts or 3 months for new districts. Candidates must certify their residency status when they run and again if they win, ensuring only local residents can seek and hold these seats. These changes aim to make sure representatives truly live in the districts they serve.
