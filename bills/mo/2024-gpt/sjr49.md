summary_short: "This bill changes the rules for how voters can propose and approve amendments and laws through ballot measures in Missouri."
summary: |
  The bill updates the process for adding new laws or constitutional amendments via voter-driven initiatives. It requires initiatives proposing constitutional amendments to be signed by at least 8% of voters in two-thirds of the congressional districts, and laws by at least 5%. It sets specific deadlines for submitting petitions and introduces a public review period where citizens can comment on proposed measures. The bill also narrows the types of initiatives that can be used, restricting things like tax increases, certain budget reductions, and gifts from lobbyists, ensuring greater oversight and transparency in the ballot measure process.
