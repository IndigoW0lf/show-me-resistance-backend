summary: |
  This bill changes the rules for professional licensing boards in Missouri. It makes clear that if a licensed professional, such as a doctor, teacher, or contractor, exercises their rights to free speech or religious practice covered by the U.S. and Missouri constitutions, their licensing board cannot penalize or investigate them for doing so. The bill also states that acting in accordance with these rights is not unprofessional conduct, and it prohibits discipline for any adverse action taken because of protected speech or religious exercise. Overall, the law aims to ensure that professionals can speak and practice their religion without fear of discipline or punishment from their licensing authorities.
