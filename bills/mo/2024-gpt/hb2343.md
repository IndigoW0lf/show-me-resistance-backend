summary: |
  This bill updates the rules for school attendance in Missouri. It allows students to be absent from school if they have mental or behavioral health issues, with a written note from a qualified health professional. Schools will need to create a written policy about these types of absences, and the Department of Education will work with the Department of Mental Health to develop a model policy for districts to follow starting in the 2024-25 school year. The law helps support students' mental health needs while clarifying when and how absences are excused, affecting students, parents, guardians, and school districts.
