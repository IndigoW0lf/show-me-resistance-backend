summary_short: "This bill changes how tuition is calculated for schools that do not offer education through 12th grade, especially affecting students attending high schools in other districts."
summary: |
  This bill updates the rules for how school districts in Missouri pay for students who live in one district but attend high school in another district, especially if the district where they live doesn’t have a high school. It sets a clear method for calculating the tuition cost based on the local district’s expenses for that grade level group. The bill also ensures that transportation for these students is provided and allows districts to agree on tuition costs if there’s a disagreement. Overall, it helps ensure fair payment for students attending high schools outside their home district while giving families free choice of school.
