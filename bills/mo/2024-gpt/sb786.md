summary: |
  This bill changes the rules about who can own farmland in Missouri. Beginning August 28, 2024, no foreign individuals or businesses will be allowed to buy or hold ownership of agricultural land in the state. Existing owners who acquired land before that date cannot transfer it to someone else who is foreign or an foreign business. For future land transfers, all proposed sales or transfers involving foreign owners will need to be reviewed and approved by the Missouri Department of Agriculture to ensure they follow this new rule. The goal is to limit the amount of land owned by foreigners to protect local agriculture and land use.
