summary_short: "This bill clarifies what is considered reproductive health care, excluding gender transition procedures for minors and adults."

summary: |
  The bill adds a new legal definition to Missouri law, specifying that reproductive health care does not include gender transition surgeries or the use of cross-sex hormones or puberty-blocking drugs for either minors or adults. This means that these gender transition treatments are not classified as reproductive health care under state laws. It primarily affects healthcare providers, patients seeking gender transition procedures, and policymakers by clarifying what services are included or excluded from reproductive health care regulations.
