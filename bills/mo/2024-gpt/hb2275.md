summary_short: "This bill updates Missouri laws on earnings taxes, allowing tax rates to be gradually reduced if certain revenue conditions are met starting in 2025."
summary: |
  This bill changes how earnings taxes are managed in Missouri cities that are not within counties. Starting in 2025, these cities can lower their tax rates by small steps—specifically, by one-tenth of a percent—if their recent revenue growth exceeds 3% compared to the previous year. The law also requires the city to set aside half of the revenue growth in a special reserve fund, which can be used to offset future revenue losses caused by tax reductions. Overall, the bill aims to make earning taxes more flexible and transparent, encouraging responsible tax management when city revenues grow.
