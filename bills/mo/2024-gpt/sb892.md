summary: |
  This law changes how solar farms are approved and built in Missouri. It requires those planning to build solar farms to submit applications to county authorities before getting state approval. The bill sets limits on how close solar farms can be to churches, schools, towns, or private homes unless specific conditions are met. It also mandates public meetings for transparency, requires permits that specify the projectâ€™s boundaries, and calls for liability insurance to cover potential damages. These rules aim to ensure solar farm development is safe, well-managed, and transparent for communities and developers.
