summary_short: "This bill allows counties and local governments to give property tax credits to certain eligible homeowners of homesteads."
summary: |
  This legislation enables counties and other local government areas in Missouri to offer property tax credits to eligible residents who own a primary home (homestead) and qualify for Social Security retirement benefits. If a county chooses to do so, it can reduce a homeownerâ€™s real estate tax bill based on the amount they paid in previous years, helping to lower their housing costs. Only current year taxes on the homestead are eligible for the credit, and the program requires local governments to adopt specific rules to implement it. This will benefit seniors or other qualifying residents by potentially reducing their property tax burden.
