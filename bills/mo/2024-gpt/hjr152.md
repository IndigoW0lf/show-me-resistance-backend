summary_short: "This bill proposes a constitutional amendment to strengthen gun rights in Missouri, allowing residents to keep and carry firearms with few restrictions while giving cities authority to regulate possession through permits."
summary: |
  This bill seeks to amend Missouriâ€™s Constitution to clarify that citizens have the right to keep and carry firearms for self-defense, property protection, and in support of law enforcement. It explicitly states that these rights are unalienable and can only be limited under strict scrutiny. The proposed change also allows cities like St. Louis and Kansas City to create their own rules for firearm permits, including fees, valid periods, and background checks, while providing exceptions for certain groups such as law enforcement officers, judges, and military personnel. The amendment aims to protect gun rights at the state level but still permits local governments to enact some firearm regulations within legal limits.
