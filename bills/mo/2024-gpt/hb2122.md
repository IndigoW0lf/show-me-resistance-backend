  This bill establishes the "Uniform Collaborative Law Act" in Missouri, which provides a legal framework for resolving disputes without going to court. It defines key terms like "collaborative law process," "collaborative lawyer," and "parties," and explains how the process works, including communication and agreements among participants.
