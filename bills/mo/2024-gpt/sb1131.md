summary_short: "This bill changes how taxes are applied to pass-through business entities like partnerships and S corporations in Missouri."

summary: |
  This bill updates Missouri’s tax laws to ensure that partnerships and S corporations—referred to as "pass-through entities"—pay state taxes based on their income earned within Missouri. Previously, these entities might not have been taxed similarly to other business types, especially after recent federal tax changes. The bill introduces a new tax on affected business entities, which includes partnerships and S corporations, and requires them to pay a tax based on their income from sources within the state. It also provides rules for calculating this tax, including how to handle losses that can be carried forward to future years. The goal is to make the tax treatment of these businesses more equal and transparent, aligning state taxes more closely with federal rules.
