summary_short: "Missouri seeks to join other states in requesting a national convention to amend the Constitution and eliminate income tax."
summary: |
  This bill, called HCR61, is an official request from Missouri's government for Congress to hold a special convention of states. The purpose of this convention would be to propose an amendment to the U.S. Constitution that repeals the Sixteenth Amendment, which allows the federal government to collect income taxes. If enough states join in, this could lead to removing the federal income tax from the nation's constitution, impacting how the federal government funds itself. It specifically affects federal tax laws, the power of Congress to tax incomes, and the relationship between state and federal authority.
