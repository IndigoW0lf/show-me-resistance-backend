summary: |
  This bill updates the rules for distributing money that Missouri receives from the federal government from mineral mining on national forests. It specifies how the funds should be split between public schools and road repairs in the counties where the forests are located. The bill also defines how the money from mineral extraction is divided among those counties, giving more weight to the amount of minerals mined. These changes aim to ensure that local communities benefit more fairly from mineral-related revenue and improve public services like schools and roads.
