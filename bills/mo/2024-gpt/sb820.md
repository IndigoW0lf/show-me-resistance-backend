summary_short: "Creates new laws in Missouri that make it a serious crime to flee from law enforcement during a vehicle stop, especially if it causes injury or death."

summary: |
  This bill, called "Valentine's Law," establishes that it is a serious crime for a person to run away from a police stop or detention in a vehicle if they know or should know law enforcement is trying to stop them. The law states that fleeing in a way that speeds or endangers others, and results in injury or death, is a significant offense. It also presumes a person is fleeing if they continue driving after seeing emergency lights or hearing sirens from police. The bill sets different levels of criminal charges (felonies) based on whether the flight causes injury or death, making the consequences more severe if harm occurs. This law aims to improve safety during police stops and holds offenders more accountable for dangerous fleeing behaviors.
