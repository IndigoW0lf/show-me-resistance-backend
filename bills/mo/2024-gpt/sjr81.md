summary_short: "This bill changes the rules for citizen-initiated laws in Missouri, including restrictions on foreign involvement and taxes, and how constitutional amendments are approved."
summary: |
  This bill proposes amendments to Missouri's Constitution to make it harder for foreign countries or foreign political parties to influence initiative petitions. It bans foreign sponsorship, funding, or donations related to ballot initiatives. The bill also stops initiatives from creating or increasing taxes on food and property. Additionally, it sets new rules for approving constitutional amendments, requiring a majority vote both statewide and within most House districts. These changes aim to increase transparency and limit foreign influence in the state's direct democracy processes.
