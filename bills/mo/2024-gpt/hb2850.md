summary: |
  The bill makes changes to existing laws regarding financial transactions in Missouri. It allows parties to agree in writing to a fixed $10 fee for certain loans and restricts multiple contracts that could result in higher fees. The bill also prohibits charging fees for small personal loans ($1,000 or less) unless specifically allowed, and it clarifies rules for late payment charges and interest fees. These updates aim to protect consumers from excessive or unfair fees when borrowing money. The legislation affects lenders, borrowers, and businesses involved in providing personal loans and credit services.
