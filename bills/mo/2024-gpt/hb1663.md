summary: |
  This bill makes it mandatory for local educational agencies in Missouri to get parents' written permission before making many changes to their child's individualized education program (IEP). This includes initial school placements, changes in location, and adjustments to the amount or type of services provided. Parents have the right to review any proposed changes and visit classrooms before giving consent. The law also requires the education department to provide a standardized consent form in the parent's native language. Overall, the bill aims to give parents more control and transparency when making decisions about their child's special education services.
