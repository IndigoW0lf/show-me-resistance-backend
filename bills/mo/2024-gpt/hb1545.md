summary: |
  This bill updates the laws in Missouri regarding minimum prison time for people convicted of specific serious crimes. It sets new rules that determine how long a person must serve in prison, depending on the number of previous prison commitments for serious felonies. For example, if someone has one prior prison sentence for a felony, they must serve at least 40% of their current sentence or until they turn 60, whichever happens first. If they have two or more previous felony sentences, they must serve at least 50% or more of their sentence. This law mainly affects serious felony offenders and aims to establish clearer minimum time requirements based on their criminal history.
