summary_short: "This bill changes who can vote and run for public office in Missouri, including rules about voting age, felony restrictions, and tax delinquency."
summary: |
  This bill updates Missouriâ€™s laws regarding voting and running for public office. It sets the minimum voting age at 17 years and six months, with eligibility starting at 18. The bill also restricts voting for people who have been convicted of certain felonies or misdemeanors connected to voting rights, especially if many years have passed since their sentence. For candidates, it prohibits individuals convicted of a felony from running for office until they have served their sentence and been discharged, with a 30-year waiting period if the crime affected voting rights. Additionally, candidates must disclose if they have been convicted of a felony, and candidates who owe certain taxes are disqualified from running. These changes aim to clarify eligibility rules for voters and candidates, making transparency in elections clearer.
