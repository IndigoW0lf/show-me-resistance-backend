summary_short: "This bill changes the rules for a tax credit program that encourages businesses to support neighborhood assistance efforts in Missouri."

summary: |
  The bill updates how Missouri's tax credit program works for companies that contribute to neighborhood assistance programs. It specifies the order in which the tax credits are applied and changes the percentage of credit available based on the type of contribution and community. The program aims to incentivize businesses to donate to local community projects, especially in smaller or rural areas, by offering them a significant tax break. These changes affect businesses like insurance companies, banks, and other financial institutions that make qualifying donations, encouraging more investment in community support programs across the state.
