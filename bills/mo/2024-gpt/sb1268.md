summary: |
  This law sets clear rules about the employer-employee relationship between franchisors and franchisees in Missouri. It states that, regardless of any federal agreements, a franchisor is only considered an employer of a franchiseeâ€™s workers if they directly control hiring, firing, discipline, or work instructions. If the franchisor does not have this level of control, they are not responsible for the franchisee's employees. This affects how legal responsibility and employment rights apply to franchisors and franchisees in the state.
