summary_short: "This bill creates the Missouri Uniform Homeowners' Association Act to govern planned communities and their rules starting January 1, 2025."
summary: |
  This bill establishes new laws for homeowners' associations within planned communities in Missouri, effective from January 1, 2025. It defines key terms like lots, common ground, assessments, and the roles of the association and its board of directors. The law clarifies how agreements and rules run with the land, meaning they stay attached to the property even if it is sold. It also ensures that existing community rules stay in place and do not interfere with how developers (called declarants) manage or develop the land. Overall, it aims to make rules clearer for homeowners, associations, and developers involved in planned communities.
