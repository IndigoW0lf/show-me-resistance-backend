summary: |
  This bill updates Missouri's rules for approving changes to its constitution. It requires proposed amendments to be submitted to voters on a separate ballot, with each amendment containing only one main change. To be approved, an amendment must get majority support both statewide and in more than half of the congressional districts. It also clarifies who is eligible to vote on constitutional amendments and sets specific steps for how constitutional proposals are brought to a vote. Overall, these changes aim to make the process of amending the Missouri Constitution more transparent and easier for voters to understand and participate in.
