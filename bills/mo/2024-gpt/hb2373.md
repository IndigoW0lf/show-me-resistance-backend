summary_short: "The bill bans government contracts for electric vehicles unless manufacturers certify they were made without forced or child labor."

summary: |
  This bill prohibits state and local government agencies from entering into contracts to buy electric vehicles or their parts unless the manufacturer provides a sworn certification. This certification must confirm that no forced labor or oppressive child labor was used at any stage of production, including sourcing materials. If a manufacturer falsely claims this, they can face hefty fines, and government entities or their employees who knowingly violate the law can also be fined. The goal is to ensure that the electric vehicles purchased by the government are ethically produced and free from labor abuses, affecting manufacturers, government agencies, and employees involved in procurement.
