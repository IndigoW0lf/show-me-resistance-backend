summary_short: "This bill reorganizes how fire protection districts are represented and elected in certain Missouri counties, creating ward-based elections and requiring wards to be drawn based on population."  
summary: |
  This bill changes the way some fire protection districts in Missouri select their board members. It requires districts within specific counties to be divided into separate wards, each representing roughly the same number of residents. These wards will help ensure that residents in different parts of the district have a fair say in electing their fire district directors. The bill also sets rules for drawing these wards and specifies how current and future board members will be elected or appointed based on their ward. These changes mainly affect districts located within larger counties that have a special kind of government called a charter county and that are within or near certain street light districts with a specific number of voters.
