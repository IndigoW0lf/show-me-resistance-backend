summary_short: "This law requires online businesses to verify that minors cannot access harmful material harmful to minors on their websites and holds them liable if they fail to do so."
summary: |
  This bill creates rules for online companies that publish or distribute material harmful to minors. It defines what content is considered harmful, such as sexually explicit material that appeals to minors or is offensive to adults. Businesses must verify that anyone trying to access such material is at least 18 years old, using reliable age verification methods. If a company doesn't follow these rules and minors gain access to harmful content, they can be held financially responsible for any damages. The law aims to protect minors from harmful online content without imposing liability on internet service providers or users.
