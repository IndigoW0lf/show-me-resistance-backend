summary: |
  This bill updates the rules about when Missouri schools can start their year. It makes special exceptions for districts that have charter schools or operate all year long. Schools that are not affected can set their opening date no earlier than 14 days before September, but they need to follow specific procedures if they want to start earlier. The bill also includes penalties if districts start too early without following the rules. Overall, it aims to give districts more flexibility while maintaining some guidelines for when schools can begin each year.
