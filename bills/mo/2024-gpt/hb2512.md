summary: |
  This bill requires all public high schools in Missouri to display posters that provide information about driver education courses. The posters must be placed in visible areas where students can easily see them, and they will include details about the availability, locations, and meeting times of the courses. The Department of Elementary and Secondary Education will create rules to make sure schools follow this requirement. This change aims to help students find out about driver education opportunities more easily.
