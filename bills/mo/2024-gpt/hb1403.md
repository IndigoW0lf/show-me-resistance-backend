summary: |
  This bill rewrites the current law about delivering controlled substances in Missouri. It clarifies what actions count as illegal, such as distributing, trying to distribute, or letting minors buy or transport controlled substances. The bill increases penalties for certain offenses, making them more serious depending on the amount of drugs and whether minors are involved. It also sets harsher punishments if the drugs are marketed to minors through products that look or taste like candy or drinks. These changes affect anyone involved in drug distribution, especially those repeatedly or with minors in mind.
