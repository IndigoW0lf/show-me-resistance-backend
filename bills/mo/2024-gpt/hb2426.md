summary_short: "Requires two-thirds approval in each chamber of the legislature before exempting funds from reverting to the state's general revenue at the end of a biennium."

summary: |
  This bill changes the rules about how leftover money from state funds is handled. Normally, most unspent funds must be returned to the state's main budget after each two-year period unless specific legislation says otherwise. To create an exemption, meaning funds that donâ€™t revert to the general revenue, both the House and Senate must approve it by a two-thirds majority. This makes it harder to keep some funds outside of the regular budget rules unless there is broad legislative support.
