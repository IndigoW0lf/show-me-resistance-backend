summary: |
  This bill updates the unemployment security laws in Missouri to specify when a person can qualify for unemployment benefits. It sets a new rule that claimants must earn wages totaling ten times their weekly benefit amount before getting benefits, unless they have good reasons for quitting work. The bill clarifies situations where someone can still receive benefits, such as quitting to accept a better job, returning to a regular employer after temporary work, leaving due to pregnancy, or moving because of a spouse's military transfer. It aims to make the rules clearer and fairer for people facing different life circumstances when applying for unemployment benefits.
