summary: |
  This bill changes the rules for how property in Missouri is valued for tax purposes. It requires county assessors to make a list each year of all taxable real estate and personal property. Personal property will be assessed at one-third of its true value, and real estate will be assessed based on its true value, including new constructions and improvements. The bill introduces specific rules for assessing property near certain commercial airports and details how assessed values are updated every two years. It also directs assessors to create and submit assessment plans to local and state authorities. These changes affect property owners, local governments, and assessors by potentially altering how property values—and thus taxes—are determined.
