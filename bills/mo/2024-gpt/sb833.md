summary_short: "This bill updates the rules for utilities to acquire land needed for projects like power lines, pipelines, and dams through legal condemnation processes."

summary: |
  The bill changes current laws to make it clearer and easier for utility companies such as electric, gas, and pipeline companies to legally obtain land needed for their infrastructure projects. If these companies cannot agree with landowners on fair payment, they can ask a court to help determine compensation. The law also requires that all relevant property owners or their representatives be properly involved in the process. These updates aim to streamline land acquisition for utilities while ensuring owners are fairly compensated and involved when their property is affected.
