  This bill requires vapor product manufacturers selling in Missouri to regularly certify to the state that they are following federal laws and regulations.

The bill also mandates that the Missouri Department of Revenue maintain a publicly accessible list of all certified vapor products and manufacturers. This helps ensure transparency and that vapor products sold in Missouri meet federal health and safety standards.
