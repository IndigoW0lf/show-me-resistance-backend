summary_short: "This bill changes the age at which people can be excused from jury service to 70 years or older."

summary: |
  The bill updates Missouri law to allow individuals aged 70 and above to be excused from serving as jurors without needing to request an exemption. Previously, the exemption age was 75. This change may make it easier for seniors aged 70 to 74 to avoid jury duty if they choose. The bill also maintains other grounds for exemption, such as recent jury service, health issues, or hardships, and clarifies how courts can decide if serving would cause significant difficulty for a person. Overall, it affects people aged 70 and older, making jury exemption more accessible for them.
