summary_short: "This bill changes the rules about employer liability and workers' compensation in Missouri."
summary: |
  The bill updates Missouri laws to clarify when and how employers are responsible for employee injuries or deaths caused by work-related accidents or illnesses. It maintains that employers must provide compensation regardless of negligence, but it introduces new rules on how safety violations or employee misconduct, like drug use, can affect the amount of compensation. For example, if an employee is injured because the employer failed to follow safety standards, the benefits can be increased by 25% to 50%. Conversely, if an employee ignores safety rules or causes an injury through deliberate acts like drug use, their benefits can be reduced by 25% to 50%. The bill also states that employees can't seek additional legal remedies outside of worker's compensation for workplace injuries unless their injury was intentionally self-inflicted. This legislation mainly impacts employers and workers covered by Missouri's workers' compensation laws.
