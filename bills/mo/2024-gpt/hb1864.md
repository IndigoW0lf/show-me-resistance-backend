summary_short: "This bill updates Missouri's rules for net metering, allowing more residents and businesses to generate their own renewable energy and feed excess power back to the grid."

summary: |
  The bill, called the "Net Metering and Easy Connection Act," revises existing laws to make it easier for people and businesses in Missouri to use renewable energy sources like solar and wind. It sets clear definitions for terms such as customer-generators and net metering, and specifies that retail electric suppliers must offer net metering options on a first-come, first-served basis until a certain capacity limit is reached. This enables those who generate their own clean energy to receive credit for the excess power they send back to the grid, potentially lowering their electricity bills. Overall, the bill encourages the use of renewable energy and makes the process of connecting renewable systems simpler and more accessible for Missourians.
