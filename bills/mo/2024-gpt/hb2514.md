summary: |
  The bill provides a new way for some prisoners in Missouri to be moved to less secure, minimum security facilities. It applies to inmates who are 65 or older, have a terminal illness, or qualify for medical parole. To be transferred, these prisoners must have a good conduct record, show they are rehabilitating, and meet specific security and mental health criteria. This aims to make incarceration more appropriate for older or seriously ill inmates while potentially reducing costs and improving their well-being.
