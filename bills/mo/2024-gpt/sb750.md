summary_short: "This bill updates how delinquent property taxes are collected and managed in Missouri."
summary: |
  This bill changes the laws related to collecting unpaid property taxes on real estate. It repeals many old laws and replaces them with new sections that clarify how counties should handle delinquent taxes. The bill allows counties to choose different methods for managing overdue taxes, including a process called "partial opt-in," which lets some counties decide to follow specific procedures after a property has been unpaid for at least two years. These changes aim to improve the enforcement of property tax collection, making it clearer and more organized for counties, property owners, and local governments.
