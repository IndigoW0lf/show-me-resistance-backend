summary: |
  HB2385 is a law that stops cities and counties in Missouri from making rules about how much rent can be charged for rental homes or commercial properties. It also makes it illegal for these local governments to prevent landlords from refusing to rent to someone just because their income comes from federal housing programs. This bill mainly protects private property owners and landlords, giving them more control over rental decisions. However, it still allows local governments to regulate their own property, create deals with private landlords about rent for certain subsidized housing, or set rent rules for properties funded by community development grants.
