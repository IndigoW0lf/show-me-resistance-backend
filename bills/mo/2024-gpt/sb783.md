summary: |
  This bill revises Missouri's rules about when and how a person can legally defend themselves or others using force. It allows people to use physical force if they reasonably believe it's necessary to prevent harm from unlawful actions, with certain exceptionsâ€”such as being the original aggressor or attempting to commit a crime. The bill also specifies when deadly force can be used, like to prevent serious injury or if someone unlawfully enters a home or property. Additionally, it states that people aren't required to retreat in their own homes or lawful places, and it shifts the burden of proof in court to when a person claims they acted in self-defense. These changes aim to clarify self-defense rights and responsibilities for Missourians.
