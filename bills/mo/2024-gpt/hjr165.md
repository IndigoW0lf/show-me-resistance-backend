summary_short: "A proposed change to Missouri's constitution to affirm the right to keep and bear arms, with new regulations for cities and counties."
summary: |
  This bill proposes a constitutional amendment in Missouri to update the state's gun rights laws. It would reaffirm that all citizens have an unalienable right to keep and carry firearms, ammunition, and related accessories for self-defense, protecting their homes, families, and property, as well as when assisting law enforcement. The amendment also sets limits on restrictions, requiring strict scrutiny for any new laws, and clarifies that cities and counties can create their own regulations for firearm possession and carrying, including issuing permits and setting penalties. These regulations can apply to residents and non-residents, with some exemptions for law enforcement, judges, security personnel, and active military members. The change would be voted on by the public in November 2024.
