summary: |
  The bill, known as the Department of Transportation Fiber Network Expansion Act, authorizes the Missouri Department of Transportation to work with private companies through public-private partnerships to build and improve fiber optic internet networks. It focuses on expanding broadband access in areas that currently lack sufficient service. The process will involve competitive bidding, and at least 25% of the workers on these projects must be from racial minority groups. Additionally, private partners may use the fiber capacity to offer internet services that meet state standards. This legislation aims to improve internet connectivity for underserved communities across Missouri.
