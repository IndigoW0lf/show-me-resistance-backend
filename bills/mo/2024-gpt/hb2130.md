summary: |
  The bill updates rules for special license plates in Missouri for members of the General Assembly, U.S. Congress members, and top state officials like the governor and attorney general. It lets these officials apply for personalized plates that display their titles and district or office numbers, instead of the standard "Show-Me State" plates. Each eligible person can have up to two sets of these plates while they are in office. The change aims to give public officials a way to display their roles on their vehicles and make the license plates more personalized.
