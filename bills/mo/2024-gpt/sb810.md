summary: |
  SB810 changes the regulations governing how the Missouri Medicaid program (MO HealthNet) pays for healthcare services for eligible low-income residents. It clarifies payment rules for hospital stays, outpatient services, laboratory tests, X-rays, and nursing home care. The bill also sets specific guidelines for what costs are covered and how payments are calculated, especially for high-volume facilities and those serving vulnerable populations like children or mentally ill individuals. These changes affect healthcare providers, hospitals, nursing homes, and low-income residents relying on Medicaid for their medical needs.
