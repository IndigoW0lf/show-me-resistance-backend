summary_short: "This bill sets residency requirements for Missouri's congressional candidates and clarifies what counts as residency before running for office."
summary: |
  The bill requires candidates for Missouri's U.S. House of Representatives to live in the congressional district they want to represent for a certain period before running for office. For established districts, candidates must have lived there for at least 12 months, while for new districts, the period is at least 3 months. It also states that only residents of the district can run for and be elected to represent it. The bill includes provisions to verify candidatesâ€™ residency before they appear on the ballot and makes false residency statements a serious crime. These rules will start applying to elections in 2026 and later, but not for the 2024 elections.
