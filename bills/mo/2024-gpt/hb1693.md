summary_short: "This bill makes it a crime to use minors to commit or hide crimes, with punishments increasing for repeated offenses."
summary: |
  This bill creates a new law in Missouri that makes it illegal for anyone 18 or older to intentionally use a minor (someone under 18) to commit a crime or help avoid being caught for a crime. If someone does this, they can be charged with a felony, with the severity increasing for each repeat offenseâ€”from a Class E felony the first time, to a Class D felony the second time, and a Class C felony if it happens again. The law aims to prevent adults from involving minors in criminal activities and provides stricter punishments for repeat offenders.
