summary_short: "This bill creates a new advisory committee to develop uniform designs and colors for Missouri's vehicle license plates."

summary: |
  This legislation replaces an existing law to establish a new committee that will design and set standards for Missouri's vehicle license plates. The committee includes members from the Department of Revenue, Highway Patrol, and other state offices, and will work to create consistent and visually appealing license plates across the state. Before finalizing the design, they will hold at least three public meetings to gather input from residents. The goal is to have these new uniform plates issued by January 2027, and the committee will finish its work once its tasks are completed.
