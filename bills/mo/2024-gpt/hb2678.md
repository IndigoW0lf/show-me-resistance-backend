summary: |
  The bill, HB2678, prohibits students from acting in ways that imitate or relate to "furry" culture or behavior while at school. Specifically, if a student claims to be an animal character or acts like one, they cannot take part in school lessons or activities. If a student does this, their parent or guardian must remove them from school for the rest of that day. This law applies starting with the 2024-25 school year and continues in future years.
