summary: |
  The bill, HB2638, makes it clear that colleges and universities cannot deny students access to their transcripts just because they owe money. Schools cannot require payment of debts before giving out transcripts, charge higher fees, or make obtaining transcripts harder because of unpaid bills. This applies to both current students and alumni, ensuring that students' ability to get their academic records is protected regardless of any outstanding payments. The law aims to make the process of getting transcripts fair and straightforward for all students.
