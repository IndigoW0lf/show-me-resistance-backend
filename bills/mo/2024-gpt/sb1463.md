summary_short: "This bill changes how fault is determined in civil lawsuits, including how parties are liable and how damages are shared."
summary: |
  This bill updates Missouri laws to clarify how fault is assigned in personal injury and other civil cases. It requires the judge or jury to determine the percentage of fault each person or entity had, even if they are not part of the lawsuit or have already settled. The bill also specifies how liability is shared based on fault percentages, with particular rules for those found mostly responsible (more than 50%) and for others less responsible. These changes aim to make fault, liability, and contribution clearer and more consistent in civil court cases.
