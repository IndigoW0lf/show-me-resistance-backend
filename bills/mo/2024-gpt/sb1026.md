summary_short: "This bill updates Missouri's child custody laws to clarify and modernize how custody and parenting time are determined in family court cases."

summary: |
  This bill revises Missouri law regarding child custody arrangements. It clearly defines types of custody, such as joint legal custody (shared decision-making) and joint physical custody (shared parenting time). The law also establishes a presumption that itâ€™s best for a child to have significant time with both parents, but this can be challenged if there is evidence of domestic violence or other concerns. The court will consider factors like the child's best interests, parental wishes, the child's relationship with family, and each parent's ability to cooperate, to decide custody arrangements. These changes aim to promote fairer and clearer custody decisions that support the child's well-being.
