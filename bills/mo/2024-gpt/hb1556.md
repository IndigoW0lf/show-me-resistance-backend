summary_short: "This bill updates rules for solid waste incineration and transfer stations to protect public health and safety."
summary: |
  This bill changes the law to set new requirements for facilities that burn solid waste and for waste transfer stations. It requires that incineration facilities be located with a safety buffer zone to keep nearby residents, schools, and businesses safe. Additionally, new rules specify that transfer stations in counties with a city charter must also have buffer zones of at least 1,000 feet from nearby homes or businesses, unless the station transfers waste directly between trucks without storing waste overnight. These rules are designed to reduce health and safety risks for communities where these facilities are located.
