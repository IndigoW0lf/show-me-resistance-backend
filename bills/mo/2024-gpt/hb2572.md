summary: |
  This bill, called the "Child Poverty Reduction Act of 2024," makes it a requirement for individuals to work with child support enforcement programs in order to qualify for SNAP (food assistance) benefits. If a person owes child support and is behind on payments, they can be disqualified from receiving SNAP benefits during that month. The goal is to encourage child support payments and help reduce child poverty while ensuring assistance reaches families who meet the programâ€™s requirements.
