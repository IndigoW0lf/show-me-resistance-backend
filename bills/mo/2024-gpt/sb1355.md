summary: |
  This bill creates a program in Missouri that offers a one-time financial grant to businesses to help pay for cybersecurity upgrades. The stateâ€™s Department of Economic Development will distribute up to $10 million each year, with each company eligible for up to $15,000. Priority is given to small companies with 1 to 50 employees and those working on protecting critical infrastructure for the state. Businesses must apply online and show how they plan to spend the funds on specific cybersecurity improvements. They will also need to provide proof after one year on how they used the money. The goal is to help companies strengthen their cyber defenses, making them safer from cyber threats.
