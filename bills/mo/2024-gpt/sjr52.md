summary: |
  This proposed amendment to Missouriâ€™s Constitution aims to stop people or businesses from outside the United States from buying or owning farmland in Missouri. If approved, it will require any foreign owners of agricultural land to sell their property within one year after January 1, 2025. The state government will conduct an audit to find existing foreign owners, and if they do not sell their land on time, the land can be seized and sold at public auction. The bill also states that only U.S. citizens can buy farmland in the future. This affects foreign individuals and businesses currently owning farmland, as well as the broader agricultural community in Missouri.
