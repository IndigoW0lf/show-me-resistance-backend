summary: |
  This bill clarifies the rules for insurance companies in Missouri when they are in financial difficulty or going out of business. Specifically, it sets procedures for what happens to reinsurance agreements—contracts where insurers share risks with other companies—when an insurer is placed into conservation, rehabilitation, or liquidation. The bill allows guaranty associations to assume rights and obligations under these reinsurance contracts within a certain period, ensuring continued protection for policyholders. It helps ensure that claims are paid and contracts are managed properly even if an insurance company fails.
