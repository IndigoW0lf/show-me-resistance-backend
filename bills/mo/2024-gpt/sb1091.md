summary_short: "This bill updates rules about how counties in Missouri can add extra sales taxes with voter approval."
summary: |
  The bill changes existing laws to make it easier for counties in Missouri to decide for themselves whether to impose additional local sales taxes. Counties can now ask voters in local elections to approve these extra taxes, which can be between one-eighth and one-half of a percent, to fund specific purposes like community projects. The bill clarifies the process for proposing, voting on, and collecting these taxes, and sets some limits on how high the total sales tax can go, especially in cities and certain facilities. It aims to give local governments more flexibility to raise funds with voter approval, while also controlling the total tax rates for taxpayers.
