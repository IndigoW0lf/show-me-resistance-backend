summary: |
  HB1865 modifies the existing laws to expand and clarify what counts as renewable energy. It details various sources of renewable energy, such as wind, solar, crop-based, landfill methane, and certain small hydropower projects, among others. The bill also includes fuel cells that use hydrogen generated from these renewable sources and confirms that energy sources not previously included can become recognized as renewable if certified by the state. These changes will affect electric utilities, renewable energy producers, and regulatory agencies by broadening the types of energy considered renewable and eligible for renewable energy credits.
