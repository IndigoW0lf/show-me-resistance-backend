summary_short: "Public school restrooms, showers, and locker rooms must be designated for and used only by students of the same biological sex, with some accommodations for students whose gender identity differs from their biological sex."

summary: |
  This bill requires all public schools in Missouri to designate restrooms, locker rooms, and shower rooms for students based on their biological sex—meaning male or female as determined at birth. Students will only be allowed to use the facilities matching their biological sex, unless they have parental or guardian written consent to use alternative accommodations. For students whose gender identity doesn’t match their biological sex, schools can provide other options such as single-stall bathrooms or special access to staff facilities, but not shared facilities designated for the opposite biological sex. The goal is to ensure student privacy and safety in school facilities.
