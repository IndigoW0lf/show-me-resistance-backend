summary_short: "This bill creates a new type of health benefits contract for members of certain organizations, clarifying it is not insurance."

summary: |
  The bill allows certain large, member-focused organizations like farm bureaus to offer health benefit contracts to their members. These contracts are not considered insurance under Missouri law and are only available to members of qualified organizations with specific criteria, such as having at least 100,000 dues-paying members and over 500 million dollars in assets. The organizations must use approved administration services to process claims and benefit determinations. This change aims to provide additional health benefit options outside traditional insurance, while clearly stating these contracts are not insurance products and are not protected by the state insurance guarantee fund.
