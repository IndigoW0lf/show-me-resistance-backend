summary_short: "This bill lets eligible Missouri taxpayers deduct the amount they pay in tangible personal property taxes from their income taxes starting in 2025."  
summary: |
  This bill makes it possible for certain Missouri taxpayers to reduce their state income tax by the amount they pay in tangible personal property taxes each year. A "qualified taxpayer" is someone who has an income tax liability and actually pays these taxes on personal property, such as equipment or business assets. Starting in 2025, they can subtract the amount they paid in taxes from their Missouri taxable income, potentially lowering their tax bill. The program will last for up to 12 years if reauthorized and includes rules for how the Department of Revenue will verify payments. It aims to help taxpayers offset the cost of personal property taxes they owe, with some limits on the types of taxes that qualify.
