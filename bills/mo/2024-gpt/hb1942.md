summary: |
  The bill revises Missouri laws on when and how courts can award spousal support after marriage ends. It clarifies that maintenance can be granted to either spouse if they lack sufficient property to meet their needs and cannot support themselves, especially if they are caring for a child or disabled. The law emphasizes that spouses should become self-supporting over time and sets guidelines for how maintenance amounts and duration are determined. It also specifies that support orders can be temporary or ongoing but must state if they can be changed later. Overall, it affects divorced or separated spouses and the courts deciding support cases.
