summary_short: "This bill gives legal protection to people who forcibly enter a vehicle to help animals trapped inside."
summary: |
  The bill states that if someone sees an animal locked inside a vehicle and believes it is in danger, they can enter the vehicle without fear of being sued for damages. They must make sure the vehicle is truly locked or no other way to get the animal out, believe the animal is in immediate danger, contact emergency responders first, stay nearby until help arrives, and only use the necessary force. This law aims to encourage people to act quickly to save animals in hot or dangerous conditions without worrying about legal consequences.
