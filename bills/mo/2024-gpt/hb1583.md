summary_short: "This bill requires people who want to dig at a site to notify the Department of Natural Resources, which will check if the site has hazardous waste contamination before allowing the work."
summary: |
  The bill makes it mandatory for anyone planning to excavate or dig at a site to send a notice of their plans to the Department of Natural Resources. Once the department receives this notice, it will check if the site is involved in ongoing environmental cleanup, has unfinished cleanup, or is listed as a hazardous waste site. If the site is contaminated or involved in cleanup, the department will require testing of the soil to ensure it is safe for excavation and will inform the excavator of the results. This helps protect workers and the environment by ensuring that excavations do not disturb hazardous waste sites without proper safeguards.
