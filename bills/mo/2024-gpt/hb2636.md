summary: |
  This bill updates the laws about stopping at railroad crossings. It requires drivers to stop within 15 to 50 feet of the nearest rail whenever signals warn of approaching trains or equipment, or when gates are lowered. Drivers must also wait until it is safe before crossing and cannot go around barriers or drive if there isnâ€™t enough space or clearance. The law applies to all vehicles, including big commercial trucks, and aims to improve safety around train and on-track equipment crossings. Anyone who breaks these rules can be charged with a misdemeanor. This law affects all drivers, vehicle operators, and rail safety officials.
