summary_short: "This bill changes the rules for when minors can be tried as adults in court, including new provisions for certain serious crimes."
summary: |
  This bill updates Missouri law about how and when a juvenile can be transferred to adult court for criminal cases. It allows courts to hold hearings and decide whether a child aged 14 to 18 should be prosecuted as an adult if they commit serious crimes like murder or drug manufacturing. Certain very serious offenses automatically require a hearing to consider transferring the case. The bill also clarifies procedures for giving notice to the juvenile and their family, and it specifies how evidence and age misrepresentation are handled. These changes impact juveniles accused of serious crimes, their families, juvenile and criminal courts, and law enforcement.
