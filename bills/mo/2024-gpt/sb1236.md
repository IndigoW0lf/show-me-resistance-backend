summary_short: "This bill improves legal support for children involved in court cases related to abuse and neglect."
summary: |
  This bill ensures that children who are part of court cases about abuse or neglect will be appointed a lawyer for as long as the court has jurisdiction. It also allows the court to appoint a guardian ad litem, a person who represents and advocates for the child's best interests, in more cases involving abused or neglected children. The bill sets rules for how guardians ad litem are chosen, what information they receive, and their responsibilities during the case. It also allows guardians ad litem to be paid for their work, with certain protections to ensure children's safety and fair treatment.
