summary: |
  The bill, called "Hannah's Law," updates the rules for young people on water. It states that children under age 12 must wear a life jacket approved by the U.S. Coast Guard whenever they are on a boat or swimming in waters deeper than three feet. The law applies whether they're on a watercraft or wading in public waters, unless they are in a fully enclosed part of the boat or are supervised by a lifeguard. If someone allows a child to be without a life jacket when required, they could face a small fine. The goal is to improve safety for children in and around water.
