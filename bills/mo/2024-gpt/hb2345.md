summary_short: "This bill allows the Office of Administration in Missouri to negotiate final contract terms with vendors after proposals are submitted, especially for large purchases."

summary: |
  This bill updates Missouri law to let the Office of Administration negotiate specific contract terms with vendors after receiving proposals, rather than only choosing the lowest bid. It applies to government purchases over $100,000, requiring the department to advertise the opportunity, collect proposals, and then conduct negotiations to clarify terms and get the best overall deal. The goal is to give the state more flexibility to secure favorable contract conditions while maintaining fair and transparent processes. This change mainly affects state agencies, vendors, and those involved in government procurement to ensure efficient and cost-effective purchasing.
