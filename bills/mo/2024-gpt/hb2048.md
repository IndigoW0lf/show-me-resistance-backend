  The bill makes it a rule that anyone recording a property sale must include the sale price in the official paperwork. If they don't, they can be fined five percent of the property's sale price. This affects sellers, buyers, and real estate agents, ensuring more transparency in property transactions. The goal is to make sure everyone has clear information about how much real estate is selling for in the state of Missouri.
