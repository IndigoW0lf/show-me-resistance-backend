summary: |
  This bill, SB946, eliminates the previous deadline for ending funding for the Basic Civil Legal Services Fund in Missouri. The fund was created to provide legal help to low-income people facing civil issues, such as family, housing, or benefits disputes. By removing the expiration date, the bill guarantees that funding for these legal services will continue indefinitely, helping eligible residents access the legal support they need. The Missouri Supreme Court will oversee the fund, which collects money from court surcharges and other sources, and allocates it to qualified legal service organizations across the state.
