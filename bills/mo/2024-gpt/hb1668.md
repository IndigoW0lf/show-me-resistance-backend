summary: |
  HB 1668 changes the way the maximum allowed increase in property assessment values is calculated for local governments. It sets new limits on how much the assessment growth factor—based on inflation—can be applied each year. This affects how much property owners might pay in taxes by influencing how local governments set their tax rates. The bill aims to provide clearer rules for assessing property value increases and helps ensure tax rates stay within legal limits, benefiting property taxpayers and local budget planning.
