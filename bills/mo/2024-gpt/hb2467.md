summary_short: "This bill updates the rules for the Missouri Ethics Commission, including how members are appointed and their qualifications."
summary: |
  The bill changes the structure and appointment process of the Missouri Ethics Commission, which is responsible for overseeing ethics rules in the state. It creates a six-member, bipartisan commission appointed by the governor with input from the political parties that had the most votes in the last governor's race. The bill also sets specific eligibility requirements for commissioners, such as filing financial disclosures and having a history of political contributions. Additionally, it clarifies that the commission is supervised only for budgeting purposes and not for its regulatory decisions. These changes affect how ethics oversight is managed and who can serve on the commission.
