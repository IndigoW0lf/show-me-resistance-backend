summary_short: "This law allows certain older prisoners with long sentences to request a parole hearing after serving 30 years, if they meet specific conditions."

summary: |
  This bill introduces a new rule for prisoners in Missouri who are serving very long sentences, including life without parole for at least 50 years. If the prisoner is 60 years or older, has no prior serious felony convictions, and is not a sex offender, they become eligible for a parole hearing after completing 30 years of their sentence. The parole board will review their conduct, rehabilitation efforts, community support, and risk factors to decide if they can be released into the community. If granted parole, the offender will be supervised for at least five years after release. This law aims to provide more opportunities for older, rehabilitated prisoners to be considered for parole.
