summary_short: "This bill changes how Missouri voters approve constitutional amendments and bans foreign influence on these proposals."

summary: |
  This bill modifies the rules for passing constitutional amendments in Missouri. It requires proposed amendments to be submitted to voters on a separate ballot without party labels and limits each amendment to one topic. It also sets standards for the publication and timing of notices about amendments. Additionally, the bill bans foreign governments and foreign political parties from sponsoring or financially supporting amendment campaigns, ensuring that only domestic entities influence the state's constitutional changes. These changes aim to make the process clearer and to prevent foreign interference in Missouri's constitutional decisions.
