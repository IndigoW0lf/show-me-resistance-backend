summary_short: "A proposed constitutional change to dissolve the current highways commission and create a new Department of Transportation overseen by a director appointed by the governor."
summary: |
  This bill proposes amending the Missouri Constitution to eliminate the existing highways and transportation commission and replace it with a Department of Transportation directly overseen by a governor-appointed director. The new department would have authority over all state highways and other transportation systems like railroads, airports, and ports. It also outlines how transportation-related taxes, particularly fuel taxes, would be managed and distributed. The goal is to make transportation decision-making more centralized under the department rather than a commission, affecting how transportation projects are managed and funded across the state.
