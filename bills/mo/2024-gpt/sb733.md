summary_short: "This bill changes how personal property taxes are assessed and phased down in Missouri, with adjustments starting in 2025."
summary: |
  This legislation updates the rules for taxing personal property (like vehicles, equipment, and items not attached to land) in Missouri. Starting in 2025, it sets a new formula where personal property will be assessed at a decreasing percentage of its true value over time, aiming to balance property tax revenue with real property growth. The bill also requires reassessment of real estate and improvements annually and includes provisions for state reimbursements if local tax revenues decrease due to these changes. These modifications will affect local governments, property owners, and those involved in property assessment and taxation.
