summary_short: "This bill allows individuals with work experience in other states to get a temporary license to practice certain professions in Missouri for up to two years."
summary: |
  The bill makes it easier for people who have at least three years of work experience in a similar profession in other states or the District of Columbia to work temporarily in Missouri. It grants a one-time, nonrenewable two-year license in their profession, provided they meet certain requirements like passing state-specific exams and showing proof of citizenship. This helps qualified workers to practice temporarily while they pursue permanent licensure. Certain occupations, such as those already covered by interstate agreements or federal rules, are not affected by this new rule.
