summary: |
  This bill changes the rules about how recordings or photos of minors who are victims or witnesses are handled during investigations and legal proceedings. It generally prohibits copying or sharing these types of evidence unless a court specifically orders it and ensures safety and privacy. Access is mainly limited to specific professionals involved in investigation and child protection, such as law enforcement, healthcare providers, and social services. When order is given, it must only be for the case at hand, and all copies must be returned or destroyed after the case ends. The bill also allows multidisciplinary team members to view evidence without copying it, balancing investigation needs with the child's privacy and safety.
