summary: |
  The bill, SB853, revises Missouri laws about how long people have to start legal actions after an event occurs. It sets new deadlines for various types of cases, such as contract disputes, personal injuries, fraud claims, and claims against insurance companies. For example, most contract-related lawsuits must now be filed within five years, while personal injury claims must be brought within two years. These changes affect anyone involved in legal disputes in Missouri, including individuals, businesses, and insurance companies, by clarifying how long they have to take legal action after an incident or disagreement.
