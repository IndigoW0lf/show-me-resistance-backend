  This bill repeals and rewrites existing laws related to motor fuel tax exemptions in Missouri. It clearly defines when and how certain groups, like farmers, those using fuel for nonhighway purposes, and exporters, can be exempt from paying fuel taxes. The bill specifies that farmers who buy large amounts of gasoline for agricultural purposes can claim refunds, and it outlines conditions for fuel used in aircraft, heating, and railroads to be tax-exempt. It also provides rules for businesses that export fuel or purchase it for use outside the state, allowing them to reduce or recover the taxes paid. Overall, the bill aims to make the exemption process clearer for consumers, producers, and businesses, ensuring they understand when they do not need to pay certain fuel taxes.
