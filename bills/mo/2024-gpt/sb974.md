summary_short: "Public school shower rooms, locker rooms, and restrooms must be designated by biological sex, with accommodations available for students whose gender identity differs from their biological sex."
summary: |
  This bill requires all public schools to ensure that shower rooms, locker rooms, and restrooms used by students are designated for and used only by students of the same biological sex, based on their physical anatomy at birth. If a student identifies as a different gender, they can request alternative facilities, such as single-stall or unisex bathrooms, but only with written permission from a parent or guardian. The law is designed to protect students' privacy and safety by keeping facilities separate and providing options for students whose gender identity does not match their biological sex.
