summary_short: "This bill increases the government funds available to support regional planning groups in Missouri, with amounts adjusted annually for inflation."

summary: |
  This bill changes the way Missouri funds regional planning commissions, which help coordinate efforts across different parts of the state. It sets a fixed amount of state money that will be matched by local funding for these groups. The bill also caps the total state support for some larger commissions and provides a yearly increase based on inflation starting in July 2025. This means that these planning groups will have more reliable and potentially increased funding to improve regional development and planning efforts. The bill affects local governments and regional planning organizations in Missouri.
