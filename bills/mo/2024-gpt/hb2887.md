summary_short: "This bill repeals the sales tax on food and introduces a new estate tax starting in 2025 to offset the lost revenue."
summary: |
  The bill removes the state's 1% sales tax on food sales beginning January 1, 2025, except for local taxes. It defines which foods are taxed, focusing only on items that can be bought with food assistance benefits and excluding prepared foods from restaurants and similar businesses. To make up for the loss in revenue from ending the food tax, the bill creates a new estate tax that will start in 2025, taxing larger estates worth $25,000 or more that are transferred after death. The estate tax rates will be set by the Department of Revenue to generate roughly the same revenue as the food sales tax did. This change affects consumers buying food and individuals inheriting estates in Missouri, as well as state revenue and school funding.
