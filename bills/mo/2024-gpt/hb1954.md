summary_short: "This bill changes how certain confidential information related to probation and parole is handled and shared in Missouri courts."
summary: |
  The bill updates laws about the handling of information collected during probation and parole processes. It requires court clerks to keep detailed records of applications, investigations, and court orders related to probation and parole. It also makes information gathered by probation and parole officers confidential and limits who can see it—primarily only parole boards, judges, and certain court officials. However, the report used in sentencing can be shared with the state if the court determines it’s in the best interest of the state. Overall, the bill aims to protect sensitive information while clarifying what can be shared and who has access.
