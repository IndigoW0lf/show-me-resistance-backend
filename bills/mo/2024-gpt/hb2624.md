summary: |
  The "End Organ Harvesting Act of 2024" is a new law in Missouri that prohibits health insurance plans, including Medicaid and state programs, from paying for organ transplants or related care if the organs are taken from countries that participate in forced organ harvesting. Forced organ harvesting involves removing organs from living people or killing them to get their organs, often through coercion or deception. The law specifically targets organs sourced from China or other countries identified by the health department as participating in such practices. It aims to prevent the use of ethically questionable organs in transplants and promote ethical sourcing practices for organ transplantation.
