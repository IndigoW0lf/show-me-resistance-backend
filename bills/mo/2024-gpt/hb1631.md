summary_short: "This law creates a tax credit for parents who experience a stillbirth starting in 2025."

summary: |
  This bill allows parents in Missouri who have a stillbirth—meaning the baby was born dead—to receive a $1,200 tax credit on their state income taxes each year they have a stillbirth. It applies to individuals who pay Missouri income taxes, excluding certain withholding taxes. The credit can only be claimed in the year the stillbirth occurs and cannot be carried over to other years or sold to others. The program for this tax credit is temporary, lasting up to 12 years if reauthorized, and all rules for administering it will be set by the Department of Revenue.
