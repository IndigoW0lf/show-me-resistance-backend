summary: |
  The "Cronkite New Voices Act" ensures that high school students in Missouri can freely create, publish, and share media as part of school-sponsored activities without fear of censorship. It states that student journalists have the right to express opinions and report on controversial topics, as long as it does not violate laws or school rules. Schools and media advisors can only limit content in specific cases such as libel, invasion of privacy, threats of violence, or illegal activities, and cannot suppress student work based on disagreement with the content. This law aims to support free and responsible student journalism while protecting students and teachers from unjust restrictions.
