summary_short: "Ensures fire protection districts continue serving annexed areas and receive payment from cities in certain counties."
summary: |
  This bill states that when a city in a first or second class county annexes an area, the local fire protection district still has to provide fire services to that area. The city must pay the fire district each year an amount based on the area's assessed property value and tax rate. Residents in the annexed area will still be able to vote in fire district elections and run for the district's governing board. This law helps ensure ongoing fire protection and fair compensation for districts after annexation.
