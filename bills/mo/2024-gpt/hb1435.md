summary_short: "Allows electrical companies to charge for costs related to building new nuclear power plants before they are complete."
summary: |
  This bill lets electrical companies in Missouri charge customers for some costs of constructing new nuclear power plants before those plants are fully operational. Normally, charges based on construction costs in progress are considered unjust or unreasonable. The law aims to support the development of clean, nuclear-based electricity plants in Missouri, but it excludes plants that are already in service before August 28, 2024. This bill encourages cleaner energy projects and provides rules for how companies can recover their construction expenses through rates, ultimately impacting electricity consumers and utility companies.
