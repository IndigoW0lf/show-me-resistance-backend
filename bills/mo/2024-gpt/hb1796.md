summary_short: "This bill abolishes municipal courts in Missouri and replaces them with new legal procedures."
summary: |
  The bill removes the existing municipal courts in Missouri, which are courts that handle local city-level legal cases. It repeals numerous laws that established and governed these courts. By doing so, it changes how certain legal cases and local law enforcement records are managed, affecting city officials, law enforcement agencies, and residents involved in local legal matters. The goal is to create a new legal framework for handling city-level offenses and judicial processes.
