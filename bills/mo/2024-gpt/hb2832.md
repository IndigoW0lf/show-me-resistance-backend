summary_short: "This bill changes the rules for selecting members of the Missouri Public Service Commission to increase the number from five to seven, with specific experience and residency requirements."
summary: |
  The bill updates the law governing the Missouri Public Service Commission, increasing its membership from five to seven members. These members will be appointed by the governor with approval from the Senate, and no more than one can come from each congressional district. The bill also sets specific experience requirements for members, such as one with finance experience, one with utility sector experience, and at least two who have farming background. Each member must be a Missouri resident for at least five years, at least 25 years old, and registered to vote in Missouri. The term length for commissioners is six years, and vacancies will be filled by the governor for the remaining unexpired term. This change affects the appointment process and composition of the Public Service Commission, which oversees utilities and public services in Missouri.
