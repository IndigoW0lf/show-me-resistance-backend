summary: |
  This Missouri bill sets new rules for products like foods, cosmetics, vaccines, and medical treatments that could affect a person's genes or spread diseases. Companies must put clear labels on products that might act as gene therapy or could expose others to genetic or infectious risks. Additionally, producers and distributors must provide information about how people might be exposed to these products, even if they haven't directly used them. The goal is to increase transparency and help consumers understand potential health and genetic risks associated with certain products.
