summary_short: "This bill updates the law about giving explicit sexual material to students and makes it a misdemeanor for school staff to do so."
summary: |
  The bill changes existing laws to specify that school staff or other officials working in schools who knowingly give, share, or show explicit sexual material to students could be charged with a Class A misdemeanor. It clearly defines what counts as explicit sexual material, including videos, pictures, or written content showing sexual acts or genital stimulation, but exempts certain educational or artistic materials taken as a whole. The law applies to many school-affiliated individuals like teachers, administrators, librarians, coaches, and guest speakers, but not students. This aims to protect students from exposure to inappropriate content and clarifies the responsibilities of school staff.
