summary_short: "Adds more options for photo ID required to vote in Missouri elections."

summary: |
  This bill updates Missouri's voter ID rules to include additional forms of photo identification. Voters will now be able to use Missouri driver’s licenses, student or employee IDs from Missouri schools, or certain military and veteran IDs to prove who they are when voting. If someone doesn’t have acceptable ID at the polling place, they can still vote a provisional ballot, but their identity will need to be verified later. The goal is to make voting more flexible while ensuring that voters are properly identified.
