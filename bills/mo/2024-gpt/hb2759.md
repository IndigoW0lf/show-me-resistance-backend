summary_short: "This bill requires blood banks to test donated blood for COVID-19 and other mRNA vaccine components and label any positive tests accordingly."
summary: |
  The bill mandates that blood banks in Missouri must test all donated blood for evidence of COVID-19 vaccines and similar mRNA vaccine components, such as spike proteins and lipid nanoparticles. If the blood tests positive for these components, the blood must be labeled to indicate this status. The labeled blood cannot be used for transfusions unless certain conditions are met, including that the recipient or their representative is informed and has an opportunity to refuse the labeled blood. This law affects blood donation and transfusion processes, as well as individuals who donate or receive blood in the state.
