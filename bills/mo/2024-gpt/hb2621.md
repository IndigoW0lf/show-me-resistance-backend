summary: |
  The bill prohibits all public and private medical schools in Missouri from offering any training related to abortion procedures to students, residents, or fellows. It also restricts these schools from working with institutions outside Missouri to provide such training. The goal is to prevent medical students from receiving education or instruction about abortion techniques, except in cases of medical emergencies. This affects medical students, educational institutions, and healthcare providers in Missouri, limiting their exposure to or knowledge of abortion procedures during training.
