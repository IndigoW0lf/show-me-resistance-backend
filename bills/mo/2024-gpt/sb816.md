summary: |
  This bill updates the rules for electronic voting systems used in Missouri elections. It requires the Secretary of State to approve voting machines before they can be used, making sure they are safe, private, and accurate. The bill also specifies that these systems must be tested and certified by an independent agency and developed by U.S.-based companies owned by U.S. citizens. Additionally, it allows for the use of computerized voting systems that include a paper trail for verification. These changes aim to make voting more secure, transparent, and trustworthy for voters and election officials.
