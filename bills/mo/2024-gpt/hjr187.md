summary: |
  This bill seeks to change Missouri's constitution to control how much the state government can spend each year by setting limits based on population growth and available revenue. It also establishes a new "Tax Reform Fund" that collects surplus revenue to help cover budget shortfalls and potentially reduce personal income taxes if certain financial conditions are met. These changes aim to ensure responsible spending and provide funds that can be used to lower taxes when the state's revenues are strong. The bill affects state government operations, taxpayers, and those involved in budget planning and tax policy.
