summary: |
  The bill changes the rules for child care programs that operate on elementary or secondary school property and only serve school-age children. It states that these programs must follow the same licensing rules as other child care providers. However, for safety, health, and fire reasons, the buildings and premises used by these programs will be considered compliant with licensing requirements without needing additional inspections. This affects programs run within schools and aims to ensure safety while reducing some licensing burdens.
