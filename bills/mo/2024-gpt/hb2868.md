summary: |
  The bill updates Missouri law to specify when and how information about a personâ€™s HIV testing and status can be shared. It states that this sensitive information must be kept confidential unless certain public officials, law enforcement, caregivers, victims of crimes, the tested individual, or health insurance providers need it for their official duties. The law aims to balance privacy with the safe sharing of important health data for treatment, legal, or safety reasons, affecting healthcare providers, law enforcement, and public agencies.
