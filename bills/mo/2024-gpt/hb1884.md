summary: |
  HB1884 makes changes to Missouri’s laws on income tax refunds. It clarifies what counts as a debt that might reduce or offset a taxpayer’s refund, including debts to the state or court-related obligations. The bill also updates who the government considers a "state agency," including certain large cities, when it comes to collecting debts. These changes mean that some debts, like unpaid taxes or support obligations, can now more easily affect a person's income tax refund, providing clearer rules for both taxpayers and government agencies.
