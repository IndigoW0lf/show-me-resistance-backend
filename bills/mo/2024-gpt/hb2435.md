summary: |
  This bill changes the way Missouri handles property tax credits for seniors who are at least 62 years old and own their home. It sets clear rules about how the credit is calculated, based on the property tax increase from a specific base year. Local counties can choose to offer this credit either through a county ordinance or by holding a voter referendum. The purpose is to help senior homeowners better manage rising property taxes and make the tax process more transparent. It mainly affects eligible seniors, county governments, and property tax administration.
