summary_short: "This bill clarifies that licensed healthcare professionals and quality improvement activities are protected under peer review confidentiality laws in Missouri."

summary: |
  The bill amends Missouri law to specify that anyone licensed as a healthcare professional, such as doctors or nurses, is considered a health care professional for the purposes of peer review protections. It also states that activities related to quality improvement or quality assurance—important steps to improve healthcare practices—are considered part of peer review committees. This means that discussions and reviews related to healthcare quality will remain confidential and protected from public disclosure, promoting honest evaluation and safer patient care. It primarily affects licensed healthcare providers and organizations involved in healthcare quality activities.
