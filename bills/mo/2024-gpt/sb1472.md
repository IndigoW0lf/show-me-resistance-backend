summary: |
  The bill creates new rules to ensure that products can be repaired more easily by defining terms like authorized repair providers and independent repair shops. It requires manufacturers to share certain repair documentation, software, and parts with authorized repair providers under fair conditions. The bill helps protect consumers' right to repair their products and supports independent repair businesses by establishing clear guidelines and penalties for non-compliance. It mainly affects manufacturers, repair providers, and consumers who own products that can be repaired, but excludes motor vehicles.
