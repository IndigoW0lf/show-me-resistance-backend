summary_short: "This law prevents discrimination based on hair texture or protective hairstyles in educational programs that get state funding."
summary: |
  This bill, called the Missouri CROWN Act, makes it illegal for educational institutions that receive state funding to discriminate against students or staff because of their hair texture or protective hairstyles like braids, locks, or afros. It recognizes that certain hairstyles are often linked to race and aims to promote respectful and inclusive environments. The law applies to both public and private schools and covers any program that benefits from state financial assistance or serves students receiving state aid. However, religious schools may be exempt if the law conflicts with their religious beliefs. The bill ensures everyone can wear their natural hair without fear of discrimination in educational settings.
