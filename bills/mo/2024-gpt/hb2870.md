summary: |
  The Missouri Building Codes Act sets new statewide standards for building construction and inspections. It requires any new facilities built for the state of Missouri after the law takes effect to follow specific building codes related to safety, energy, fire prevention, electrical, plumbing, and property maintenance. Local authorities such as counties, fire districts, and municipalities can adopt these codes by referencing model codes developed by recognized organizations like the International Code Council and the National Fire Protection Association. The law also streamlines how authorities implement these codes, ensuring consistency across the state and improving building safety for residents and government facilities.
