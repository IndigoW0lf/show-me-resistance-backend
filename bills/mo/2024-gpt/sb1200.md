summary_short: "This bill creates a program allowing eligible individuals charged with DUI to have their case diverted into a rehabilitation plan instead of immediate punishment."

summary: |
  This bill sets up a new program in Missouri to help people charged with driving while intoxicated (DWI) avoid traditional criminal penalties by completing a diversion program. If a person accused of a DWI meets certain conditions—such as not having previous convictions, not being involved in an accident or injury, and not holding a commercial driver’s license—they may have their case paused and transferred into this program with court approval. During this program, they might be required to install an ignition interlock device, attend victim impact panels, and comply with other conditions. Successfully completing the program can lead to the dismissal of the charges and the suspension or revocation of their driver’s license will be handled accordingly. This initiative aims to promote responsible driving and give offenders a chance to avoid harsher consequences.
