summary: |
  This bill changes the rules about who can own agricultural land in Missouri. It states that starting from when the bill becomes law, no foreign person or company can buy or transfer agricultural land in the state. Previously, some restrictions allowed limited foreign ownership if it was below 1%, but now all foreign ownership is prohibited. This affects foreign individuals, companies, and governments who wanted to buy or sell farmland in Missouri, ensuring that only U.S. citizens and residents can own such land.
