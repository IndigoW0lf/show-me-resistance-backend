summary: |
  This bill aims to make insulin more affordable by setting a limit on how much insurance customers must pay for a 30-day supply of prescription insulinâ€”no more than $100. Starting January 1, 2025, this $100 limit will increase annually based on changes in medical costs. The bill also requires state departments to study and report on how insulin prices are set and look for ways to prevent overpricing. It affects insurance plans issued or renewed after August 28, 2024, and will help people who rely on insulin to manage diabetes by making their treatment more affordable.
