summary_short: "This bill reduces sales tax on feminine hygiene products and diapers starting October 1, 2024, and considers allowing government assistance programs to cover these items."
summary: |
  The bill changes the law so that starting October 1, 2024, the sales tax on feminine hygiene products (like tampons, pads, liners, and cups) and diapers will be no higher than the tax rate applied to food. This means these essential products will become more affordable for consumers. Additionally, the bill explores the possibility of allowing programs like SNAP and WIC to be used to buy diapers and feminine hygiene items if the U.S. Department of Agriculture grants a waiver. This change aims to make these important items more accessible and reduce the financial burden on families.
