summary: |
  This bill urges the Missouri Department of Transportation to impose a minimum five-year ban on installing or upgrading billboards along Interstate 70 while the highway is being rebuilt. It also creates a House Commission on Interstate 70 Beautification to study ways to enhance the safety and visual appeal of the highway through landscaping and sign control. The goal is to preserve Missouri's natural beauty, improve safety for drivers, and support tourism and local businesses. This affects highway construction plans, outdoor advertising companies, local communities, and travelers along the I-70 corridor.
