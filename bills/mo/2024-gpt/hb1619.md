summary_short: "This bill sets rules for honoring individuals as state holidays in Missouri."

summary: |
  Starting January 1, 2024, Missouri will require that a person must have been deceased for at least three years before they can be honored with a state holiday, unless they died while serving in the military or as a first responder, in which case they only need to have been deceased for at least one year. This rule applies when the state legislature designates a day to honor a specific individual. The law aims to ensure that those who are recognized have been deceased for a sufficient amount of time, with special consideration for fallen service members and first responders.
