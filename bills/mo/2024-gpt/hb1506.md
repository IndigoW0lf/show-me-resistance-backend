summary: |
  The bill mandates that the governor’s office regularly updates and publishes a list of all state boards, commissions, committees, and councils that have members appointed by the governor. This list will include each member’s name, where they live, and when their term ends. Starting September 1, 2024, the governor’s website will also show photos of current appointees and any vacancies. The goal is to make information about government appointees more transparent and accessible to the public, helping residents better understand who is involved in state government decision-making.
