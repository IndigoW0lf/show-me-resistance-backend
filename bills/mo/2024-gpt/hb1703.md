summary_short: "This law allows prosecutors to refile some cases dismissed before a preliminary hearing, but limits refiling if the case is dismissed twice."
summary: |
  Under this new law, if a case is scheduled for a preliminary hearing but is dismissed by the court before the hearing happens, the prosecutor can refile the case. When refiling, a warrant for the defendant's arrest cannot be issued, but a summons can be sent to require the defendant to appear in court. The defendant will not need to post bond for the case. However, if the case is dismissed a second time, the prosecutor is not allowed to refile it again. This change affects prosecutors and defendants involved in criminal cases, providing a specific process for handling dismissed cases.
