summary: |
  This bill lets private schools that meet the same state requirements as public schools receive public funding for each student they enroll, beginning with the 2025-26 school year. Private schools that do not meet these requirements will not be eligible for funding. The purpose is to expand access to public money for certain private schools that follow state education rules, potentially affecting students, families, and private school institutions in Missouri.
