summary_short: "This bill bans zero-tolerance discipline policies in Missouri public schools that automatically punish students without considering individual circumstances."

summary: |
  This bill requires all school districts in Missouri to stop using zero-tolerance discipline policies that automatically assign punishments like suspension or expulsion without reviewing each case. Instead, schools must have the discretion to decide on appropriate consequences based on individual situations. The goal is to make school discipline fairer and more thoughtful, ensuring students are treated fairly and case decisions are made on a case-by-case basis. This change affects students, teachers, and school administrators across the state.
