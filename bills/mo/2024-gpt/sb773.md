summary: |
  This bill mandates that public schools have automated external defibrillators (AEDs) on their campuses to respond to cardiac emergencies. It defines what an AED is, how it works, and who can use it safely â€” including school staff who receive proper training. The bill also designates a program coordinator responsible for managing the AED program at each school. The goal is to improve emergency responses to sudden cardiac arrests at schools, making sure students and staff are protected and emergency help can be provided quickly.
