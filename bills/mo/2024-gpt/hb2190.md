summary_short: "Missouri health insurance plans will cover self-administered hormonal contraceptives starting January 1, 2025."
summary: |
  This bill requires health insurance plans in Missouri to cover the cost of self-administered hormonal contraceptives, such as birth control pills or patches, that are approved by the FDA. Starting January 1, 2025, insurance plans must reimburse healthcare providers for supplying up to a year's supply of these contraceptives. The coverage cannot have higher deductibles or co-pays than other similar health services, making it easier and more affordable for people to access birth control from their health insurance.
