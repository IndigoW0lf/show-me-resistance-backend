summary: |
  This law requires specific health agencies and organizations in Missouri, such as the Department of Health, public and private hospitals, and laboratories, to collect and publicly share demographic information. The types of data include race, ethnicity, language, gender identity, age, disability, income, employment, veteran status, family size, education, and religion. These agencies must gather this information regularly and post it online while protecting personal privacy, meaning individual identities cannot be identified from the data. The goal is to improve understanding of different communities and health disparities across the state, while ensuring data privacy and reliability.
