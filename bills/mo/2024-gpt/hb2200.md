summary: |
  This bill changes the current rules for appealing property tax assessments. Normally, people have to file their appeal by the second Monday in July. Under this new law, individuals who are 62 years old or older will have an additional 30 days beyond that deadline to submit their appeal. This change applies to appeals made at the county level and helps seniors have more time to challenge their property assessments if they believe they are unfair.
