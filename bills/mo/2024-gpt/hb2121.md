summary_short: "The CARE Act requires hospitals and healthcare facilities to inform sexual assault victims about emergency contraception and provide it immediately if requested, along with STI treatment."

summary: |
  This bill, called the Compassionate Assistance for Rape Emergencies (CARE) Act, mandates that hospitals and healthcare facilities must tell sexual assault victims about the availability of emergency contraception (such as Plan B) and provide it right away if the victims choose to use it. The law also requires these facilities to offer testing and treatment for sexually transmitted infections. The goal is to ensure victims receive prompt, compassionate care to prevent pregnancy and address potential infections after an assault, making the process more supportive and accessible. The Department of Health will create rules to carry out these requirements.
