summary: |
  This bill sets up a new "Task Force on Distributed Energy Resources and Net Metering" to explore how to better support renewable energy and solar power in Missouri. The group will include lawmakers, energy officials, utility representatives, renewable energy advocates, and low-income customer representatives. They will hold public hearings, research the benefits and challenges of local solar energy, and suggest possible laws to improve consumer protections, community solar projects, and fair rates. The task force will deliver a report with recommendations to the legislature by the end of 2026, which could impact energy policies, utility practices, and how solar benefits and costs are shared among consumers.
