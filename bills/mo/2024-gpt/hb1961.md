summary_short: "This bill requires state agencies to cancel two existing rules before creating a new one to ensure rules are necessary and lawful."

summary: |
  The bill changes the rules for how state government agencies make and approve regulations. Now, before a department or agency can put a new rule into effect, they must first remove at least two existing rules. This helps prevent agencies from adding new rules without removing outdated or unnecessary ones, making sure regulations stay clear, lawful, and fair for everyone impacted.
