summary_short: "The bill stops counties from charging interest on the entire property tax bill when a taxpayer makes installment payments."
summary: |
  This bill changes how counties handle late property tax payments. It allows taxpayers to pay their property taxes in installments—such as annually, semiannually, or quarterly—based on estimates from the previous year. Importantly, counties can only charge interest on the unpaid portion of the tax at the time of each missed or late installment, not on the entire tax bill. If a taxpayer overpays their taxes, the county must refund the excess amount once a year, but without paying interest on the refund. This bill applies to most taxpayers but does not include payments made by financial institutions through escrow accounts. It helps taxpayers avoid paying interest on taxes they’ve already paid, making property tax payments more flexible and fair.
