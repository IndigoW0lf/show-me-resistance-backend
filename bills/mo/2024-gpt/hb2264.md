summary: |
  This bill makes changes to how counties in Missouri handle personal property taxes. It allows county governments to provide options for taxpayers to pay their personal property taxes in parts, especially making semiannual payments available. Taxpayers can choose to pay either current or overdue taxes twice a year, and counties can charge interest on overdue amounts. The bill also clarifies rules for paying property taxes on an annual or quarterly basis and defines how payments are to be estimated and processed. This change affects taxpayers who own personal property, such as vehicles or business equipment, by giving them greater flexibility in payment options.
