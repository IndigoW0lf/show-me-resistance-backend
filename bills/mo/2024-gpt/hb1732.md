summary_short: "This bill updates the laws about compensation for public safety workers killed in the line of duty in Missouri."

summary: |
  The bill repeals the old law and introduces a new section that explains who qualifies for "Line of Duty Compensation," including specific roles like firefighters, emergency medical technicians, and air ambulance staff. It clarifies the definitions of who is considered a public safety officer and when someone is considered "killed in the line of duty," such as during accidents or acts of violence related to their work. The changes help ensure that more public safety workers and their families are properly recognized and compensated if they tragically lose their lives while performing their official duties in Missouri.
