summary_short: "This bill sets rules for land clearance and eminent domain in redevelopment areas, especially when properties are in distressed communities or contain mortgages."

summary: |
  This bill creates new rules for redevelopment authorities in Missouri that use eminent domain to acquire land. Specifically, it applies when the land is in an area designated as distressed or within a qualified census tract. The law requires these authorities to consider mortgage holders when compensating properties they acquire, including paying any remaining mortgage debt if the property is sold through condemnation. The goal is to protect property owners and ensure fair treatment during land clearance for redevelopment projects, especially in areas needing revitalization due to blight or health concerns.
