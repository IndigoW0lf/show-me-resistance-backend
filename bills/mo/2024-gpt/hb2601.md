summary: |
  This bill, known as "Valentine's Law," makes it a criminal offense in Missouri to intentionally flee from a traffic stop or vehicle detention in a dangerous way. If a person tries to escape and does so at high speed, risking serious injury or death, or if their fleeing causes injury or death to others, they could face serious charges. The law applies even if the police officers are acting unlawfully. Penalties vary based on the severity: it is considered a felony with harsher penalties for causing harm or death, and individuals canâ€™t be eligible for probation or early release if convicted.
