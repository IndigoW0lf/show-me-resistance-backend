summary_short: "Missouri will require licensing to sell firearm ammunition starting after December 31, 2024."
summary: |
  This bill changes the law so that beginning after December 31, 2024, anyone who sells firearm ammunition in Missouri must be officially licensed by the Secretary of State. Small-scale sales, such as selling up to 100 rounds to one vendor per month or 250 rounds per year, will be exempt. The bill also outlines who can sell ammunition without a license, like hunting clubs and shooting ranges, and sets up a licensing process with criteria, application rules, and fees. It aims to regulate ammunition sales to improve oversight and prevent illegal or unlicensed sales.
