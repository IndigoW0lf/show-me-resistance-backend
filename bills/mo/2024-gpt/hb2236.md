summary_short: "This law limits foreign ownership of agricultural land in Missouri, allowing only up to 1% of all agricultural land to be owned by foreigners and foreign companies."
summary: |
  This bill changes the rules about who can own agricultural land in Missouri. Starting August 28, 2024, foreign individuals and foreign-owned businesses will no longer be allowed to buy or own agricultural land in the state. If they owned land before this date, they cannot sell or transfer it to other foreigners or foreign companies after August 28, 2024. The law aims to ensure that most agricultural land remains in the hands of local residents and entities. It also requires that any future land transfers by foreigners must be reviewed by the Department of Agriculture to make sure they follow these new restrictions.
