summary: |
  The bill changes the rules about disclosing radioactive or hazardous material contamination on properties that are rented, sold, or transferred. Property owners or sellers must tell prospective buyers or tenants if they know the property was contaminated, based on written reports from government agencies. If they fail to do so, they could be charged with a misdemeanor, and tenants may be able to terminate their lease at no cost. The bill also requires property owners to inform current occupants if a government agency requests testing for hazardous materials, and agencies must notify residents within 30 days if they learn of contamination. It aims to increase transparency and protect residents from exposure to dangerous substances on their property.
