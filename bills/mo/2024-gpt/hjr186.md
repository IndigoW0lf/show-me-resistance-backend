summary: |
  This bill aims to amend the Missouri Constitution so the state can establish a regional district responsible for running and managing Lambert-St. Louis International Airport. The change allows for the creation of a special district that would handle airport operations independently from city or county governments. It affects voters in the St. Louis area, giving them the power to decide on establishing this district through a future election. The goal is to improve airport management and governance by creating a dedicated entity for its administration.
