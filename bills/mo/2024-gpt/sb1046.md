summary_short: "Requires health insurance plans to cover prostheses for hair loss caused by chemotherapy or conditions like alopecia for some age groups."

summary: |
  This bill mandates that certain health insurance plans in Missouri must cover artificial scalp hair prostheses, which are used to replace hair lost due to cancer treatment or conditions like alopecia. Starting January 1, 2025, plans must include this coverage for all policies issued or renewed in the state, with specific limits on the amount payable. For children and teenagers under 18, the coverage is automatic and lasts until age 18, while for others, the plan can provide up to $3,200 per lifetime for a permanent prosthesis. The bill helps reduce financial barriers for people needing these prostheses and clarifies the maximum benefits available.
