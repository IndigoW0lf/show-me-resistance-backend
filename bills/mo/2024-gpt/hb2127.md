summary_short: "This bill allows certain prisoners to have their life sentence or long-term sentence reduced to parole-eligible after meeting specific conditions."

summary: |
  This bill lets judges reduce the sentences of some inmates who have been in prison for at least 30 years and were young when they committed their crimes. If they meet certain standards—like showing good behavior, working on rehabilitation, and not having prior violent felony convictions—the court can change their sentence to life with the possibility of parole. Those inmates must also be supported by community members and have a safe place to live upon release. The parole board will review these cases and decide if the inmate can be released early under supervision, which will continue for their entire life. It aims to give deserving prisoners a second chance while ensuring safety.
