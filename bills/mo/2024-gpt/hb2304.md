summary: |
  This bill mandates that the Missouri Department of Revenue consult the federal Drug and Alcohol Clearinghouse when issuing new commercial driver's licenses or permits, to verify that applicants are following drug and alcohol laws. If an applicant is prohibited from driving due to a violation, their license will be denied. For current license holders, if they are found to be prohibited, their license will be downgraded within 60 days, but can be reinstated if they are no longer barred. The goal is to improve safety by making sure only eligible drivers operate commercial vehicles, affecting both new applicants and current license holders.
