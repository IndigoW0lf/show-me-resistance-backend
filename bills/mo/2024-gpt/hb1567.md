summary_short: "Allows Missouri municipalities to use the principal of their perpetual care cemetery funds for cemetery maintenance and care."
summary: |
  This bill lets towns, cities, and villages in Missouri use the original money (principal) in their cemetery care funds if their income isn't enough to cover maintenance needs. Usually, only the earnings (net income) from the fund can be spent on caring for cemeteries, but this bill permits the use of the fund's principal when necessary. It also clarifies how these funds can be invested and how towns and cities can accept donations for cemetery upkeep. The changes affect local governments that manage cemeteries and their cemetery funds.
