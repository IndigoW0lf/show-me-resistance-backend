  The bill sets up a program where the Missouri Department of Economic Development can give financial grants to businesses in the state to help pay for cybersecurity improvements. Employers can receive up to 90% of the costs for projects like purchasing hardware and software, training staff, and hiring cybersecurity experts. The program is aimed at small to medium-sized businesses and is limited to $10 million per year. To qualify, businesses must apply online, show how they plan to spend the funds, and cover at least 10% of the costs themselves. The goal is to strengthen cybersecurity across Missouri and protect local jobs and data.
