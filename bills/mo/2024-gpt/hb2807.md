summary: |
  This bill allows parents who experience a spontaneous fetal death, which is a loss of a fetus before birth that occurs naturally, to claim a $2,000 tax credit on their Missouri state taxes for that year. The credit can only be claimed in the same year the death happened and if the child would have been a dependent. It cannot be carried over to future years, sold, or transferred. The purpose is to provide some financial relief to families facing this tragic event. The Missouri Department of Revenue will set up rules to verify these claims, and the program will automatically end after six years unless the law is reauthorized.
