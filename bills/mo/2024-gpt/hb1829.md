summary_short: "The bill sets rules for air ambulance memberships to protect consumers and ensure clarity, especially for Medicaid recipients."

summary: |
  This bill creates new regulations for air ambulance membership plans in Missouri. It prevents these plans from being sold to people enrolled in Medicaid (MO HealthNet). The bill requires organizations offering these memberships to clearly explain that they are not insurance, that Medicaid covers air ambulance services without cost, and that state laws may restrict Medicaid beneficiaries from joining such plans. It also mandates transparent marketing materials and application forms, and requires organizations to handle enrollments carefully if someone later joins Medicaid. Overall, the law aims to protect consumers and make sure they understand what they are signing up for.
