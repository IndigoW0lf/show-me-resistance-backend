summary: |
  The bill changes the judicial structure for the 32nd Judicial Circuit, which includes Perry, Bollinger, and Cape Girardeau counties. It adds a third judge position, making three total judges instead of two. Additionally, it specifies when each judge will be elected or appointed: one judge in 1982, another in 1984, and a third judge appointed by the governor who will serve until 2029, with a subsequent election planned for 2028. This affects residents in these counties by potentially improving judicial coverage and access to justice.
