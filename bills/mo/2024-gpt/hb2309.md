summary: |
  This bill, called the "Defining SEX Act," establishes clear, biological definitions for terms like male, female, boy, girl, man, and woman. It states that "sex" refers to a person's biological characteristics and separates the concept of "gender" (how people experience or express themselves) from "sex." The law also protects individuals with certain medical conditions related to sex development under disability laws. It primarily affects legal and governmental language about sex and gender, ensuring that biological definitions are used consistently.
