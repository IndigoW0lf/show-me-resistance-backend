summary_short: "This bill requires paint manufacturers to create recycling programs for leftover paint and prevents the sale of paint without such a program in place."

summary: |
  The bill mandates that companies which produce architectural paint (used inside and outside buildings) in Missouri must set up a paint recycling program. These companies can join or create a nonprofit group to manage this program, which must collect, reuse, or properly dispose of leftover paint instead of sending it to waste. Additionally, the bill prohibits selling paint in stores unless the manufacturer has a recycling plan approved and operational. The goal is to reduce paint waste, protect the environment, and ensure responsible management of leftover paint for consumers, retailers, and paint producers.
