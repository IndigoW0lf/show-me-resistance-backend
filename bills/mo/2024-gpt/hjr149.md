summary: |
  The bill, known as HJR149, suggests changing Missouri's constitution to explicitly guarantee the right of all citizens to possess and carry firearms, ammunition, and related accessories. It states that these rights are unalienable and must be upheld by the state, with any restrictions needing strict legal scrutiny. The bill also allows cities like St. Louis and Kansas City to create their own rules for firearm permits, including issuing permits, setting fees, and enforcing penalties, but with certain exceptions for law enforcement, military, and licensed security personnel. It affects firearm owners, local governments, law enforcement, and legal providers by defining their rights and responsibilities regarding gun regulation.
