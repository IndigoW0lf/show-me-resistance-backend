  This bill sets up the "Missouri Task Force on Nonprofit Safety and Security" within the Department of Public Safety. The task force will study the security needs of nonprofits that might be targeted by terrorists and will make recommendations to improve their safety. It will also focus on helping these organizations access federal grants for security improvements like training, hiring security personnel, and securing their buildings. The bill creates a special fund to hold money for these security efforts. The task force includes representatives from law enforcement, nonprofit groups, faith-based organizations, and experts on domestic terrorism. It will meet at least four times a year and report its findings annually.
