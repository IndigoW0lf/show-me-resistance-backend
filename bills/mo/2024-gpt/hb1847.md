summary: |
  This bill, HB1847, updates the law to add sports officials working at sporting events to the definition of "special victims." This means that if a sports official is assaulted while doing their job, they will have certain legal protections and potentially stronger penalties for assault. The law already protects other groups like law enforcement officers, emergency personnel, elderly people, and those with disabilities. This change aims to recognize the risks faced by sports officials and ensure they receive appropriate legal safeguards when assaulted during their work.
