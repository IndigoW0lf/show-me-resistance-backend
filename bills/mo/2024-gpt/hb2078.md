summary_short: "This bill allows volunteer fire protection associations to have their dues collected by the county, similar to property taxes, if voters approve."
summary: |
  This bill gives counties in Missouri the authority to collect annual dues from residents and businesses for volunteer fire protection services. If local voters agree through an election, the county can set up an automatic collection process, managed by the county collector, for these dues. The measure applies to volunteer fire departments that are funded by memberships or subscriber fees, but not to those supported by local taxes. It helps ensure volunteer fire associations can reliably collect funding to provide fire protection, particularly in unincorporated areas and certain towns and cities that request this service.
