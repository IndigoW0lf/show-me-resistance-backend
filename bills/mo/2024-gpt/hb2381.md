summary: |
  The "Protecting Missouri's Small Businesses Act" is a new law in Missouri that aims to support small businesses during government shutdowns. If a local government issues a closure that lasts at least 21 consecutive days or 45 days total, the law requires the government to waive business license fees for that period and extend those fee waivers for at least six months. Additionally, if the shutdown occurs before June 1, the affected businesses will see a reduction in their property taxes based on how long they were closed. This law helps small businesses recover financially after shutdowns and encourages local governments to consider the economic impact of their shutdown orders.
