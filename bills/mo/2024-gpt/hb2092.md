summary: |
  This bill establishes the "Urban Flight and Rural Needs" Teacher Recruitment and Retention State Scholarship Program, managed by the Department of Elementary and Secondary Education. The program offers scholarships to Missouri students who plan to become teachers and commit to working in essential, hard-to-staff schools or subject areas. The scholarships can cover up to 100% of tuition costs at Missouri colleges or universities and are awarded annually, with increasing numbers over the years. The goal is to attract and retain more qualified teachers in areas that need them most, benefiting students in rural and urban schools facing staffing shortages.
