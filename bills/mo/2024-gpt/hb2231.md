summary_short: "This bill clarifies how cigarette and tobacco taxes are set in Missouri, limiting local governments from raising these taxes without voter approval."
summary: |
  This legislation changes existing laws about taxing cigarettes and tobacco products in Missouri. It states that the state government has full authority to set and increase these taxes, and local governments (like cities and counties) cannot pass their own laws to raise tobacco taxes beyond the level set on September 30, 1993, unless voters in that area approve it first. Essentially, it restricts local governments from increasing tobacco taxes unless local voters agree through a direct vote, maintaining the state's control over tobacco taxation.
