summary_short: "Missouri requires firearm owners to have liability insurance covering accidental damages or injuries caused by their guns."

summary: |
  This bill makes it so that anyone who owns or has a firearm in Missouri must get and keep insurance that covers accidents involving their guns. This insurance must be from an insurer authorized to do business in Missouri and cover things like injuries, death, or property damage caused by accidental gun use. If a person owns a firearm but loses or has it stolen, they are considered the owner until they report the theft to law enforcement. Those who already own firearms when the law starts will have 30 days to get the required insurance. This law aims to increase responsibility among gun owners and make sure damages caused by firearms are financially covered.
