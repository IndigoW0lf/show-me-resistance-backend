summary: |
  This bill changes the rules about reporting child abuse or neglect by religious leaders and organizations. It clarifies that communications made to a minister or clergy member, which are usually protected as private or privileged, can be reported if they involve suspected child abuse or neglect. Religious leaders and organizations are required to report suspected abuse or neglect of children, just like other professionals, to protect children's safety. The law aims to balance respect for religious communications with the need to prevent and respond to child abuse.
