summary_short: "This bill changes how state departments sharing revenue from natural resources money gives funds to counties and schools."
summary: |
  The bill requires state agencies that earn money from managing natural resources to share a portion of that revenue with local counties and school districts where the resources are located. Specifically, these agencies can keep 25% of the revenue above their operational costs, while the remaining 75% must be divided: half to the county general fund and a quarter to local school districts. The rule will take effect starting January 1 after voters approve a related constitutional change. This bill impacts government departments, local governments, and school districts involved with natural resource management.
