summary_short: "This bill changes tax incentives for Missouri companies to boost industrial manufacturing and infrastructure projects by offering new ways to retain and earn tax credits for creating jobs and making investments."

summary: |
  This bill updates the state's rules on tax incentives for companies that create new jobs and invest in Missouri. Qualified companies can now keep a portion of their withholding taxes for up to five or six years, depending on whether they are new or existing businesses, if they create enough high-wage jobs and make investments. Additionally, the state Department of Economic Development can award extra tax credits over five or six years, but only up to certain limits based on the company's new payroll and the project's benefits to the state. These changes aim to encourage companies to expand manufacturing and infrastructure projects in Missouri, creating new jobs and investments that benefit the local economy.
