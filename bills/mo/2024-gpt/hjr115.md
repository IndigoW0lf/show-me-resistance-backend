summary_short: "This bill proposes changing Missouri's constitution to require Jackson County to have an elected county assessor instead of an appointed assessment department."

summary: |
  This bill aims to amend Missouri's Constitution so that Jackson County must have an assessor who is elected by voters, rather than an assessor who is appointed or part of a department. The change would ensure more direct voter control over the county's property assessment processes. This affects residents of Jackson County, government officials, and anyone involved in property taxes, as it increases transparency and accountability in how property values are assessed for tax purposes.
