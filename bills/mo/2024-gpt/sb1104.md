summary: |
  This bill makes changes to how unaccredited school districts in Missouri are governed and supervised by the state. When a district loses accreditation, the state can review its governance, hold public hearings, and decide whether the existing school board continues or if a special administrative board is appointed to run the district. The bill specifies that such a board will have at least seven members, with certain qualifications, to oversee the districtâ€™s operations, finances, and management. These provisions aim to improve district oversight, community involvement, and educational stability in districts that are struggling or unaccredited.
