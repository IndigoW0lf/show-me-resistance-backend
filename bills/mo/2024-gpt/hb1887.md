summary_short: "This bill updates rules for temporary motorcycle instruction permits for teens in Missouri."
summary: |
  This bill increases the age at which teens can get a temporary motorcycle permit from 15.5 to 16 years old, provided they complete a state-approved rider training course. It also limits the use of these permits to six months and imposes new restrictions for riders under 16, such as engine size limits, no nighttime riding, no passengers, and staying within 50 miles of home. These changes aim to improve safety for young motorcycle riders and clarify permit conditions.
