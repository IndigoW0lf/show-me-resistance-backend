summary_short: "This bill proposes an amendment to Missouri's constitution to grant property tax exemptions to senior citizens aged 65 and older."

summary: |
  The bill, SJR66, plans to put a vote before Missouri residents in the 2024 election to change the state’s constitution. If approved, it will allow many senior citizens aged 65 and older to be fully exempt from paying property taxes on their homes and other property. This means that older residents who meet the age requirement won't have to pay property taxes, making it easier for them to afford living in their homes. The bill also clarifies which other types of property—like certain types of business inventory and property used for religious or charitable purposes—may be exempt from taxes under law. The goal is to help senior citizens financially and make property taxes fairer for older residents.
