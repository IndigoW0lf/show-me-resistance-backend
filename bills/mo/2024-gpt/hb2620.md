summary: |
  The bill modifies the rules for who can be considered a "qualified student" to receive benefits from Missouriâ€™s scholarship account program. It defines "qualified students" as children with special needs who have an Individualized Education Plan (IEP) or children from families with income levels at or below 200% of the free and reduced-price lunch standard, provided they meet certain conditions. The changes affect students across Missouri, including those in households with limited income, public school students, and children with disabilities. It aims to make it easier for more students to qualify for financial assistance to attend private or special schools.
