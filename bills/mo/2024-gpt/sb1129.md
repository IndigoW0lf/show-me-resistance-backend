summary: |
  The bill, SB1129, adds a new rule in Missouri that makes electricity, natural gas, water, coal, and materials used to generate or deliver electricity tax-exempt. This means companies and consumers will not have to pay sales tax on these energy products and the equipment used for them. The exemption applies to the state-level sales tax but does not change local sales taxes. Overall, this aims to reduce costs associated with energy production and consumption in the state.
