summary_short: "This bill updates transportation rules for public school students in Missouri, including mile-distance eligibility and funding options."
summary: |
  The bill changes the laws about how public schools in Missouri provide transportation for students. It states that in most districts, students who live more than three and a half miles from school must be transported, while districts can choose to transport other students. Schools can get state funding based on transportation costs for students who live at least one mile away. The bill also allows districts to provide transportation for students less than one mile from school if they are crossing dangerous roads, or if they seek voters' approval and a majority consent to higher taxes for this service. Additionally, the bill lets parents pay for transportation for students who arenâ€™t otherwise eligible, with the cost based on the previous year's expenses.
