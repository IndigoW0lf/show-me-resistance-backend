summary: |  
  SB1022 changes the way the Missouri state government calculates the number of students attending school each day for funding purposes. It defines "average daily attendance" more clearly, including students in summer school and those attending out of district but considered residents of a district. The bill also revises how districts' current operating expenditures are calculated to set fair funding levels, affecting how much federal and state money schools receive based on student attendance and expenses. These updates aim to improve transparency and ensure that school funding accurately reflects student attendance and costs.
