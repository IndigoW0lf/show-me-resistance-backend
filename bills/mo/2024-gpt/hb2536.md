summary: |
  This bill updates the rules for electing school board members. Starting in 2024, school elections will be held every two years on the first Tuesday after the first Monday in November. School board members will serve two-year terms and can only serve up to eight years total. Additionally, the elections will be partisan, meaning candidates will declare their political party or run as independents. These changes affect school districts across the state and aim to make school board elections more aligned with general elections and political representation.
