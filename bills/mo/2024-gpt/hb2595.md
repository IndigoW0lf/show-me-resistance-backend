summary_short: "This bill updates the rules and licensing requirements for summer camps and child care facilities in Missouri."
summary: |
  The bill changes existing laws about summer camps and child care facilities in Missouri. It requires that these camps and facilities have a written license from the Department of Elementary and Secondary Education to operate legally. The bill also keeps a public record of confirmed complaints against licensed camps and facilities. Additionally, it clarifies certain types of care that are not regulated, such as small home care, religious or school-based programs, and camps that mainly provide recreation or education. These updates are aimed at improving safety, transparency, and understanding of child care rules in the state.
