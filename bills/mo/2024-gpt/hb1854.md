summary: |
  The bill, called the "Net Metering and Easy Connection Act," modifies existing laws to make it simpler for people and businesses to install renewable energy systems, like solar panels, that produce up to 100 kilowatts. These systems can send extra electricity back to the utility, and the bill sets clear rules for measuring and billing this energy exchange. It affects utility companies, renewable energy users, and regulators by establishing standards to ensure safe, reliable, and fair connection of small renewable generators to the grid. Overall, it encourages more affordable use of clean energy resources by making the process easier and more transparent.
