summary_short: "Creates a two-year pilot program to help children visit their incarcerated mothers more easily."

summary: |
  This bill establishes a pilot program starting in January 2025 to give children up to 17 years old better access to their mothers who are in prison and still have their parental rights. The program will run for two years at two prisons in Vandalia and Chillicothe, focusing especially on children who live far away — 50 miles or more — from the prison. The program includes providing transportation or other means to help children visit their mothers once a month, with a caretaker attending each visit. After the two years, officials will review and report on how well the program worked and recommend whether to expand it to more facilities.
