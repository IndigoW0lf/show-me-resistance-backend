summary: |
  The bill changes Missouri's laws to permit individuals who have valid concealed carry permits to carry firearms into churches, places of worship, and other religious gatherings. It also revises existing rules about where weapons can be carried and discharges of firearms, specifying situations where carrying or using weapons is illegal. The bill does not apply to law enforcement officers acting in line with their duties. It aims to clarify and update gun laws while allowing permit holders to carry firearms in more places, including religious settings.
