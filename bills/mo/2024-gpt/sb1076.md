summary_short: "This bill sets new rules for how the State of Missouri prepares and approves summaries of ballot measures to ensure clear, accurate, and impartial information for voters."

summary: |
  This legislation changes how Missouri handles summaries of proposed laws and constitutional amendments on ballots. When the legislature proposes a measure without an official summary, the Secretary of State must create a clear, impartial summary within twenty days, with input from legislative leaders and approval by the Attorney General. If an official summary is already provided, it must appear on the ballot and cannot be altered by courts, though the legislature can revise it before a certain deadline. The summary must be no longer than fifty words and must accurately describe the measure without bias or prejudice. These rules aim to make ballot summaries more transparent and fair for voters.
