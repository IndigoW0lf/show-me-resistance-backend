summary: |
  The bill authorizes a new state tax credit to encourage businesses and individuals to make donations to child care providers. This aims to help improve access to child care, especially in areas where it's harder to find, like rural or low-income communities. The tax credit allows donors to reduce their state taxes by 75% of their donation amount, making it easier to support quality child care for families. It affects taxpayers such as companies, charities, and individuals who contribute to child care providers, with the goal of increasing funding and access to child care services across Missouri.
