summary_short: "This law requires the Department of Corrections to provide inmates with identification and helpful documents before they are released, to support their re-entry into society."
summary: |
  This bill makes sure that inmates leaving prison within Missouri receive important documents and identification to help them find jobs and get back on their feet. When inmates with a Missouri address are about to be released, the Department of Corrections will work with the Department of Revenue to provide a state ID if they donâ€™t already have one. They will also give inmates important papers, like their work history, training records, and a resume, to help them find employment after prison. The goal is to make releasing inmates smoother and safer for them and the community.
