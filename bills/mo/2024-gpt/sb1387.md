summary_short: "This bill creates a registration process for certain children's homes that meet specific standards, instead of requiring a license."
summary: |
  This bill allows some children’s homes to register with a qualified association instead of getting a traditional license. The association must be well-established, have written standards, and be overseen by a board of directors. Homes that choose to register must file annual information about their facility, staff, and children in care, and follow safety and child welfare standards. Children in these homes must have a written contract with the facility outlining their care, and homes must prove they meet health and safety requirements. This new process aims to provide a clear, regulated way for certain children’s homes to operate while ensuring children’s safety and well-being.
