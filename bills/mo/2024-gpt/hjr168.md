summary: |
  The bill aims to amend Missouri's Constitution to affirm that citizens have an unalienable right to keep and carry firearms, including accessories. It states that any restrictions on these rights must be carefully reviewed and that the state must protect against infringing them. The bill also clarifies that cities and counties, like Kansas City and St. Louis, can create their own rules about owning and carrying guns through local ordinances, including permits and penalties, but these must follow certain guidelines and exceptions for law enforcement, military, and judges. This change affects gun owners, local governments, law enforcement, and others involved in firearm regulation or enforcement.
