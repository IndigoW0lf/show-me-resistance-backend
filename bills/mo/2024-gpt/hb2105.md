summary: |
  This bill requires school districts in Missouri to provide detailed information about their school board members to local election authorities. This includes the board members' names, how long they will serve, and links to the pages explaining how to run for election. The election authorities will then report this information to the state's secretary of state and publish it online for the public to see, making it easier to find and understand who is on school boards. The bill also updates rules for how vacancies on school boards are filled and reported. It affects school districts, election officials, and residents who want transparency about their local school governance.
