summary: |
  This bill makes several changes to Missouri laws regarding child custody and support. It clarifies how courts can order support payments, considering the child's needs, the parents' resources, and custody arrangements. The bill also defines when a parent's child support obligation can end, such as when the child turns 18 or 21, gets married, or enlists in the military. Additionally, it allows support obligations to continue if the child is disabled and unable to support themselves. These changes aim to make child support laws clearer and fairer for families and children.
