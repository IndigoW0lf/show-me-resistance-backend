summary: |
  This bill, HB2315, gives Missouri residents a new tax benefit if they work more than 40 hours in a week. It lets workers subtract the extra pay they earn for overtime from their state income taxes, making them potentially pay less in taxes. The bill also updates how certain types of income, like federal refunds and interest on government bonds, are counted for state taxes. It affects anyone who works overtime and pays taxes in Missouri by providing a way to reduce their tax bill related to that extra income.
