summary: |
  This bill modifies the existing "Champion for Children" tax credit in Missouri. It allows people who donate to certain child-focused organizations, such as child advocacy centers, court-appointed support groups (CASA), and crisis care centers, to receive a tax credit. The amount of the credit increases over time—from 50% of the donation from 2013 to 2024 to up to 70% starting in 2025—and must be at least $50. The bill also raises the total amount of tax credits available each year, with a cap of $25 million per year starting in 2025. These changes aim to encourage more charitable donations to organizations that support children in need, affecting taxpayers, charitable organizations, and state revenue.
