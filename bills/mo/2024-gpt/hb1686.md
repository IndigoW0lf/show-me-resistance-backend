summary: |
  The Missouri Voter Fraud Protection Act establishes stricter rules to prevent illegal voting and false registrations. It clears up what actions are considered illegal, such as giving false information to register or voting more than once. The bill also makes voting registration automatic for most eligible residents when they apply for or update certain official documents, unless they choose not to be registered. These changes aim to strengthen election integrity and make voter registration more streamlined for Missouri residents.
