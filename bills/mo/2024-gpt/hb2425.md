summary: |
  This bill creates new rules for pharmacy benefits managers (PBMs), which are companies that manage prescription drug benefits for health plans. It makes sure PBMs cannot require people to pay more at the pharmacy than what their insurance plan or paying with cash would cost. Pharmacists and pharmacies will also be allowed to tell patients their drug costs and suggest cheaper alternatives without interference from PBMs. Additionally, PBMs cannot charge pharmacies or hold them responsible for hidden fees or reduce reimbursements unfairly after a certain time. The bill aims to make drug costs clearer and fairer for consumers, while requiring PBMs to disclose any conflicts of interest with health insurance companies. It does not apply to federal plans like Medicare or self-funded employer plans and will be enforced by the Department of Commerce and Insurance.
