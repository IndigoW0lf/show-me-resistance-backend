summary: |
  This bill aims to prevent minors from viewing harmful material online by requiring businesses that share such content to check the age of those trying to access it. If a website has a significant amount of harmful material, that business must verify that users are at least 18 years old before allowing access. The bill defines what counts as harmful material and sets rules for how age verification should be done. Anyone can report violations to the attorney general, helping enforce these protections and keep minors safer online.
