summary: |
  The bill aims to amend Missouri’s Constitution to clarify and update how money collected from highway users—such as vehicle taxes, fees, and fuel taxes—is allocated. It specifies that these funds will go into the state road fund, which is used exclusively for building, maintaining, and improving roads and bridges, paying off related bonds, and reimbursing local governments for road projects. The change affects drivers, vehicle owners, and state transportation agencies, ensuring that highway-related revenue is dedicated to transportation use and not diverted to other purposes. The proposal also outlines procedures for managing the fund to ensure enough money is available for bond payments and highway maintenance.
