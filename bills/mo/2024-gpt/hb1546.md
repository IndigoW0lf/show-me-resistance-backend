summary: |
  This bill changes the laws on towing abandoned vehicles and vessels from private property. It allows law enforcement and local authorities to tow property that has been unattended for more than 48 hours or is deemed a safety hazard. Property owners or tenants who are present can authorize towing if signs are posted, but only during certain conditions. The bill also provides protections for those involved in towing, limiting liability for damages unless caused by negligence. It aims to make roadside and private property vehicle removal clearer and safer for everyone involved.
