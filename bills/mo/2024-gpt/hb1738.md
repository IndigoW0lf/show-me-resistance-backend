summary: |
  This bill changes the laws about how taxpayers in Missouri can receive tax credits for donating money to educational assistance organizations. It allows eligible donors to get a full credit equal to their donation, up to 50% of their in-state tax liability, and these credits can be carried over for four years. The total amount of tax credits available each year is increased from $50 million to $75 million, with adjustments for inflation. The bill also introduces new rules for how the credits are distributed throughout the year, ensuring more efficient use of the available credits. These changes aim to encourage more donations to support educational programs and benefit families participating in school scholarship options.
