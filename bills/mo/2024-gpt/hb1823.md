summary: |
  This bill requires Missouri public high schools and charter schools to teach students about CPR and first aid, specifically including training on how to perform CPR and the Heimlich maneuver for choking emergencies. Starting from the 2017-18 school year through 2023-24, students will receive at least 30 minutes of instruction on these skills during high school. Beginning in the 2024-25 school year, students in grades 9 through 12 must receive at least 30 minutes of training each year in both CPR and first aid for choking. The goal is to ensure that all high school students learn life-saving skills before graduation, with the instruction based on recognized health guidelines. Schools can partner with local first responder organizations for hands-on practice, and teachers are not required to be certified trainers unless students seek certification. The Department of Elementary and Secondary Education will help implement these requirements through rules and guidelines.
