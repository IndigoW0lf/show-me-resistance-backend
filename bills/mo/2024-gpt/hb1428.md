summary: |
  HB1428 modifies the existing property tax credit, called the "circuit breaker," by raising the maximum limits and adjusting the income levels at which the credit begins to phase out. This change aims to help more eligible property owners, especially seniors and disabled individuals, reduce their property tax burden. The bill clarifies eligibility rules, including age, residency, disability status, and income, and enhances fairness by updating how rent is calculated for the credit. Overall, it makes the tax relief program more generous and easier to access for qualified Missourians.
