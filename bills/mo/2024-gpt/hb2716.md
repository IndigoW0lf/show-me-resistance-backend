summary_short: "This law requires election offices in Missouri to provide at least one accessible voting machine for blind or visually impaired voters at every election."

summary: |
  The bill mandates that in Missouri, any election office serving fewer than 350,000 residents must have at least one electronic voting machine that is accessible to voters who are blind or visually impaired for all types of elections. These accessible machines help ensure that visually impaired voters can vote independently and privately during statewide, general assembly, and local elections. Voters who are blind or visually impaired can choose to use the accessible machine or vote by other approved methods, such as absentee ballots with assistance. The state will cover the costs of maintaining and operating these machines. Overall, this law helps improve voting access and fairness for voters with visual disabilities.
