summary_short: "This bill requires political subdivisions to approve or deny property development permits within 60 days or automatically approve them, with rules for extending the process and explaining denials."
summary: |
  The bill sets a clear timeline for local government agencies (political subdivisions) to review and decide on permit requests for developing or improving property. If they do not make a decision within 60 days, the request automatically gets approved. If they approve the request, they cannot add extra requirements, but if they deny it, they must provide a written explanation. The timeline can be extended if approvals from state or federal agencies are needed or if the applicant requests more time. This law is designed to make development approvals quicker, more predictable, and transparent for property owners and developers.
