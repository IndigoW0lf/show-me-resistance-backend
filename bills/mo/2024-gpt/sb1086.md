summary_short: "This bill changes how personal property taxes are assessed and adjusted over time in Missouri."

summary: |
  The bill updates the rules for determining personal property taxes in Missouri. Starting January 1, 2025, it requires the assessment of personal property at a percentage of its true value each year, with the percentage decreasing gradually until 2073. The goal is to keep the revenue from personal property taxes aligned with the growth of real property tax revenue, ensuring a balanced tax system. It also ensures that all personal property is assessed at one-third of its value each year for certain taxes. These changes apply to all counties and cities in Missouri and include provisions for reimbursements if local governments lose revenue because of these adjustments.
