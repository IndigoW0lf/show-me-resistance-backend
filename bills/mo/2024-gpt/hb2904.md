summary: |
  This bill updates Missouri law to make voting more accessible. It lets a person use a driverâ€™s license that has been expired for up to 60 days when registering to vote. Previously, the license had to be valid at the time of registration. The bill also clarifies rules for voter identification at the polls, requiring certain forms of photo ID, and specifies that if someone registers with a different form of ID, their registration expires after six years. Overall, the bill aims to simplify voter registration and ensure more qualified voters can participate in elections.
