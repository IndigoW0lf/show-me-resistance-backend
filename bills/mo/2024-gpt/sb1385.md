summary: |
  This bill makes important changes to protect health care workers and improve safety in health care facilities. It states that employees or contractors do not have to physically engage with violent patients if they fear for their safety. The bill also limits the types of restraint training that facilities can require, especially restricting the use of holds that could risk patient death unless absolutely necessary. Additionally, it clarifies that health care workers are not liable if a violent patient escapes, as long as they acted in good faith and without gross negligence. Nurses can stop caring for a patient if they are assaulted, and there are new rules for handling individuals who may harm themselves but do not need emergency treatment. Facilities that violate these rules could lose their licenses. Overall, these changes aim to keep health care workers safer while ensuring proper procedures are followed.
