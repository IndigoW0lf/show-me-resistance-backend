summary: |
  The bill, HJR106, aims to add a new section to Missouri's Constitution that recognizes every person's right to make and carry out their own medical decisions. These decisions include choosing contraception, fertility treatments, pregnancy continuation, miscarriage care, and abortion. The amendment specifies that the government cannot burden or interfere with these rights unless it uses the least restrictive means based on widely accepted medical standards. It also addresses abortion, allowing bans after fetal viability unless a doctor believes it is necessary to save the pregnant person's life or health. This measure affects all Missouri residents by protecting their personal medical and reproductive choices from excessive government restrictions.
