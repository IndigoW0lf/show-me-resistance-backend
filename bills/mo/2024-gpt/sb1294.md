summary_short: "This bill creates a special parole option for older inmates who meet certain age and time served criteria in Missouri."
summary: |
  The bill allows older prisoners in Missouri who are over a certain age and have served specific lengths of their sentences to request early release, called geriatric parole. To qualify, inmates must be at least 55, 60, or 65 years old, depending on the length of time they have already served. The parole board will hold a hearing to decide whether to grant this early release, considering factors like health, behavior, and safety risks. If approved, the inmate will be released within two days and will have conditions to follow during their parole period, which can last up to two years. This law aims to provide a compassionate option for elderly inmates and ensure public safety by considering their health and maturity.
