summary_short: "This bill updates the rules for obtaining permits to build and operate solid waste disposal and processing facilities in Missouri."

summary: |
  This legislation changes the laws in Missouri about how solid waste disposal areas and processing facilities are approved and managed. It requires anyone wanting to build or operate such facilities to first get permits from the state Department of Natural Resources. The bill also introduces new steps for public involvement, including notifications and public meetings, especially for new disposal sites proposed after 1999. It aims to make the permitting process clearer, more transparent, and ensure communities are informed and involved in decisions about waste facilities that may affect their environment and safety.
