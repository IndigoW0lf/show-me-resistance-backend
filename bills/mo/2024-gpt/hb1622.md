summary_short: "This bill allows public utility companies in Missouri to invest in workforce training and development, and recover those costs through their rates until 2034."
summary: |
  The bill permits electric and gas utility companies in Missouri to spend money on training and educating workers, especially in skilled crafts and STEM fields, to support energy services in the state. These companies can treat these investments as a regulatory asset, meaning they can recover the costs by including them in their rate calculations. The bill sets a limit on how much they can recover, which is based on a small percentage of their total revenues for 2023, and these provisions are in place until the end of 2034. This helps ensure that utility companies can fund workforce development while maintaining transparency and cost control for consumers.
