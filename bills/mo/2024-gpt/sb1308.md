summary: |
  The bill designates a part of U.S. Highway 63 in Osage County, Missouri, as the "POW/MIA SSG Paul Hasenbeck Memorial Highway." This means signs will be put up along that stretch of road to honor Staff Sergeant Paul Hasenbeck, who was a prisoner of war or missing in action. The Missouri Department of Transportation will handle installing and maintaining these signs at their cost. This legislation affects drivers traveling on that highway and ensures recognition for a fallen or missing service member.
