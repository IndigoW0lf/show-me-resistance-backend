summary: |
  The bill, known as HJR87, aims to amend Missouri's Constitution to explicitly guarantee the right of residents to hunt and fish forever. It emphasizes that hunting and fishing support exercise, social and emotional well-being, jobs, and local economies. It also states that these rights can be limited for certain individuals, like violent offenders or those considered mentally unsafe, as determined by law. The measure affects all Missourians who enjoy hunting and fishing by protecting their ability to do so legally, while still allowing laws that restrict these activities in specific circumstances.
