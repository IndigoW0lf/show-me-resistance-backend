summary_short: "This bill sets rules about how the state invests its money, including restrictions on investments that prioritize social or environmental goals over financial returns."

summary: |
  This bill updates existing laws to establish new standards for how Missouri manages and invests its public funds. It requires the state treasurer to create and follow a clear investment policy that includes limits on how much money can be invested in any one type of investment. Importantly, the bill prohibits the state from investing funds in companies or funds that prioritize social, environmental, or other non-financial goals over making the best financial return. This means the state cannot invest in organizations whose decisions are driven by social objectives such as environmental responsibility or social justiceâ€”if those decisions are made at the expense of financial gains. The bill also mandates transparency, requiring the treasurer to share investment policies with key government officials each year.
