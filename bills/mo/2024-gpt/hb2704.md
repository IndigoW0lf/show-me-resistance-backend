summary: |
  The bill repeals and replaces a section of Missouri law that defines terms related to lawsuits over improper health care. It clarifies what constitutes serious injuries, such as loss of limbs or permanent brain damage, and explains different types of damages like economic and non-economic damages. The law applies to various health care providers and services, and it aims to make the rules clearer about how health care-related lawsuits are handled, including how damages are calculated and assigned. This affects patients, healthcare providers, and those involved in medical liability cases in Missouri.
