summary_short: "This law updates rules about refusing chemical tests after being pulled over or arrested."
summary: |
  This bill changes how police handle situations when someone is asked to take a chemical test, like a breathalyzer, after being stopped or arrested. It states that if a person refuses the test, evidence of that refusal can be used in court. The bill also requires officers to tell the person why they're asking for the test and inform them that refusing can lead to license suspension. Additionally, if someone wants to speak to an attorney before deciding, they get a 20-minute wait. These rules affect drivers and vessel operators who are stopped by law enforcement.
