summary_short: "This bill requires the Missouri General Assembly to approve any federal regulations that the state enforces, delaying such enforcement until approval is given."

summary: |
  The bill 1141 changes how Missouri enforces federal regulations. It states that no state agency or department can enforce a federal rule within Missouri unless the stateâ€™s General Assembly explicitly approves it. Starting from August 28, 2024, any new federal regulation cannot be enforced by the state until approved by the legislature. Additionally, rules already in place that relate to federal regulations after this date will be reviewed by a special committee, which will recommend whether to continue enforcement and seek approval from the General Assembly. This bill aims to give the state more control and oversight over federal regulations affecting Missouri residents and agencies.
