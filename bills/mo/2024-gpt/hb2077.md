  The bill changes rules about how counties in Missouri can increase sales taxes. It lets county governments put a question on the ballot, asking voters if they want to add a small extra sales tax (up to 0.5%) for specific local projects. This vote must be approved by the majority of voters before the tax can be collected. The law also sets limits on when counties can propose these taxes and how the revenue can be used, affecting local governments and taxpayers.
