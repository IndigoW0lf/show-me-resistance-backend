summary_short: "This bill limits public access to audio and video recordings showing the death of a law enforcement officer in the line of duty, with certain exceptions for family members and legal proceedings."
summary: |
  This law makes it generally illegal for the public to see or hear recordings that show the death of a police officer while they are working, in order to protect the privacy and dignity of the officer and their family. However, a family member such as a spouse, parent, sibling, or adult child can be allowed to view or hear such recordings under specific rules set by law enforcement. The bill also ensures that prosecutors and defense attorneys can access these recordings for legal cases. Overall, it balances transparency with respect for the families affected.
