summary: |
  This bill, SB1018, states that whenever the government or a local government agency needs to move internet or video service equipment—like cables, poles, or fiber optics—the government must reimburse the internet or TV companies for those relocation costs. This applies to providers that deliver high-speed internet or video services to homes and businesses. The goal is to ensure that these companies are not financially burdened when infrastructure needs to be moved for projects like road repairs or construction.
