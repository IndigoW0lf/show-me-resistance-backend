  This legislation changes the rules for obtaining a license to sell used motor vehicles and other related businesses in Missouri.

The bill also specifies how the location must be certified by law enforcement or authorized officials. Additionally, dealerships must display a visible sign with their business name and maintain a contact phone number and email.
