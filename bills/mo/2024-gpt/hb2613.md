summary_short: "This bill allows customers of electric companies to switch between different rate plans and get retroactive credits for past payments."
summary: |
  The bill gives customers the right to change their electricity rate plans if their utility offers multiple options, including time-of-use plans. When a customer switches to a new plan, they can be credited for any savings they could have made on previous payments over the past 90 days. Utility companies are also required to clearly show the cost of each rate plan on each bill. If a customer doesn't choose a plan, they will automatically be enrolled in the least expensive plan based on their last year of usage, unless they ask to switch to a different plan. This bill aims to give consumers more control and transparency over their electricity billing options.
