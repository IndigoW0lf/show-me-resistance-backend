summary: |
  This bill makes it easier for people with professional experience from outside Missouri to work temporarily in the state. If someone has at least three years of work in a profession or occupation from another state or the District of Columbia, they can apply for a one-time, nonrenewable two-year temporary license to practice in Missouri. To get this license, they must pass any required exams and meet other qualifications, but they cannot have had their license revoked or be under investigation. This helps skilled professionals move and work in Missouri more quickly, although it doesn't apply to certain occupations like electrical contractors or those with federal licensing requirements. After two years, individuals must obtain a full, permanent license if they want to continue practicing in Missouri.
