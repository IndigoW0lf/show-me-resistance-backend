summary: |
  This bill establishes the "Classical Education Grant Program," which provides funding to public school districts in Missouri that want to start or expand classical education programs. Classical education emphasizes teaching students skills like language and math, as well as knowledge in literature, history, philosophy, science, and ethics. School districts can apply for grants by submitting plans that show how they will implement and measure success of these programs. The goal is to support educational options that develop well-rounded students through a classical approach, benefiting students, educators, and communities.
