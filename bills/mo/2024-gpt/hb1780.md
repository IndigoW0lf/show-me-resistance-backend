  This bill abolishes the use of the death penalty in Missouri. Instead, it states that if a person is convicted of a crime that could previously have led to the death penalty, they must now be sentenced to life imprisonment without the chance of getting out early. The bill also revises how different crimes are classified and sentenced, making the punishments more uniform and focusing on life imprisonment for severe offenses. It affects crime and justice laws, as well as courts and law enforcement, by changing how serious crimes are punished.
