summary: |
  This bill makes it possible for big cities and fire protection districts in Missouri to raise money for fire services by asking voters for permission. They can impose property taxes, up to 25 cents per $100 of property value, but only if voters approve it through a ballot measure. They can also consider adding a sales tax of up to half a percent, which can be used to reduce property taxes. Voters will have the chance to approve or reject these taxes before they are collected.
