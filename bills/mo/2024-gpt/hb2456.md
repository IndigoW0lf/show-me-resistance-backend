summary: |
  This bill directs the Missouri Department of Elementary and Secondary Education to create a curriculum about Black history and Black literature for high schools. A special work group made up of educators, state officials, and Black history and literature organizations will develop standards and lesson plans. Starting with the 2025-26 school year, all students who have finished ninth grade will need to complete one course in Black history and one in Black literature before graduating high school. Schools can exempt transfer students if they provide proof of similar coursework. This aims to ensure students learn important aspects of Black history and literature as part of their education.
