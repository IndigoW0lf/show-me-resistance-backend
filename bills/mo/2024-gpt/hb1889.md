summary: |
  This bill requires all boaters born after January 1, 1984, to have a boating safety identification card when operating a vessel on Missouri lakes. The card must show they have completed an approved safety course, passed an equivalency exam, or hold a valid Coast Guard license. The fees collected from issuing these cards will go directly to the state's water patrol division to support boating safety initiatives. The bill also lists exceptions for certain boaters like licensed Coast Guard masters, some nonresidents, and military personnel, ensuring only qualifying individuals need the card. Overall, this aims to improve boating safety across the state and fund related safety efforts.
