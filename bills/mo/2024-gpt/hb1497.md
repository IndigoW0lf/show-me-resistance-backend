summary: |
  This bill changes the rules for Missouri's public higher education institutions. It clarifies that the governing boards of these institutions have the authority to award degrees by diploma, including various types of bachelor's, master's, and professional degrees. It also modifies the roles of state agencies involved in higher education, such as creating a new "Coordinating Board for Higher Education" to oversee higher education policy and administration. These changes mainly affect public colleges, universities, their governing boards, and state education officials by clarifying their powers related to degree conferral and reorganizing some administrative structures.
