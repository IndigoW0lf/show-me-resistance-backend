summary_short: "Any amount paid by an enrollee for medications without a generic substitute counts toward their out-of-pocket limits."
summary: |
  This bill requires that if you pay for medication without a generic alternative, that payment will be included in your total out-of-pocket expenses for your health insurance. It ensures that all your payments for these medications are factored into your maximum cost-sharing limits. The law also clarifies how this applies to high-deductible health plans with health savings accounts and allows other treatment strategies like step therapy. This change helps enrollees better track their healthcare costs and could lead to more transparent and manageable expenses.
