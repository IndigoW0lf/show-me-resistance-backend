summary_short: "This bill updates funding rules for early childhood education programs in Missouri, especially for children ages three and four who are eligible for free or reduced-price lunch."
summary: |
  The bill changes how Missouri counts young children in early childhood education programs for funding and attendance purposes. It allows children aged three and four who qualify for free or reduced-price lunch to be included in a schoolâ€™s average daily attendance count if they attend certain district-operated or contract-based programs. This helps more young children and their schools receive funding, especially in programs meeting state standards. The bill also details how districts can fill enrollment spots if children leave and establishes funding payments starting in the 2024-25 school year based on attendance of these eligible children. Overall, it aims to support early childhood education and improve funding for programs serving low-income preschoolers.
