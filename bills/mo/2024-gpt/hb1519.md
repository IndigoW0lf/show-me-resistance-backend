summary: |
  This bill ensures that healthcare workers and institutions in Missouri can refuse to participate in medical procedures related to sex reassignment or gender identity transitioning if it conflicts with their moral, ethical, or religious beliefs. It also prohibits denying services, employment, or public benefits to individuals or organizations because they refuse to be involved in such treatments. The law aims to protect both healthcare providers and patients' rights, allowing personal and institutional beliefs to remain respected without facing discrimination or legal consequences.
