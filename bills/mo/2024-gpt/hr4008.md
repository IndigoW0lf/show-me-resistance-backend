summary: |
  This bill officially grants permission for the Association of Missouri Electric Cooperatives to use the House of Representatives chamber on July 18, 2024, from 2:00 p.m. to 4:00 p.m. so they can hold a mock legislative session as part of an educational event for young people. The event aims to teach youth about state government by letting them participate in simulated legislative hearings and discussions on current bills. A designated representative will oversee the groupâ€™s conduct, ensuring they act respectfully and maintain the decorum of the House during the event. The participants are not allowed to bring food, drinks, or smoking into the chamber, and they cannot access certain areas or use equipment or decorations within the chamber. This legislation preserves the tradition of using the House chamber for educational purposes and involves the community in civic learning.
