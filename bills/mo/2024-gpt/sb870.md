summary_short: "This bill sets up a process for Missouri to declare federal actions unconstitutional and refuse to enforce them within the state."
summary: |
  This bill authorizes Missouri to review federal laws, orders, or policies to determine if they go beyond the powers granted to the federal government by the U.S. Constitution. If the state finds a federal action unconstitutional, it can declare that action null and void within Missouri. It also establishes that state officials, agencies, and funds should not help enforce or support such unconstitutional federal actions. The bill gives the Missouri legislature the power to decide punishment or penalties for anyone attempting to enforce these federal actions that the state deems invalid. This law mainly affects federal government activities and how Missouri responds to federal actions seen as exceeding constitutional authority.
