summary: |
  The bill creates the "Uniform Real Property Electronic Recording Act," enabling the electronic submitting, signing, and storing of property-related documents. It updates existing laws to recognize electronic documents and signatures as legal and valid for recording property transactions. This means that counties and recording offices can now accept and manage electronically filed documents, reducing paperwork and speeding up property record processes. The law applies to anyone involved in property transactions, including individuals, businesses, and government agencies, and aims to modernize land records management across Missouri.
