summary_short: "This law requires online dating sites to verify that users are at least 18 years old before allowing access."
summary: |
  This bill makes it mandatory for internet dating services to check the age of anyone trying to use their site. The goal is to prevent minors from accessing dating platforms by requiring age verification through government IDs or reliable data methods. If a dating site does not follow these rules, the attorney general can take legal action, and the site could face fines, damages, or other penalties. This law helps protect minors and makes online dating safer for everyone.
