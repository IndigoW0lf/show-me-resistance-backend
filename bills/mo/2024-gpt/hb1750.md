summary: |
  This bill changes the rules in Missouri about when and how utility companies and government projects can take private property through eminent domain. It specifies the types of companies involved, such as those building roads, power plants, pipelines, or communication lines, and explains the legal process for them to acquire land when the owners can't agree on compensation. The bill also details how companies must describe the property they want to take and manages the process for determining damages. It affects landowners, including those in conservatorship or with lesser estate interests, by clarifying the procedures for property acquisition and compensation.
