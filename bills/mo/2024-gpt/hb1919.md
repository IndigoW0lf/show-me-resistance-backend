summary_short: "This bill encourages placing children with caregivers who share their or their parents' religious faith when possible."

summary: |
  The bill modifies the rules for placing children in foster care or other custody arrangements. It states that, whenever practical, child placement should be with a person, agency, or institution that shares the child's or the parents' religious faith. If the child's specific faith can't be identified, then the placement should align with the faith of one of the parents. The goal is to respect and consider religious compatibility during child placement, affecting courts, child welfare agencies, and families involved in foster care or custody decisions.
