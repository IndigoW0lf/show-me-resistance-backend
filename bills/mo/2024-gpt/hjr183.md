summary_short: "This bill proposes a constitutional change to limit local restrictions on property repairs and improvements in Missouri."

summary: |
  The bill aims to update Missouri's constitution to protect property owners from certain local restrictions on repairs and improvements. Specifically, it states that governments cannot require property owners to use specific materials or prevent them from making cost-effective repairs that donâ€™t negatively affect the property's appearance. However, a local government (like a city or county) can still block repairs or improvements if they reasonably believe the change will harm nearby property values or enjoyment. This change would give property owners more freedom to repair and upgrade their land while allowing local authorities to step in to protect neighboring properties if needed.
