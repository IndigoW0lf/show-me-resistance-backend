summary_short: "This bill removes the requirement for considering COVID-19 vaccination status in organ transplant procedures, except for lung transplants."

summary: |
  The bill repeals existing laws that required hospitals, doctors, and other organizations to consider a person's COVID-19 vaccination status when it comes to organ transplants, except when the organ being transplanted is a lung. This means that, for most types of organ transplants, vaccination status will no longer be a factor in decisions about referrals, evaluations, placement on waiting lists, or the suitability of donors. The change aims to remove vaccination status as a consideration in the transplant process, promoting fairness and focusing on medical criteria.
