summary: |
  The bill, HB2419, eliminates laws that prevented local governments from regulating the use of paper and plastic bags. It clarifies that merchants and vendors can choose whether to offer paper or plastic bags to customers and prevents local authorities from banning or taxing these bags. Additionally, it allows consumers to use reusable bags without restrictions. This change means consumers and businesses have more freedom to choose and use different types of bags when shopping, with less interference from local regulations.
