summary_short: "This law makes it illegal to secretly install or use electronic tracking devices on a vehicle without permission, with some exceptions."
summary: |
  This bill creates a new offense called "unlawful tracking of a motor vehicle" in Missouri. It makes it against the law for someone to knowingly put a GPS or other electronic tracking device on a vehicle without the consent of all owners, in order to monitor or follow the vehicle or its occupants. However, there are important exceptions: law enforcement acting lawfully, parents or guardians tracking minors they own, repossession agents, or companies managing rental or leased vehicles are not violating the law. The bill aims to protect vehicle owners and occupants from unauthorized tracking, while still allowing certain legitimate uses.
