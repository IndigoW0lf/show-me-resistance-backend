summary_short: "This bill changes rules about minimum prison sentences for certain felony offenders in Missouri."
summary: |
  This bill updates the laws on how long certain felony offenders must serve in prison before being eligible for release. It specifically applies to offenders with previous prison commitments for felonies, adjusting the minimum amount of their sentences they are required to complete. The new rules set different minimum prison terms based on whether the offender has one, two, or three or more prior prison commitments. This change aims to provide clearer guidelines on prison time, but it does not affect the governor's powers or existing provisions related to probation. The bill affects people convicted of specific felonies and is designed to influence sentencing and incarceration duration.
