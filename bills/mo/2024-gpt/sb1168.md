summary_short: "This bill limits public funding and government involvement in abortion services in Missouri and clarifies healthcare program rules."

summary: |
  This bill changes laws about healthcare and public funding in Missouri. It states that federal laws cannot force the state to fund or support abortions, and it supports encouraging childbirth over abortion using public money. The bill also makes it illegal for public funds to be used at abortion clinics or their affiliates. Additionally, it defines rules for Missouriâ€™s Medicaid program (MO HealthNet), explaining how payments are made for hospital and healthcare services, and gives residents and officials more protections against federal actions related to abortion funding. The overall goal is to protect the state's sovereignty and moral beliefs while regulating public funds and healthcare provisions.
