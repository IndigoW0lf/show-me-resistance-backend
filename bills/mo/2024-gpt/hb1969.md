summary_short: "This bill gives legal protections to employers who hire ex-offenders, making it harder to sue them for negligent hiring unless the employee has certain serious criminal convictions."
summary: |
  This legislation, called the "Civil Liability for Employers Hiring Ex-Offenders Act," aims to protect employers from legal action if they hire someone with a criminal record. Specifically, it limits lawsuits based on negligent hiring unless the employee has been convicted of serious or violent offenses listed in the law. If an employee has a nonviolent or nonsexual conviction that isn't related to their job, it generally can't be used as evidence against the employer. The law also clarifies that existing lawsuits about workplace safety or supervision are still valid unless the employer knew about or was grossly negligent regarding a relevant criminal conviction. This bill mainly affects employers, contractors, and property owners, reducing the risk of liability when hiring ex-offenders, except in cases involving serious crimes or misuse of funds.
