summary: |
  This bill, called the "Uniform Civil Remedies for Unauthorized Disclosure of Intimate Images Act," sets rules about sharing private images. If someone shares an intimate image of another person without their permission, and that image was private and identifiable, the person who shared it could be held legally responsible. It also explains what counts as an intimate image and what rights individuals have if their images are shared without consent. The goal is to give victims a way to seek justice and prevent the harmful sharing of private, intimate pictures.
