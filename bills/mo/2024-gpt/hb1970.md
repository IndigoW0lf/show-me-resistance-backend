summary_short: "This bill protects transportation network companies (like ride-sharing services) from being held legally responsible for accidents caused by their drivers, as long as the company follows the law and isn't negligent."
summary: |
  The bill states that transportation network companies (TNCs), such as ride-sharing companies, cannot be legally liable for harm caused by their drivers while using the digital network, unless the company was negligent or committed a crime. It means that if a driver causes an accident while logged into the app, the company generally won't be responsible for that harm, provided they followed all legal requirements and did not act negligently. This change affects how liability is determined in cases involving TNC drivers and aims to limit legal exposure for these companies.
