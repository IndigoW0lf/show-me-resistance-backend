summary_short: "Starts in 2025, solar energy property built before 2024 will have a simplified and limited property tax assessment."
summary: |
  This bill changes how the value of solar energy properties is assessed for property taxes in Missouri. Starting January 1, 2025, most solar projects built before the end of 2024 will be considered to have minimal value for tax purposes, and their assessed value will be carefully determined based on available documentation. Additionally, the amount of property tax owed on these solar projects will be capped at $1,000 per megawatt of power and includes any land reclassified due to the solar project. The bill also clarifies that existing agreements for tax incentives and financing will not be affected and that property taxes wonâ€™t be owed for parts of these properties that were previously exempted from taxes. This impacts solar project owners, local tax assessors, and government agencies involved in tax policies for renewable energy.
