summary_short: "This bill proposes changes to Missouri's Constitution to improve how the state creates and manages its budget, including requirements for the governor to submit a detailed budget and provisions for controlling expenditures based on actual revenue."
summary: |
  This bill aims to update Missouri's rules for creating the state budget by requiring the governor to submit a detailed, itemized budget within 30 days after each regular legislative session begins. It emphasizes that the budget should not include projected new revenues from legislation not yet passed. The bill also gives the governor more authority to control spending by adjusting expenditures if actual revenues are less than expected, but it stops this control for debt payments. These changes help make state budgeting more transparent and responsive to actual financial conditions, affecting the governor, the legislature, state agencies, and taxpayers by promoting responsible financial planning and accountability.
