summary_short: "This bill changes how property tax credits are given to certain seniors in Missouri."
summary: |
  This bill allows counties in Missouri to give property tax credits to senior homeowners who are 62 or older. The credit can reduce the amount they owe on their primary residence's property taxes. Counties can choose to offer this benefit either through a local law or by holding a vote. It helps seniors by potentially lowering their property tax bills if they meet specific criteria, like owning and living in their home and not owing any back taxes.
