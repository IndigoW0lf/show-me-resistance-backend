summary: |
  This bill changes the eligibility requirements for running for public office in Missouri. It states that anyone who has been convicted of a felony or pleads guilty to a felony cannot qualify as a candidate. Additionally, candidates must have all their state and local taxes paid up-to-date; if they owe taxes or are a corporate officer of a fee office with unpaid taxes, they could be disqualified. Candidates seeking certain office positions will need to file an affidavit confirming they have no outstanding tax debts. If a candidate is found to owe taxes after filing, they will have a limited time to pay, or they will be disqualified from running in that election. The bill aims to promote transparency and fiscal responsibility among candidates and affects all who wish to run for public office in Missouri.
