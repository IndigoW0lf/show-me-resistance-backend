summary: |
  The bill, HB1921, sets up a new fee that electric and plug-in hybrid vehicle owners will pay when registering their vehicles in Missouri starting January 1, 2025. The fee is a percentage of the vehicle’s price or value, depending on whether the vehicle is new or used. The money collected from these fees will go into the state’s road fund, supporting road maintenance and improvements. This change means owners of electric and hybrid vehicles will contribute to road funding, similar to traditional gas-powered vehicle owners.
