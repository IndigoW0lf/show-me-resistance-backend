summary: |
  This bill, SB804, mandates the Missouri Department of Elementary and Secondary Education to create and publish an annual report card for every public school, district, and charter school in the state. The report card will include important information such as school performance ratings, student attendance, graduation and dropout rates, suspension and expulsion data, staff qualifications, student achievement scores, financial details, and more. The goal is to make this information transparent and easily accessible for parents, taxpayers, school staff, policymakers, and the media. It also identifies schools that need improvement and ensures data reporting respects student privacy. All schools are required to share these reports by December 1 each year.
