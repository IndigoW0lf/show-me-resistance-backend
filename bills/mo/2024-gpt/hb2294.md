summary_short: "This bill prevents employers from firing, refusing to hire, or promoting employees based on their COVID-19 vaccination status and allows injured employees to sue employers who violate this rule."

summary: |
  This law makes it illegal for employers in Missouri to discriminate against workers or job applicants because they haven't received or shown proof of receiving a COVID-19 vaccine. Employers can't use a person's vaccination status as a reason to refuse to hire them, fire them, or deny them a promotion. If an employer does this, the affected employee can take legal action and potentially win damages and other relief in court. This law aims to protect employees from vaccination-related discrimination and ensures they have the right to seek justice if they are unfairly treated because of their vaccination choices or status.
