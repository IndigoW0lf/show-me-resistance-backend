summary_short: "This bill updates the laws about child safety seats and seat belts to better protect children in vehicles."

summary: |
  This bill changes Missouri's laws about how children must be secured in cars. It specifies that children under two years old must be in a rear-facing car seat, and children under four years old must be in an appropriate safety seat. Kids who weigh less than forty pounds or are under four years old need to use a proper child restraint system, while children over eight years old or taller than four feet nine inches should use a seat belt. The bill also allows children in the back seat to wear only a lap belt if the vehicle doesn't have a shoulder belt. These rules help ensure children are safely protected when traveling in a vehicle and apply to drivers of any age transporting kids under sixteen.
