summary_short: "This bill allows children to be excused from school attendance due to mental or behavioral health issues with proper documentation."

summary: |
  This bill updates Missouri's school attendance laws to include an option for children to be excused from attending school if they are experiencing mental or behavioral health concerns. To do so, a parent, guardian, or responsible person must provide a note from a licensed mental health professional stating that the child cannot attend school because of these health issues. The bill applies to children between the ages of five and the local compulsory attendance age, and it aims to support students' mental health needs while ensuring they are not unfairly penalized for these health concerns. It also clarifies existing rules about attendance and exemptions for different age groups and situations.
