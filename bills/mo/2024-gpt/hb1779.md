summary: |
  The bill updates the rules for distributing state funds to regional planning commissions in Missouri. It requires the funds to be matched by local funds, meaning the state will match half of what local areas contribute. The bill also caps the amount of state funding that can go to specific regional commissions—up to $130,000 for some and $50,000 for others—and adjusts these maximum amounts annually based on the consumer price index starting in 2026. This affects regional planning groups across Missouri that rely on state and local funds for their projects and planning efforts.
