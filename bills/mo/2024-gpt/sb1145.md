summary_short: "This bill updates Missouri laws on how custody of in vitro human embryos is handled, including legal definitions and court considerations."
summary: |
  The bill revises existing laws in Missouri regarding the custody of in vitro human embryos—those created outside a woman’s body. It clarifies legal terms such as custody types, embryos, and surrogates, and establishes that courts will decide custody based on the child's best interests. The law introduces a presumption that equal parenting time is usually best for the child, but this can be challenged if there is evidence of domestic violence or other factors. These changes affect families involved in reproductive arrangements, surrogacy, and custody disputes.
