summary: |
  This bill modifies Missouri's tax laws related to pensions and retirement income. It clarifies how much pension income is taxable and introduces new deductions for taxpayers receiving retirement benefits. For example, it allows certain retirement benefits to be subtracted from taxable income, reducing the amount of tax owed. These changes mainly affect individuals with private pensions and retirement accounts, helping lower-income retirees pay less in taxes on their retirement income.
