summary: |
  This bill makes changes to the laws about vehicle registration and license plates in Missouri. It clarifies that when someone sells a vehicle, the old license plates generally can't be kept or transferred except in specific cases. The bill also sets rules about how long temporary plates are valid if a vehicle is being sold or transferred. Additionally, it allows owners to transfer license plates from one vehicle to another of similar size or weight, for a small fee, and helps ensure proper registration when buying or selling vehicles. These updates affect vehicle owners, dealers, and the Department of Revenue responsible for vehicle registration.
