summary_short: "This bill requires insurance plans in Missouri to cover maternity services provided by midwives and creates a registry to reimburse doulas."
summary: |
  This bill changes Missouri law to ensure that health insurance plans issued or renewed after January 1, 2025, cover maternity care by midwives, including certified nurse midwives and professional midwives, without extra costs for patients. It makes sure that services from midwives are treated the same as those from doctors and that patients get reimbursed for these services. The bill also establishes a process for registering and reimbursing doulas—support persons for pregnant women—so their services can be covered by insurance. This affects women receiving maternity care, midwives, and doulas by expanding and equalizing coverage for their services.
