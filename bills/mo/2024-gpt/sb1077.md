summary: |
  This bill prevents Missouri state departments and agencies from working with companies or local governments that help employees pay for or access abortions. It specifically prohibits contracts, grants, tax benefits, or access to government programs if the company provides assistance like transportation, lodging, food, or reimbursements related to abortion, unless required by federal law. If a company or local government does provide such assistance after making a contract, their contract must be immediately ended, and they must return any funds received. The bill also sets rules for when the state can do business with a company that has previously offered abortion-related assistance, requiring a wait period of at least one year. The attorney general can enforce these rules through legal action. This legislation mainly affects companies working with the government and their employees' access to abortion-related support.
