summary_short: "This bill creates a process for automatically expunging certain criminal records in Missouri after specific waiting periods."

summary: |
  This legislation establishes a new system for clearing criminal records, called expungement, for many types of offenses in Missouri. Starting August 28, 2027, eligible individuals can have their records automatically closed and made inaccessible to the public after they have completed their sentences and waited the required time—such as one, three, or five years—depending on the type of offense. This applies to minor violations like infractions, misdemeanors, and some felony cases, especially if the person has not committed any new crimes during the waiting period. The law aims to give people a fresh start by making their criminal history less visible, which can help them find employment or housing. It mainly affects those who have completed their sentences and meet the specified criteria for expungement.
