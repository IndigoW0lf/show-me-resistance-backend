summary_short: "This bill sets up a system for health insurance to reimburse for doula services in Missouri."  
summary: |
  The bill creates a program allowing certain doulas—individuals who provide support and education to pregnant women— to be registered and approved for health insurance reimbursement. The Department of Health and Senior Services will develop criteria, review applications, and maintain a statewide list of registered doulas who meet these standards. While anyone can practice as a doula regardless of registration, this measure aims to support access to community-based doula services and improve maternal care by helping cover costs through insurance.
