summary: |
  This bill makes changes to the regulations governing mutual insurance companies in Missouri. It establishes clear rules about the types of reinsurance these companies can use, emphasizing that they are not required to hold more reinsurance than what is considered adequate based on a catastrophe model. The bill also states that the Missouri Department of Insurance's authority over these companies is limited to what is specifically outlined in the law, and previous agreements giving the department extra control are now void. Additionally, the bill relaxes rules around mergers, limiting when the Department of Insurance can hold hearings, requiring only substantial evidence that a merger could harm policyholders. Overall, it aims to protect mutual insurers and ensure transparent regulation.
