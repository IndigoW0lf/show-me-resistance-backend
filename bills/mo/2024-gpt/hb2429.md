summary: |
  This bill changes the laws about how school attendance is enforced in Missouri. It states that parents or guardians who do not make sure their children attend school can be fined or face a minor legal penalty. If someone is found guilty, they must enroll the child in a school within three days, and every day the child is not in school counts as a violation. The law also allows for penalties to be suspended if the child starts attending school regularly, and proof of attendance from the school can be used as evidence. This affects parents, guardians, and families, and aims to encourage consistent school attendance.
