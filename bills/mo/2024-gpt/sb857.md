summary: |
  This bill establishes the Elementary Literacy Fund, which provides grants to local schools and educational organizations to support reading programs at home for children in kindergarten through fifth grade. The program focuses on mailing students books they can read themselves and engaging parents through regular communication in multiple languages. Schools or organizations applying for the grants must match any funds received and follow specific guidelines for the program, such as including student book choices, building literacy skills, collecting data, and reporting progress. The goal is to improve reading skills among elementary students and increase parental involvement in literacy efforts.
