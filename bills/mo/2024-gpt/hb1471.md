summary_short: "This bill aims to make Missouri permanently stop observing daylight saving time and instead keep standard time year-round, unless the federal government changes the rules."
summary: |
  This bill proposes that Missouri will stop changing clocks for daylight saving time and will stay on standard time all year long. The state will have its last switch to daylight saving time, and from then on, daylight saving time will no longer be observed in Missouri. However, if the federal government later decides to make daylight saving time the new standard nationally, Missouri will follow that change and adopt it. This bill affects all residents and businesses in Missouri by changing how clock time is handled across the state.
