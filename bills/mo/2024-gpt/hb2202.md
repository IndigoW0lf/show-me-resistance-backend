summary_short: "This bill allows people in prison to raise a claim of actual innocence in post-conviction cases if they believe the original court's findings were wrong."

summary: |
  This bill allows individuals who are currently in prison or under state supervision to formally claim they are actually innocent of the crimes they were convicted of. If they believe the original court made a mistake, they can submit new evidence that wasnâ€™t considered before. The court can review this new evidence and, if it clearly proves innocence, can overturn or set aside the original conviction. This change impacts incarcerated people and aims to improve fairness in the justice system by providing a clearer process for correcting wrongful convictions.
