summary_short: "This bill changes the required number of signatures needed to put an initiative on the Missouri ballot."
summary: |
  The bill proposes amending Missouri's rules for voter petitions to change how many signatures are needed. For constitutional changes, it requires signatures from 8% of voters in each of two-thirds of the congressional districts. For laws, it requires signatures from 5% of voters in at least two-thirds of the districts. Also, petitions must be filed at least six months before an election and include the full text of the proposed measure. These new rules affect citizens who want to propose amendments to the state constitution or laws through initiatives.
