  The bill establishes a "Media Literacy and Critical Thinking" pilot program in Missouri, where the Department of Elementary and Secondary Education will choose 5 to 7 school districts to participate. These districts will focus on teaching students how to access, analyze, evaluate, and participate with various types of media, including news and social media content.
