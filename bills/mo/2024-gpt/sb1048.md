summary: |
  The bill improves the authority of the Missouri State Auditor by allowing them to audit more government agencies and political subdivisions when there's suspicion of misconduct, fraud, mismanagement, or law violations. It explicitly states that the auditor can review financial records, property, equipment, and even tax returns related to official business. The bill also requires contracts resulting from grants to include clauses that give the auditor access to necessary information. These changes help ensure government transparency and accountability by giving the auditor clearer and broader powers to detect and investigate improper activities.
