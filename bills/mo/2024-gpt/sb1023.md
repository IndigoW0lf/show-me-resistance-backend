summary: |
  The bill updates the law to let the circuit court of St. Louis City charge civil case filing fees of up to $20, instead of the current maximum of $15. This fee helps cover costs such as maintaining a law library and other court-related expenses. The change applies specifically to the St. Louis City circuit court and some other courts in Missouri. It does not affect cases where costs are waived or paid by the government. This helps courts collect additional funds to support their operations, but also impacts individuals and businesses filing civil cases in those courts.
