summary_short: "This bill changes the number of signatures needed for initiative petitions to qualify for the ballot in Missouri."
summary: |
  The bill proposes an amendment to the Missouri Constitution that adjusts the signature requirements for citizen-initiated measures. Specifically, it reduces the needed signatures for constitutional amendments from eight percent to five percent of voters in each of two-thirds of the congressional districts. For laws, the signature requirement is lowered from five percent to three and three-fifths percent. It also details how petitions should be filed and what they must contain. This change aims to make it easier for citizens to put initiatives on the ballot and affects anyone involved in shaping laws or constitutional amendments through citizen petitions.
