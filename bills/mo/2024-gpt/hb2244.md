summary: |
  This bill introduces a new voting method called ranked-choice voting for primary and general elections in Missouri. Instead of voting for just one candidate, voters will rank candidates by preference on their ballots. If no candidate receives more than half the votes initially, the candidate with the fewest votes will be eliminated, and votes for that candidate will be redistributed to votersâ€™ next choices. This process continues until a candidate has a majority and is declared the winner. The change affects all voters, candidates, and election officials in Missouri, making elections more about broader voter preferences and reducing the chance of vote splitting.
