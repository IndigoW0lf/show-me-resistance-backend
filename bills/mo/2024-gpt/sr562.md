summary: |
  The bill modifies Senate Rule 50 to change how many bills committee chairs can report during certain times. It states that each committee chair can report up to three bills at once when the Senate is working on reports from multiple committees. The Senate president pro tempore can allow the reporting of more than three bills at their discretion. Additionally, it ensures that bills recommended for approval are reported to the Senate with all amendments printed, and it clarifies procedures for relaying bills between committees and the Senate. These rules affect senators, committee chairs, and anyone involved in the legislative process by establishing clearer limits and procedures for handling bills in the Senate.
