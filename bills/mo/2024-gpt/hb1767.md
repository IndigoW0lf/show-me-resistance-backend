summary: |
  The bill adjusts the timeframe during which trade-in allowances and rebates on vehicles, boats, trailers, and outboard motors can be used to reduce sales tax. Specifically, it allows buyers to credit the value of a trade-in or rebate against the purchase price if certain records are provided, and it extends the period for when these allowances can be applied—up to 180 days for most people, or one year for seniors—relative to the date of the new purchase. This change makes it easier for consumers to get a fair credit for their trade-in or rebate when buying a new vehicle or boat in Missouri. It also clarifies how the tax is calculated based on the actual trade-in value and rebate received.
