summary: |
  This legislation revises Missouriâ€™s child passenger safety laws by replacing an older law with clearer, updated requirements. It states that children under two must be in a rear-facing car seat, and children under four must be in an approved child safety seat. For children between ages four and eight who are at least 40 pounds and under 4'9" tall, a booster seat or appropriate restraint is required. The law also clarifies rules for children over eight or over 80 pounds, who should wear a seat belt, and allows some exceptions for transporting multiple children when seats are limited. These changes aim to make child passenger safety laws clearer and more specific to better protect children in vehicles.
