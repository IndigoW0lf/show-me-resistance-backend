summary_short: "This bill limits the use of the design-build method to only certain state and local government entities starting August 28, 2024."

summary: |
  The bill changes the rules around how government projects, like building or remodeling structures, can be contracted. Specifically, it restricts the use of the design-build method—an approach where one team handles both the design and construction—so that only local and state government entities can require this process in their projects. This means that most other organizations, such as public universities or other entities, will no longer be able to mandate the design-build approach for their building projects starting from August 28, 2024. The goal is to clarify who is allowed to use this method and ensure only certain government bodies can require it.
