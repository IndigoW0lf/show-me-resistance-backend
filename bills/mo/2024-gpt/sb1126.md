summary: |
  This bill sets a new minimum wage for workers in Missouri, raising it gradually until it reaches $15 per hour in 2026. Starting from 2019, the wage will increase each year until 2023, reaching $12, and then continue to rise until it hits $15 in 2026. The wage will also adjust annually based on changes in the cost of living, ensuring it keeps pace with inflation. Public employers, like government agencies and schools, are excluded from certain parts of these wage increases. This change impacts most private sector employees and helps promote fair pay across the state.
