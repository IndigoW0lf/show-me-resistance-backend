summary_short: "This bill updates rules for how advanced practice registered nurses can work with doctors to provide medicines and treatments."
summary: |
  The bill changes the laws in Missouri to allow advanced practice registered nurses (APRNs) to work more independently with doctors through written agreements called collaborative practice arrangements. These agreements let APRNs prescribe, dispense, or administer certain medications, including some controlled substances like opioids, under specific conditions. The law also clarifies that APRNs can prescribe medication-assisted treatments for substance use disorders and provides guidelines for agreements regarding hospice care. Overall, it aims to expand the roles of qualified nurses in providing patient care while ensuring safety and proper oversight.
