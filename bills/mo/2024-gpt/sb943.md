summary: |
  This bill changes the rules about prescribing opioids in Missouri. It generally limits initial prescriptions for acute pain to a seven-day supply, but doctors can provide more if they explain why and document it. The bill also states that pharmacists cannot be punished for refusing to fill prescriptions that go beyond these limits if they are valid. Prescriptions for Schedule II drugs are limited to a 30-day supply, and for Schedule III, IV, or V drugs, up to 90 days, with the possibility of increasing the supply with doctor approval. These rules aim to reduce the risk of opioid misuse while allowing doctors to treat patients properly in specific situations.
