summary: |
  This bill makes changes to existing laws related to business transactions in Missouri. It specifically repeals many previous legal sections and replaces them with new provisions. One important new rule is that government agencies and public organizations are not allowed to accept payments made with central bank digital currency (a type of digital money issued by the government). These updates help clarify what forms of payment are accepted and ensure transparency in government financial dealings.
