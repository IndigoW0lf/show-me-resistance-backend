summary_short: "This bill proposes changes to how property taxes are assessed in Missouri, including rules for assessing residential property and protections for homeowners from increased property values."
summary: |
  This bill aims to update Missouri's rules for assessing property taxes. Starting in 2025, it limits how much the value of many residential properties can increase for tax purposes, especially for primary homes and certain senior taxpayers. Instead of reassessing property at its full market value each year, the new rules keep assessed values more stable, only raising them by the rate of inflation or up to 2% annually. This helps homeowners avoid sudden large increases in property taxes. The bill also changes how different classes and subclasses of property are valued for taxation, aiming for fairer assessments across different types of properties.
