summary: |
  This legislation exempts the retail sale of food from state sales and use tax beginning January 1, 2025. Prior to that date, there was a 1% tax on groceries, which funds schools. The bill defines "food" as items that can be bought with SNAP benefits, including vending machine sales, but excludes prepared foods sold by restaurants and similar businesses that make most of their revenue from ready-to-eat meals. This change will help reduce the cost of food for consumers and mainly affects shoppers and grocery stores in Missouri.
