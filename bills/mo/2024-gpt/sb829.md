summary: |
  This bill updates Missouri's rules around renewable natural gas (RNG), a cleaner energy source made from biogas or hydrogen, which can be used in pipelines or as fuel. It allows gas companies to voluntarily develop a program to produce, process, and deliver RNG to customers. The bill sets rules for how these companies can report their activities, submit plans, and recover costs from the public once their RNG projects are operational. It is designed to promote the use of renewable energy while protecting consumers and ensuring proper oversight.
