summary: |
  This bill focuses on improving teacher recruitment and retention by increasing minimum teacher salaries over time, with specific increases for teachers with advanced degrees and experience. It sets new salary levels to ensure teachers are paid fairly as costs of living rise. Additionally, the bill creates two new programs: the Teacher Baseline Salary Grant Program and the Teacher Recruitment and Retention State Scholarship Program, designed to support schools and attract more individuals into the teaching profession. These changes will impact public school teachers, school districts, and future education staff by providing better pay and support for teaching careers.
