summary: |
  This bill, HB 2356, changes how property taxes are paid in Missouri. It gives county governments the authority to let residents pay their real and personal property taxes in smaller payments throughout the year, such as annually, semiannually, or quarterly. The counties will estimate the total tax bill based on the previous year and divide it across the scheduled payments. If taxpayers pay more than they owe, the county will refund the excess at the end of the year. The bill also states that if a taxpayer misses an installment, the county can charge interest on the unpaid amount. Financial institutions that handle escrow accounts for property taxes are not affected by these new payment options. These changes aim to give taxpayers more flexibility while ensuring proper tax collection and refunds.
