summary: |
  This bill changes the rules for bathrooms and changing rooms in public schools. It requires schools to designate these facilities for one sex only, based on the student's official birth record. Students must use the facilities aligned with their biological sex as listed on their birth certificate unless temporary accommodations are made. The bill also clearly defines terms like "female," "male," "sex," and "bathroom" to specify the scope of these rules. It affects students, school districts, and charter schools by establishing strict guidelines on which facilities students can use, aiming to keep gender-segregated spaces based on biological sex.
