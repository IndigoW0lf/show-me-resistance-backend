summary_short: "This bill requires the Missouri Department of Elementary and Secondary Education to create and share detailed annual reports on school performance and student achievement for all public schools and districts."

summary: |
  The bill mandates that the Department of Elementary and Secondary Education in Missouri produce a yearly report card for every public school, district, and charter school. These report cards will include information about student performance, school demographics, staff experience, financial data, and more, making it easier for parents, taxpayers, educators, and the media to understand how schools are doing. The reports will also identify schools that need extra support, such as priority or improvement schools, while ensuring student and staff privacy. This new requirement aims to increase transparency and accountability across the state's public schools.
