summary: |
  This bill mandates the Missouri Department of Elementary and Secondary Education to create and share a detailed school report card each year for every public school, district, and charter school. These report cards will include information on student achievement, staff, finances, attendance, graduation rates, and other important data. The goal is to make school performance information clear and accessible for parents, taxpayers, educators, lawmakers, and the media. Schools identified as needing improvement will also be highlighted, and districts are encouraged to share this information widely by December 1st each year.
