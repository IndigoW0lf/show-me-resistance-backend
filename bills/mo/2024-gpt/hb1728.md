summary: |
  The bill changes existing laws about utilities in Missouri, specifically focusing on how utilities can finance certain costs through bonds and financial arrangements. It provides clear definitions for terms like "ancillary agreements," "assignees," and "energy transition costs." The bill also outlines what costs can be included when a utility retires or abandons a power plant, and how these costs are managed through securitized bonds. These changes will impact utility companies, regulators, and consumers by clarifying procedures for financing utility-related costs and costs associated with energy transitions.
