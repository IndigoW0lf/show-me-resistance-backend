summary_short: "This bill updates the rules for inspecting long-term care facilities in Missouri to improve oversight and ensure safety."
summary: |
  This bill changes the laws about how long-term care facilities, like nursing homes and assisted living centers, are inspected in Missouri. It requires the health department to review applications for new licenses, conduct inspections, and make sure facilities meet specific safety and quality standards. The bill also specifies when inspections should happen—at least once a year without warning—and gives the department more authority to inspect existing facilities and records to ensure compliance. These changes aim to improve the safety, quality, and accountability of long-term care facilities, affecting operators, administrators, and residents in these settings.
