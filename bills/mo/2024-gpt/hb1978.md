summary: |
  This bill makes it legal for organizations registered with the Missouri Department of Health and Senior Services to distribute hypodermic needles and syringes as part of a program to reduce health risks associated with unsafe drug injections. These organizations must have a partnership with mental health or substance use treatment providers. The bill also states that such registered groups cannot operate within 500 feet of a school built after the program started. Overall, the bill helps promote safer drug use practices and reduces legal barriers for organizations providing clean needles, potentially reducing the spread of disease and supporting public health.
