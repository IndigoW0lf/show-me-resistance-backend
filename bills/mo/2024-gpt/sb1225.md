summary: |
  This bill changes Missouri's income tax laws to provide higher or new tax deductions for people supporting dependents. It allows residents to subtract $1,200 for each dependent, with extra deductions for seniors over 65, single parents, and certain stillbirths or newborns. Starting in 2025, parents who have a baby can also claim an additional $2,400 deduction for that child, even if the federal exemption is zero. These changes aim to make it easier for families to reduce their taxes and support their children and elderly relatives.
