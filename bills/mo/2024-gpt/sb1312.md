summary_short: "This bill updates the laws about making threats related to danger or terrorism, clarifying what is illegal and the penalties involved."

summary: |
  The bill changes the existing laws in Missouri about making threats that could cause harm or panic. It makes it a crime to knowingly threaten, falsely report, or cause false beliefs about dangerous incidents that could lead to evacuations or harm to people. If someone commits this offense, they could face serious criminal penalties, with harsher punishments if someone is injured or property is damaged. The law also protects individuals acting in good faith to prevent harm, meaning they won't be punished if they are trying to help. This bill applies to anyone who might make such threats or false reports, aiming to improve public safety and clarify legal responsibilities.
