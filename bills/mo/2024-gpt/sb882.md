summary_short: "This bill changes start dates for public schools in districts with charter schools and sets rules for school calendars."
summary: |
  This bill updates Missouri's rules about when schools can start each year. It allows districts that have charter schools or operate year-round to set their own start dates more freely. For other districts, it requires that schools start no earlier than two weeks before September, unless they hold a public meeting and get approval. The bill also enforces penalties if districts start too early without following the rules, and provides exemptions for districts facing special circumstances.
