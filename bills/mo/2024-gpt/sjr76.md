summary: |
  The bill seeks to amend the Missouri Constitution to require most MO HealthNet (Medicaid) recipients aged 18 to 49 to meet monthly work or community activity requirements in order to continue receiving benefits. Participants will need to complete at least 80 hours of activities like employment, education, community service, job searching, or substance abuse treatment. The rules include exemptions for those who are medically frail, pregnant, caring for young children or dependent adults, or already meeting similar work requirements through other assistance programs like SNAP or TANF. The proposal is dependent on federal approval and aims to promote employment and community involvement among Medicaid recipients while providing protections for certain vulnerable groups.
