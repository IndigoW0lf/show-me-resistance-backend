summary: |
  The "Zero-Cost Adoption Fund Act" establishes a new fund that helps offset the costs associated with adoption. It also provides a tax credit to individuals, businesses, and organizations in Missouri who make qualifying donations to this fund. Those who contribute can receive a tax reduction of up to 100% of their contribution, with a limit of 50% of their total state tax liability, and can carry over unused credits for up to four years. The program will start in 2025, with an initial annual cap of $25 million in tax credits, which will increase with inflation until reaching $75 million. This bill affects taxpayers interested in supporting adoption, as well as organizations involved in the adoption process.
