summary_short: "This bill changes how personal property taxes are assessed in Missouri, including adjustments to the valuation percentages and assessment procedures."
summary: |
  This bill updates Missouri's rules for taxing personal property, which includes things like business equipment and other tangible items. Starting after 2024, the assessment rate drops from 33 1/3% to 31% of the property's true value, meaning property owners may pay different amounts of tax. The bill also specifies how real property and certain airport-related possessory interests should be valued, especially for properties within airport boundaries. It requires assessors to evaluate property values every two years and to submit assessment plans for approval, helping create a clearer and more consistent process for property taxes. These changes impact property owners, assessors, local governments, and taxpayers across the state.
