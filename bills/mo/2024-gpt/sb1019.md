  SB1019 makes changes to the rules about when government records and meetings can be kept secret. It allows public bodies to close certain records related to legal cases, real estate transactions, and employee matters, among others. However, many of these records must be made public once the legal matter is finished or certain conditions are met. The bill aims to balance transparency with privacy and legal protections, affecting government agencies, employees, and the public interested in government activities.
