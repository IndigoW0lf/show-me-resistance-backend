summary: |
  This bill, called SB823, changes the way Missouri taxes the income of corporations. Starting in 2020, the corporate income tax rate is 4%, and it will decrease to 3.75% in 2025. The bill also allows for additional reductions starting in 2026 if the state's revenue from corporate taxes exceeds certain levels, but no more than three reductions can occur. These changes aim to lower the tax burden on businesses in Missouri over time, depending on the state's revenue situation. The bill does not apply to out-of-state businesses operating in Missouri.
