summary: |
  This law establishes a new fund called the Education Stabilization Fund, which is stored in the state treasury and used to support public school funding in Missouri. The governor can transfer money into this fund when needed, especially during years when state revenues fall short of estimates. The fund helps ensure public schools receive proper funding, and any leftover money at the end of each fiscal year stays in the fund or is transferred to the state's general revenue, but the total amount kept in the fund is limited to 10% of the previous year's school funding. Overall, this law aims to stabilize funding for public education and manage state resources more effectively.
