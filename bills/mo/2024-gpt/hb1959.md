summary_short: "This law protects religious groups' right to hold services without interference from public officials, except in emergencies or if planning violence."

summary: |
  The Missouri Religious Freedom Protection Act prevents government officials from issuing orders that stop churches or religious groups from holding religious services or meetings. It ensures that, unless there is a clear emergency like natural disasters or safety threats, religious gatherings cannot be restricted by government actions. However, it does not prevent compliance with safety and building rules, and it allows restrictions during emergencies or if there is intent to cause harm. This law mainly impacts religious organizations, government officials, and the general public by safeguarding religious practices from unnecessary interference.
