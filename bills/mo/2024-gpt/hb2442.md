summary_short: "Allows metropolitan school districts in Missouri to ask voters for permission to impose a small property tax to fund special educational services."
summary: |
  This bill gives school districts in metropolitan areas the authority to collect a small property tax—up to 3 cents per hundred dollars of property value—specifically for funding special education programs. Before collecting this tax, the district must put the question to voters during a general election, asking for their approval. If most voters agree, the tax is imposed and revenue is placed into a dedicated trust fund to support special educational services. If voters do not approve, the district cannot collect the tax unless they ask again and obtain voter approval in a future election. The law clarifies how the tax is imposed, approved, and used, ensuring transparency and voter involvement.
