summary: |
  The bill modifies existing laws to set clear standards for how pet shops and other animal facilities must care for animals. It defines terms like adequate food, water, and housing to ensure animals are properly nourished, safe, and protected from harsh weather. The legislation also clarifies roles of different facilities, such as shelters, kennels, and breeders, and assigns oversight responsibilities to licensed veterinarians and officials. These changes aim to improve the treatment of animals in commercial and rescue settings and provide transparency and accountability for those operating such facilities.
