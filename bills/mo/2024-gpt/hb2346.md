  This bill officially sets the fourth Wednesday of February each year as "Hypertrophic Cardiomyopathy Awareness Day" in Missouri. It encourages people in the state to participate in events and activities that help raise awareness about hypertrophic cardiomyopathy, a hereditary heart condition that often goes undiagnosed. The condition causes the heart muscle to thicken and can lead to irregular heartbeats or sudden death. The bill aims to promote understanding and early detection of this serious health issue for residents and healthcare providers.
