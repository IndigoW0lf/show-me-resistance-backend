summary_short: "This bill proposes adding a new requirement for Missouri law enforcement and political subdivisions to ensure adequate police staffing and reporting."  
summary: |
  This bill aims to improve public safety in Missouri by requiring local governments to maintain enough police officers to protect residents. It also mandates that city police departments accurately report crime data to the state, and that the stateâ€™s public safety department develop plans to ensure cities deemed most dangerous have enough officers on duty. If local governments do not follow these rules, the state can seek legal action, and people who obstruct police enforcement could face fines, with those funds going to support families of fallen officers. All these changes affect local police agencies, city governments, and residents across Missouri.
