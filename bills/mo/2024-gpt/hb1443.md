summary_short: "This bill tightens laws against hazing by defining specific dangerous acts, establishing penalties, and requiring colleges to have anti-hazing policies."

summary: |
  This bill updates Missouri's laws on hazing to make them clearer and stronger. It states that anyone who participates in or causes acts that recklessly endanger a student’s safety or mental health—such as physical abuse, extreme stress, or illegal activities—could face criminal charges. Colleges and universities must create written policies to prevent hazing within their organizations. The law emphasizes that consent is not a defense for hazing and specifies penalties, including fines and jail time, depending on how serious the act is. It also provides protections for people who call for help during hazing incidents and encourages a focus on safety.
