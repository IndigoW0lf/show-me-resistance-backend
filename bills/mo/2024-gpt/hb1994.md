summary: |
  This bill establishes the Missouri Bureau of Investigation (MBI), a new division within the attorney generalâ€™s office. The MBI has the authority to investigate a wide range of crimes across the state, and its director is appointed by the attorney general with Senate approval. The bureau can be asked to investigate crimes by the attorney general or local law enforcement agencies like police, prosecutors, sheriffs, and highway patrol. It also sets rules for hiring agents, including background checks to exclude convicted felons, and requires officers to take an oath. When the bureau is requested to investigate crimes other than drug-related offenses, it must notify local authorities involved unless they are part of the case. Overall, this bill strengthens statewide criminal investigation capabilities and clarifies how investigations are initiated and managed.
