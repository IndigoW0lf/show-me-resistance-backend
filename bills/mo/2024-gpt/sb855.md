summary_short: "This bill updates Missouri's rules for people and organizations using renewable energy systems to generate their own power and sell excess back to the grid."

summary: |
  The bill, known as the "Net Metering and Easy Connection Act," changes Missouri laws to support people and businesses that install small renewable energy systems, like solar panels or wind turbines, on their property. It sets clear standards for how these systems can connect to the electric grid and how their energy use and generation will be measured. This allows customers to get credited for the electricity they produce and send back to the grid, making renewable energy more accessible and potentially lowering their electricity bills. The legislation mainly impacts individual homeowners, small businesses, electric utility companies, and regulatory agencies involved in energy management.
