summary_short: "This bill bans the use of restraints like handcuffs on children in juvenile court unless specific safety conditions are met."

summary: |
  This bill makes it illegal to use restraints such as handcuffs, chains, irons, or straitjackets on children during juvenile court proceedings. Restraints can only be used if the court finds that it is necessary to prevent physical harm, disruptive behavior that could cause harm, or the child fleeing the court, and only if there are no less restrictive options available. The bill also requires courts to give children a chance to speak before restraints are ordered and ensures children can move their hands enough to participate in their case. Overall, the bill aims to protect children's rights and safety during court visits.
