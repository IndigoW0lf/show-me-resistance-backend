summary_short: "This bill removes the expiration date for laws about small wireless facilities in Missouri, making them permanent."

summary: |
  The bill repeals a previous law that set an end date of January 1, 2025, for regulations related to small wireless facilities in Missouri. This means that rules allowing the installation and placement of small wireless equipment, like small cell towers, will now stay in effect permanently. The change impacts telecommunications companies, local governments, and residents by ensuring ongoing access to wireless infrastructure without the regulations automatically ending in 2025.
