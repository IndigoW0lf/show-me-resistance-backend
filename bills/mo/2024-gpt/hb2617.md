summary: |  
  This bill makes significant changes to how delinquent property taxes are collected in Missouri. It repeals many previous laws related to tax collection and replaces them with new sections that clarify the process. The bill also allows counties to choose different methods for handling unpaid taxes, such as operating under specific provisions if a property has been unpaid for at least two years. These changes aim to improve how the state and local governments manage and enforce property tax collections, affecting county governments, property owners with unpaid taxes, and the overall tax collection process.
