summary_short: "This bill updates rules about driver's licenses, including how suspensions and revocations are handled and how limited driving privileges can be granted under certain circumstances."

summary: |
  This bill makes changes to Missouri laws regarding driver's licenses. It specifies that when a person's license is suspended, it must be returned once the suspension ends and requirements are met. For revoked licenses, individuals must apply for a new license after the revocation period. The bill also allows courts and the Department of Revenue to grant limited driving privileges to drivers who need to operate a vehicle for specific reasons, such as work, medical care, school, religion, or to travel to essential businesses. These privileges help people who would face undue hardship without driving rights, provided they follow certain restrictions. The changes will affect drivers with suspended or revoked licenses, as well as those seeking limited driving privileges for important personal needs.
