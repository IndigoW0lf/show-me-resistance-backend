summary_short: "This bill creates a list of nonnative invasive plants and gives the Missouri Department of Agriculture authority to enforce rules about them."
summary: |
  The bill establishes a "Nonnative Invasive Plant List" in Missouri, identifying plants that could spread widely, outcompete local species, or become established in natural areas. It makes it illegal for people to knowingly import, sell, or distribute these invasive plants without prior approval from the Department of Agriculture. The department will maintain and update this list and can grant permits to allow activities like research or control efforts. People who violate these rules can be fined and may have opportunities for hearings or to enter agreements to correct their actions. This law aims to protect Missouriâ€™s natural environments from invasive plant problems.
