summary: |
  The bill updates laws regarding sales taxes in Missouri counties. It authorizes specific counties—those with populations between approximately 9,900 and 11,000 residents or between 80,000 and 100,000 residents with certain seat populations—to impose a 1% sales tax for recreational purposes. To do so, voters in these counties must approve the tax through a ballot measure. If approved, the tax revenue collected will support local recreational projects like parks and community programs. The bill aims to give these counties a way to fund public recreational facilities while involving voters in the decision.
