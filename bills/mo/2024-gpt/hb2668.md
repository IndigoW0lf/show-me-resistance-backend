summary: |
  This bill establishes the "Missouri Patrol on Wave Runners (MO-POWR) Task Force," a specialized group focused on law enforcement and emergency response on certain Missouri lakes. The task force will include members from state and local government, law enforcement, fire protection districts, Coast Guard, and community organizations. Its goal is to promote water and boating safety on lakes with more than 1,100 miles of shoreline by patrolling with personal watercraft, such as wave runners. The members will appoint a leader and will serve without pay, but can be reimbursed for related expenses. The task force is expected to start meeting before October 1, 2024, and will help ensure safety for boaters, residents, and visitors on these large lakes.
