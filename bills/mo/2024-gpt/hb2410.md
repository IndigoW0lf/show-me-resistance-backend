summary: |
  This bill changes the laws regarding who is appointed to represent children and involved parties in family and child welfare court cases. It requires courts to appoint a specific lawyer, called client-directed counsel, to represent the child's interests throughout the case, from the initial hearing to appeals. The bill clarifies when guardians ad litem are appointed and gives them responsibilities to investigate cases, make recommendations, and advocate for the child's best interests. It also sets standards for the qualifications of lawyers representing children in abuse or neglect cases. These updates aim to improve legal representation for children and ensure their voices are heard in court proceedings.
