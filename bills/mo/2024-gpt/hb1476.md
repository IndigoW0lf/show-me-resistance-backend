summary: |
  This bill makes changes to Missouri laws related to how points are added for traffic offenses and how ignition interlock devices are used. It requires notice to drivers when they accumulate points, and sets new rules for suspending and reinstating driver licenses. If someone has their license suspended due to points or traffic violations, they may be eligible for early reinstatement if they install a certified ignition interlock device on their vehicle. These changes aim to improve safety and ensure proper use of ignition interlock devices for offenders.
