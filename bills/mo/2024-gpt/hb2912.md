summary: |
  This bill allows qualified employers in Missouri to receive a tax credit of up to $1,000 for each state-owned vehicle they purchase and use to transport employees on probation or parole. To qualify, the employee must have been convicted of a felony, be on probation or parole, have a vocational certification, and have worked for the employer full-time for at least 12 months or 46 weeks in a year. Employers can claim this credit for up to four vehicles per year, and must provide proof of purchase and vehicle use to the Department of Revenue. This initiative aims to support employment opportunities for certain individuals with criminal records by encouraging employers to provide transportation for them.
