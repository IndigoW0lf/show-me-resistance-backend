summary_short: "This bill allows certain residential care and assisted living facilities to skip annual inspections if they are accredited by a recognized authority."

summary: |
  This bill helps residential care and assisted living facilities in Missouri by letting those that are accredited by a recognized national organization, such as The Joint Commission, submit proof of their accreditation to the state. If they show they are accredited and in good standing, the state will not require them to undergo the usual annual on-site inspection for that year. However, the state still has the right to conduct inspections if there are concerns or violations of rules. This bill mainly affects facilities with accreditation and aims to reduce unnecessary inspections while maintaining safety standards.
