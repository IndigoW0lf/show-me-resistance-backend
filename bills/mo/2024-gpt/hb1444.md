summary: |
  The bill creates a new tax credit program in Missouri for people and businesses who donate money, property, or stocks to qualified organizations that help individuals involved with the justice system and those recovering from substance use disorders. These organizations must be non-profits under federal law, not too large, and meet specific accreditation standards. The donations can support services like counseling, recovery housing, job training, and transportation. This bill aims to encourage more giving to organizations that assist people in recovery and reduce recidivism, benefiting both the community and the stateâ€™s mental health and criminal justice systems.
