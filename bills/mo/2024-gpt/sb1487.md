summary_short: "This bill creates a statewide licensing system for mechanical contractors in Missouri."

summary: |
  The Missouri Statewide Mechanical Contractor Licensing Act establishes a new license that allows mechanical contractors to work anywhere in the state. It defines what a mechanical contractor is, including the types of work covered such as heating, cooling, plumbing, and refrigeration systems. The bill also sets up the rules and procedures for issuing these licenses through the division of professional registration, making it easier for contractors to operate across local and state boundaries. This will impact mechanical contractors, their employees, and local licensing authorities by streamlining licensing processes and ensuring uniform standards.
