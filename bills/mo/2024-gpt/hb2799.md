summary_short: "This bill requires investment advisers and broker-dealers to disclose if they incorporate social or environmental goals into investment decisions and get clients' written consent beforehand."
summary: |
  This legislation in Missouri aims to increase transparency for people working with investment advisers and broker-dealers. If these financial professionals include social or environmental objectives—like supporting sustainability or social justice—in their investment recommendations, they must clearly disclose this to their clients. Clients need to give written consent before any investment decision is made that considers these non-financial factors. This law helps investors understand when their money is being used to promote social goals and ensures they agree to these considerations upfront.
