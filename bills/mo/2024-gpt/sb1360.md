summary_short: "This bill creates incentives, including tax credits, for companies that convert to produce chemicals, metals, or minerals to reduce reliance on foreign imports and strengthen energy independence in Missouri."

summary: |
  The Missouri Defense and Energy Independence Act encourages companies in Missouri to switch or expand their operations to produce key chemicals, metals, gases, and rare minerals needed for energy and defense projects. If a company makes qualified conversion costs to produce these materials, it can receive tax credits to help offset its taxes, promoting local production and reducing dependence on foreign supplies. The bill sets limits on the total amount of tax credits available each year and defines rules for claiming, transferring, or carrying forward these credits. Additionally, the bill establishes a new fund to support projects and initiatives that help Missouri become more self-reliant in energy and defense-related materials. It directly affects businesses involved in defense contracting or energy projects in Missouri, aiming to boost the state's manufacturing capability and economic independence.
