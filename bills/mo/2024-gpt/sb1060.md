summary_short: "This bill changes the rules for tax credits given for donations to children's support organizations in Missouri."
summary: |
  This bill updates Missouri's laws to allow people who donate to certain children's support organizations—like child advocacy groups, crisis care centers, and court-appointed advocates—to get a larger tax credit. Starting in 2024, donors can claim up to 70% of their contribution as a tax credit, compared to 50% before 2024. The bill also increases the maximum total amount of tax credits that can be claimed each year, with no limit starting in 2024. This helps encourage donations to support vulnerable children and makes it easier for donors to reduce their tax bill. It affects taxpayers, charitable organizations serving children, and the Missouri Department of Revenue.
