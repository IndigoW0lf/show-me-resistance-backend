summary_short: "This bill changes the rules for how quickly the governor must call a special election to fill legislative vacancies in Missouri."
summary: |
  The bill updates the process for filling vacancies in the Missouri General Assembly. It specifies that if a legislator resigns, resigns, or passes away, the governor must issue a call for a special election within seven days under certain conditions. The timing for when the governor must act depends on when the vacancy occurs during the election cycle, particularly related to the last Tuesday in February. These changes aim to make the process more clear and consistent for filling vacant legislative seats, affecting the governor, current and future legislators, and voters in affected districts.
