summary_short: "This resolution asks the federal banking agencies to make it easier to start new banks in Missouri."
summary: |
  The Missouri House of Representatives is urging the Federal Deposit Insurance Corporation (FDIC) to relax some rules to encourage new banks to open in the state. Missouri has lost many local banks over the years, especially in rural areas, creating banking shortages in some communities. The resolution requests the FDIC to lower the initial financial requirements for new banks and to shorten the regulatory process during the first five years, making it easier for new banks to start and grow in Missouri. These changes aim to support local economies and prevent banking deserts that limit access to financial services.
