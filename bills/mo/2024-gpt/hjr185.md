summary: |  
  This bill aims to add a new part to Missouriâ€™s state constitution to ensure that parents have a fundamental right to know what their children are learning in public schools. It includes the right for parents to see school curricula, lesson plans, and a list of all materials available in school libraries. The goal is to increase transparency so parents can be informed about the educational content and resources their children have access to in public schools. This change would go into effect if voters approve it in the upcoming election.
