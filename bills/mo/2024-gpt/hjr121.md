summary_short: "This bill proposes changing the state's definition of marriage to recognize two persons of any gender as valid spouses."

summary: |
  The bill aims to amend Missouriâ€™s Constitution so that marriages are legally recognized between any two people, regardless of whether they are men or women. Currently, the law defines marriage as only between a man and a woman. If approved by voters in the 2024 election, this change would allow for the recognition of same-gender marriages in the state. It affects all residents who want to marry or have their marriage recognized by the government, including same-sex couples.
