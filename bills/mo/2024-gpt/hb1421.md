summary_short: "This bill updates Missouri laws to expand and clarify how telehealth services can be provided and reimbursed, ensuring healthcare providers can use technology to deliver care across locations within the state."

summary: |
  This bill changes Missouri law to make it easier for healthcare providers to offer telehealth services, which include using video, audio, and other electronic methods to see, diagnose, and treat patients remotely. It defines key terms like "originating site" (where the patient is), "distant site" (where the provider is), and includes new rules for the use of asynchronous technology (sending health information back and forth). The bill requires providers to be fully licensed in Missouri and adhere to the same high standards of care as in-person visits. It also clarifies that certain informal or emergency-related telehealth interactions with out-of-state providers do not violate state rules. Overall, it aims to improve access to healthcare through technology while maintaining quality and safety standards.
