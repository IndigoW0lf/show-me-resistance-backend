summary_short: "This bill updates Missouri laws to allow more flexible and secure telehealth and telemedicine services for licensed healthcare providers."
summary: |
  The bill modifies state regulations to expand how healthcare providers can offer telehealth services. It clarifies definitions such as what counts as telehealth, including asynchronous "store-and-forward" technology, and sets rules for where and how providers can deliver care remotely. Providers must be fully licensed in Missouri and follow existing standards of care, just like in-person visits. The law also allows certain informal or emergency telehealth interactions across state lines without changing providers' scope of practice. Overall, the bill aims to make telehealth easier to access while maintaining quality and safety for patients in Missouri.
