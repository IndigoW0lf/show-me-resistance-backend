summary: |
  This bill, called the "Missouri Defense and Energy Independence Act," encourages businesses in Missouri to switch their production to chemicals, metals, gases, or rare minerals that help decrease dependence on imports for energy and defense needs. Companies that make this conversion can earn tax credits based on their qualified costs, up to a certain limit. The program is designed to support local manufacturing and strengthen energy and defense industries by providing financial incentives. It also creates a fund to support this initiative, encouraging more local production of critical resources.
