summary_short: "This bill allows manufactured homes to be moved on highways in Missouri on Saturdays without restrictions."
summary: |
  The bill updates existing rules to make it easier to transport manufactured homes across Missouri. It states that the transportation of these homes on roads, highways, and bridges is permitted on Saturdays, which was previously restricted. To do this, the appropriate permits must be obtained, but the new law prevents any bans or limits specifically on moving manufactured homes on Saturdays within any region of the state. This change benefits homeowners and moving companies by giving them more flexibility to transport manufactured homes on weekends.
