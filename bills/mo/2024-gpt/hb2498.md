summary: |
  This bill changes the rules for public libraries in Missouri that are allowed to collect taxes. It states that these libraries must be governed by an elected library board made up of five members. Existing library boards can keep their current number of members if itâ€™s odd. Elections for board members will only happen on the main election day, and candidates must be at least 18 years old. The bill also defines the responsibilities of the library board, including choosing and managing library materials, overseeing staff and volunteers, approving events, and handling facility projects. These rules aim to make library governance clearer and more accountable to the public.
