summary_short: "This bill changes the rules for getting permits to build and run solid waste processing facilities in Missouri."
summary: |
  The bill updates the laws to make it clearer and more structured for obtaining permits to operate or build solid waste facilities, like recycling centers or landfills, in Missouri. It requires anyone wanting to construct or operate these facilities to first request a preliminary site investigation from the Department of Natural Resources, which has 60 days to respond. Additionally, for new disposal sites proposed after August 28, 1999, there will be public involvement activities, including notifying the community, holding informational sessions, and giving citizens a chance to learn about and comment on the project. These changes are aimed at increasing public transparency and ensuring proper evaluation of waste facilities before they are built or operated.
