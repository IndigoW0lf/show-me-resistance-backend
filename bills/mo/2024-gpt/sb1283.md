summary_short: "This bill updates state rules for sewage system standards, soil testing, and contractor registration to improve sanitation and environmental safety."

summary: |
  This bill modifies Missouri's laws regarding on-site sewage disposal systems. It requires the health department to develop and enforce standards for the location, size, and installation of sewage tanks and lines based on soil properties. The bill also creates a list of qualified soil evaluators, such as trained contractors, engineers, and geologists, who can perform necessary soil tests. Additionally, it establishes a voluntary registration program for sewage system contractors and develops training and educational materials to ensure proper installation and maintenance. Local governments, like cities and counties, can adopt these standards and programs, but if they do not, the state health department will enforce them. The goal is to ensure safe, effective sewage disposal while providing clear guidelines and training for those who install and inspect these systems.
