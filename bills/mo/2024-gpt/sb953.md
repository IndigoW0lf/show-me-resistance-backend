summary: |
  The bill repeals some existing laws about the motor fuel tax and replaces them with new rules. It imposes a tax of seventeen cents per gallon on regular motor fuel and updates the rates for alternative fuels like compressed natural gas, liquefied natural gas, and propane, with different rates for different time periods. The bill also clarifies how these fuels are measured and taxed, and applies existing rules for collection and enforcement. This affects drivers, fuel vendors, and government agencies responsible for fuel taxation and regulation.
