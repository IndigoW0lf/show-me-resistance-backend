summary: |
  This bill states that life begins at conception and that unborn children have important rights to life, health, and well-being. It clarifies that from the moment of conception until birth, unborn children are to be recognized as having the same legal protections as other people, according to Missouri law. The bill also recognizes the rights of biological parents in relation to their unborn children. It does not, however, create any legal cause of action against women for harming their unborn children through their actions or failure to care for themselves during pregnancy.
