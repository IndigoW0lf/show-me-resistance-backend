summary_short: "This bill says police cannot search your vehicle or home just because they smell marijuana."
summary: |
  The new law, HB2132, states that the smell of marijuana alone is not enough for police to legally search your car, house, or private property without a warrant. This means that even if an officer detects the odor, they cannot immediately search or seize your property unless they get a warrant or have other legal reasons. The bill aims to protect people's privacy by preventing searches based solely on the smell of marijuana. It mainly affects individuals who may have marijuana in their vehicles or homes and want to ensure their rights are upheld.
