summary_short: "Allows retired teachers and noncertificated staff to return to work for up to four years to help fill staffing shortages without losing their retirement benefits."

summary: |
  This bill changes the rules for retired school employees in Missouri. It lets retired teachers and noncertified staff return to work full-time for up to four years in schools that need extra help. To qualify, the school must show there is a real shortage of staff, and certain hiring steps must be followed, like posting jobs and trying to fill positions with non-retired staff first. This helps schools with staffing shortages while allowing retirees to continue working without losing their retirement benefits. The bill applies to certain retirement systems and sets limits on how many retired staff can be hired at one time.
