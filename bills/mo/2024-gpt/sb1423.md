summary: |
  This bill mandates that any state agency creating a plan to lower carbon dioxide emissions from electricity providers must focus on using clean energy sources like sunlight, wind, water, and nuclear power. The plan should include modern and cost-effective methods such as improving energy efficiency, upgrading the electrical grid, and using energy storage. It also excludes energy from coal, oil, or natural gas. The goal is to promote cleaner energy and reduce pollution caused by electricity generation, impacting utility companies, energy consumers, and government agencies working on environmental policies.
