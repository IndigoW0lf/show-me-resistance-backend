summary: |
  This bill clarifies that all-terrain vehicles (ATVs) used for agricultural purposes will now be classified as farm machinery and equipment. Because of this classification, these ATVs will qualify for a sales tax exemption typically given to farm-related equipment. The change is intended to support farmers by reducing the taxes they pay on essential farm tools like ATVs used in daily agricultural work. This applies to farmers and agricultural businesses across the state who purchase ATVs for farming activities.
