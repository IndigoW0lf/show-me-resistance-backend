summary: |
  This legislation changes existing laws to make abortion illegal in Missouri, declaring it a matter of protecting innocent human life from conception. It states that unborn children at every stage of development are entitled to the same rights and protections as born individuals. The bill also repeals laws that previously allowed for certain criminal offenses against unborn children, effectively making prenatal homicide and assault illegal. It affects healthcare providers, individuals seeking abortions, and anyone involved in actions against unborn children within the state.
