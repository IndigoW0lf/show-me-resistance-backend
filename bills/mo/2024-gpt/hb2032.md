summary_short: "This bill lets motorcycle riders pass between stopped or slow-moving cars at a safe speed, but does not allow lane splitting between fast-moving vehicles."

summary: |
  This legislation allows motorcycle riders in Missouri to overtake and pass vehicles by traveling between lanes of stopped or slow-moving traffic, as long as they do so safely and at no more than 10 miles per hour over the flow of traffic, with a maximum speed limit of 25 mph. However, it explicitly states that this is not the same as lane splitting, which involves riding between lanes of fast-moving traffic. The law also makes it illegal for other drivers to intentionally block or prevent motorcyclists from using this passing method. Additionally, the Missouri State Highway Patrol is tasked with creating safety guidelines to help motorcycle riders and other drivers understand and safely implement this new practice. This bill primarily affects motorcycle riders, other drivers on the road, and highway safety officials.
