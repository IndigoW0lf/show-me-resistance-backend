summary_short: "This bill proposes an amendment to the Missouri Constitution requiring voter approval for any new or increased state taxes to take effect."
summary: |
  This bill, called HJR84, aims to change the Missouri Constitution so that any new taxes or increases in existing taxes cannot start or continue unless they are approved by voters in a statewide election. This means that before the state can impose or raise taxes, the public must have a say through voting. The bill also states that the state cannot spend any money without it being approved by the legislature first. It affects all residents of Missouri by giving voters more control over tax decisions and ensuring transparency in government taxation policies.
