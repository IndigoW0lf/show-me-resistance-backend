summary_short: "This bill proposes a constitutional change in Missouri to protect gun rights while allowing certain local gun regulations."
summary: |
  The bill aims to revise Missouri's Constitution regarding the right to bear arms. It plans to remove the current gun rights clause and replace it with a new section that guarantees unalienable rights to keep and bear arms, ammunition, and accessories, with some restrictions permitted for convicted violent felons or those deemed a danger due to mental health issues. It also allows cities and counties like St. Louis and Kansas City to pass local laws about firearm possession, including permit systems, background checks, and penalties. These regulations can affect gun owners, law enforcement, and local governments within Missouri.
