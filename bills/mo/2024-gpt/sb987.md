summary: |
  This bill applies to civil court cases in Missouri where a jury decides the outcome. It states that neither the parties involved nor their lawyers can ask the jury to consider or mention exact dollar amounts or ranges for noneconomic damages, such as pain and suffering. The goal is to limit how amounts are discussed during trials to promote fairness and prevent inflating damage estimates. This change mainly affects attorneys and parties involved in civil jury cases, ensuring that specific dollar figures are not used as part of the trial discussions.
