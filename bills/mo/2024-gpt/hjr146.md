summary_short: "This proposed constitutional amendment aims to protect the right to keep and bear arms in Missouri while allowing cities and counties to regulate firearms through local laws."
summary: |
  The bill proposes changing Missouri's constitution to affirm that citizens have an unalienable right to own and carry guns for self-defense, family protection, and property security. It sets guidelines for how restrictions on gun rights are evaluated and specifies that certain restrictions, like those on violent felons or individuals with mental health issues, are allowed. The bill also gives cities like St. Louis and Kansas City the authority to pass local laws regulating the possession, carrying, and transfer of firearms, including permit requirements, fees, and penalties, while respecting existing permits from residents' home counties or states. This affects gun owners, law enforcement, local governments, and anyone interested in gun rights or regulation in Missouri.
