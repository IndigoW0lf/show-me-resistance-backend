summary_short: "This bill proposes changing Missouri's rules for jury trials, including allowing smaller juries and letting defendants choose to waive a jury in criminal cases."
summary: |
  The bill aims to update the Missouri Constitution to keep the right to a jury trial but makes some changes. It allows juries in civil and criminal cases to be smaller than the current standard of twelve members, with specific rules for how many jurors are needed to decide a case. In civil cases, only two-thirds of the jurors need to agree, and in courts of record, three-fourths are required. Additionally, defendants in criminal cases can choose to forgo a jury trial and have their case decided by a judge instead. These changes could affect how trials are conducted and the rights of defendants and plaintiffs.
