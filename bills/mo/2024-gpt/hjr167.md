summary_short: "This bill proposes a constitutional change to protect and clarify gun rights in Missouri, including regulations for cities and counties."
summary: |
  The bill, HJR167, aims to amend Missouriâ€™s Constitution to explicitly protect the right of citizens to keep and bear arms, with certain restrictions for convicted violent felons or individuals deemed a danger due to mental health issues. It also allows cities like St. Louis and Kansas City to create their own firearm regulations through local ordinances, including setting permit fees, issuing permits valid for up to five years, and establishing penalties for violations. These regulations could apply to residents and nonresidents and include exemptions for law enforcement, judges, military members, and licensed security personnel. The change is set to be voted on in the 2024 election and would affect gun owners, local governments, and law enforcement agencies.
