summary_short: "This resolution urges the U.S. to ratify the Equal Rights Amendment to guarantee equal rights regardless of sex."

summary: |
  This bill, HCR32, encourages the United States to fully ratify the Equal Rights Amendment (ERA), which aims to ensure that no one is denied or restricted from rights under the law based on their sex. It explains how the ERA was proposed in 1972 and highlights that previous attempts to set a ratification deadline were not legally binding because the deadline was not included in the actual amendment text. The bill emphasizes that only the text of the amendment, not preamble statements, can legally establish such deadlines. It also compares the ERA to other amendments with official time limits, showing that deadlines that are part of the text have expired, while the ERA remains unratified. The resolution aims to remind and encourage Congress and states to complete the ratification process so the ERA can become part of the U.S. Constitution, providing equal rights for all regardless of sex.
