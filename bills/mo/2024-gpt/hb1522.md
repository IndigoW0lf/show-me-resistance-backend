summary_short: "This bill makes it easier for counties in Missouri to choose whether to create or stop using an alternative highway commission through voter approval or local decisions."

summary: |
  This bill changes the rules about alternative county highway commissions in Missouri. It says that counties can only set up an alternative highway commission if most voters in the county vote in favor of it during an election. If a county has already adopted this alternative commission, they can also vote to abolish it. If a county chooses not to adopt the alternative system or votes to end it, they must keep using the standard county highway commission or another established system for managing roads. The bill impacts county governments and voters who decide on local highway management options.
