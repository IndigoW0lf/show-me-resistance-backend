summary_short: "Allows counties with over 1 million residents to impose a small sales tax to fund early childhood education, subject to voter approval."
summary: |
  This bill gives large counties—those with more than one million people—the authority to add a very small sales tax (up to 0.25%) on retail sales within the county. The money collected from this tax would be used only to support early childhood educational services, helping young children get quality education and care. Before the tax can be collected, voters in the county must approve it through a special election. The funds collected will go into a dedicated trust fund and be used solely for early childhood programs, with most administrative details handled by the state's Department of Revenue. This means residents in eligible counties may see a new tax to improve preschool and early childhood services, with the decision made directly by voters.
