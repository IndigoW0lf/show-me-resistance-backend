summary_short: "This bill proposes to cap the state income tax rate at 5.5% and restrict new sales taxes, limiting tax increases for Missouri residents."
summary: |
  The bill modifies Missouri's constitution to place limits on taxes. It sets a maximum state income tax rate of 5.5%, allowing the legislature to define income using federal laws but cap the rate. It also restricts the expansion of sales and use taxes, preventing new taxes on most services or transactions introduced after January 1, 2015, with specific exceptions like digital subscriptions and online purchases. If new sales taxes are added after January 1, 2025, they must be offset by an equivalent reduction in the state income tax rate. The change aims to protect Missouri citizens from higher taxes and ensure tax policy remains fair and predictable.
