summary: |
  This bill changes the way Missouri funds services for crime victims. It repeals the current Crime Victims' Compensation Fund and creates new provisions, including a new fund called the Victims of Domestic Violence Fund. It increases the court-related surcharge from seven to seventeen dollars and fifty cents for all criminal cases, which helps fund victim services. The money collected will be used to support crime labs, administrative costs for victim offices, and victim notification systems. The bill also directs the allocation of these funds monthly, ensuring they are split between compensating victims and supporting victim services, including those for domestic violence survivors. These changes aim to improve funding for victim support programs across the state.
