summary_short: "This bill prevents state departments from spending funds on programs related to diversity, equity, and inclusion that promote certain ideologies or preferences based on race, gender, or other identity factors."

summary: |
  This bill makes it illegal for state government departments to use money for programs or initiatives that focus on diversity, equity, and inclusion if those programs promote special treatment based on race, gender, or ethnicity, or if they promote ideas like that disparities are only caused by oppression. It also bans funding for programs that promote collective guilt, divisive identity activism, or limit free speech and conscience. However, state departments can still follow federal and state anti-discrimination laws, including accessibility rules like the Americans with Disabilities Act. The bill also prohibits the state from requiring private companies that do business with the state to adopt these kinds of programs as a condition for contracts.
