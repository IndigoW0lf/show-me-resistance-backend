summary_short: "This bill limits the fees organizations can charge when distributing funds for social and education programs."

summary: |
  The bill sets maximum fee limits for organizations that contract with the Missouri Department of Social Services and the Department of Elementary and Secondary Education to distribute funds to community programs. If these organizations receive less than one million dollars, they cannot keep more than 5% of the funds as fees. If they receive one million dollars or more, their fees are limited to 3%. This helps ensure more money reaches the community programs that provide services, rather than being taken out as fees by the distributing organizations.
