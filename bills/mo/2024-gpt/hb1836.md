summary: |
  This bill changes how solar energy properties are taxed in Missouri. Starting January 1, 2025, any solar property built or contracted to sell power by the end of 2024 will be considered of very low value for property assessments. The property tax for such solar projects will not exceed $1,000 per megawatt, even if land is reclassified due to the project. The bill also clarifies that existing tax agreements and financing arrangements related to solar projects remain valid and unaffected. Additionally, properties that were exempted from property taxes in a given year will not owe taxes for that year, providing some tax relief for solar energy facilities and related landowners.
