summary: |
  This bill helps protect federally-qualified health centers and pharmacies that dispense discounted 340B drugs from unfair practices. It prevents insurance companies and pharmacy benefits managers from paying less or imposing stricter conditions on these providers simply because they dispense 340B drugs. The bill also makes it illegal to charge higher prices, refuse coverage, or impose extra requirements on these providers or pharmacies. Overall, it aims to promote fair treatment and support the affordability of essential medicines for underserved patients.
