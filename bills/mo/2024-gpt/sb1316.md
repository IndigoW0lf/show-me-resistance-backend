summary: |
  This bill changes the laws regarding how local governments in Missouri collect franchise fees from video service companies, like cable or internet TV providers. It clarifies what counts as gross revenue for calculating these fees and specifics on what expenses and income are included or excluded. The aim is to create clearer rules for how video service providers are taxed and to specify which local government areas and authorities are involved. This affects both the companies providing video services and the local governments that collect fees from them.
