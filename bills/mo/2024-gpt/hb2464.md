summary: |
  The bill repeals the existing law on income exemptions from earnings tax and replaces it with a revised list. It specifies certain organizations and types of income that do not have to pay earnings tax, such as religious, charitable, educational groups, and mutual or cooperative organizations. It also clarifies that certain insurance companies, federal land banks, and express companies are exempt from earnings tax. This change affects these groups by potentially reducing their tax burden, making it important for them to understand whether their income qualifies for exemption.
