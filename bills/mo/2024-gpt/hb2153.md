summary_short: "This bill requires a permit for anyone who wants to export water from Missouri outside the state, and sets rules for approving these permits."
summary: |
  The bill makes it illegal to transfer water from Missouri to another state without a special permit from the Missouri Department of Natural Resources. To get this permit, the applicant must prove that they have enough water available, plan to use it beneficially, and that their use won't interfere with existing or future uses within Missouri. Once the application is reviewed, the director will recommend approval or denial to the state legislature. The legislature then has the authority to approve or reject the permit through a formal resolution. This bill affects businesses, water users, and state agencies involved in water management and export.
