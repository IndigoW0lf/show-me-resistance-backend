summary: |
  The bill changes the rules for Missouri driver's licenses and nondriver's licenses by adding a symbol that indicates the person is a United States citizen. Starting July 1, 2031, licenses for U.S. citizens will display this special mark. This helps identify U.S. citizens more easily and may impact voting procedures, as certain forms of ID are needed to vote. It also clarifies how people can prove their identity when voting if they do not have the required ID forms.
