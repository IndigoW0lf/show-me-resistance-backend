summary: |
  This bill requires Missouri to reduce the maximum amount of vinyl chloride, a harmful chemical, allowed in public drinking water. Starting January 1, 2025, the limit will be 1.8 parts per billion (ppb), then decrease each year until it reaches 1 ppb by January 1, 2029. It affects public water systems and ensures they keep water safe for everyone. Water providers will need to update their regulations to follow these new limits, helping protect public health from chemical exposure.
