summary_short: "This bill updates how Missouri assesses the value of real estate for tax purposes, including new rules for market conditions, income-based assessments for certain properties, and a depreciation schedule for residential properties."
summary: |
  This bill changes the laws about how property values are determined for property tax assessments in Missouri. It requires assessors to consider current market conditions, such as foreclosures and bank sales, when setting property values. The bill introduces an income-based method for valuing properties that have specific federal or state restrictions or subsidies related to housing. Starting in 2025, the bill also establishes that the true value of residential property will be based on the price paid when the owner bought the property, with a set depreciation schedule applying to future reassessments. This means that property taxes may be calculated differently, potentially benefiting property owners and affecting local revenues.
