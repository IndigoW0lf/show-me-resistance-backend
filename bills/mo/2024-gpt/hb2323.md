summary_short: "This bill changes the age at which children must start school and updates attendance rules for young children in Missouri."
summary: |
  This bill adjusts Missouri's school attendance law by lowering the starting age for mandatory school enrollment from seven to six years old. It requires parents, guardians, or those responsible for children aged six and older to ensure the child is enrolled in an approved educational program and attends regularly. The bill also defines what counts as a "home school" and specifies rules for excusing children from attendance due to health, disability, or employment reasons. These changes mainly affect families with young children and the operations of private and home schools in the state.
