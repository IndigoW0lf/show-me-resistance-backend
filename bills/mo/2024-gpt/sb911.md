summary: |
  The bill, SB911, makes it so that only the state can set the rules for selling tobacco, alternative nicotine, and vapor products. Local governments like counties and cities cannot create tougher regulations or laws related to these products. It also states that if a business has had a license within the past 24 months, the same or a new business at that location cannot be denied a license again, as long as they follow existing laws. This bill affects businesses selling these products and local governments responsible for licensing and regulation.
