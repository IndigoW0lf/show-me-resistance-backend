summary: |
  The bill, HJR92, aims to amend the Missouri Constitution to guarantee ongoing funding for certain criminal justice workers, like sheriffs and prosecutors, who play a key role in the justice system. It will be presented to voters in the 2024 election for approval. If approved, it will ensure that costs supporting these personnel, including their salaries and benefits, are maintained as part of the state's budget for justice services. This impacts law enforcement agencies, prosecutors, and the overall criminal justice system by protecting their funding, helping to keep courts operational and justice accessible for all Missourians.
