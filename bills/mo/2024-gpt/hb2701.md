summary: |
  The bill allows the superintendent of the Missouri Highway Patrol to create policies for increasing patrol salaries. Each year before January 1st, the superintendent must send a report to the governor and legislative leaders comparing highway patrol salaries with those of police departments in Missouri's largest cities and nearby states. The report also includes suggestions from the governor and may be reviewed by legislative committees to keep salaries fair and competitive. Additionally, the bill clarifies that service in the U.S. Armed Forces after a partial honorable discharge can count as patrol service, with some restrictions. This affects highway patrol members, government officials, and policymakers involved in law enforcement staffing and budgeting.
