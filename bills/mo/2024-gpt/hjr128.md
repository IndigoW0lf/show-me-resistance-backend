summary_short: "This bill proposes a constitutional change to how motor fuel tax proceeds are collected and distributed to help fund roads and transportation across Missouri."

summary: |
  The bill aims to amend Missouriâ€™s Constitution regarding the way money from motor fuel taxes is used. It would remove the current rules and establish new rules for collecting and dividing the revenue from fuel taxes. The money collected from fuel taxes will be split between the state, counties, and cities, and specifically allocated for road and highway projects. This change is intended to ensure that funds are properly earmarked for transportation improvements and are distributed fairly to local governments and the state.
