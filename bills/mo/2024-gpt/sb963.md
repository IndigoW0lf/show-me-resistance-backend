summary: |
  This bill changes existing laws to regulate telephone calls made between businesses. It defines who qualifies as a business or residential caller and sets rules about when such calls are allowed. Businesses must respect a list of phone numbers maintained by the attorney general, which indicates people or other businesses who do not want to receive these calls. The law aims to limit unwanted business-to-business and business-to-consumer telemarketing activities, giving people and businesses more control over their phone information.
