summary_short: "This bill requires health insurance plans to cover prostheses for hair loss caused by chemotherapy for people of all ages starting in 2025, and for children under 18 due to alopecia starting now."

summary: |
  This bill changes the rules about what health insurance plans must cover. Starting January 1, 2025, all health plans in Missouri will have to pay for scalp hair prostheses for people experiencing hair loss from chemotherapy. Additionally, plans that cover children under 18 already must pay for prostheses caused by conditions like alopecia (a hair loss condition). There are limits on the benefits: up to $200 per year and a total of $3,200 for permanent hair prostheses during a person's lifetime. The bill ensures that such coverage is equal to other health services and allows insurance companies to offer better coverage if they want. This bill helps individuals losing hair due to medical treatments or conditions by making prostheses more accessible and financially supported.
