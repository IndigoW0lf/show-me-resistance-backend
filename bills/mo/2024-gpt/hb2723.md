summary: |
  The Healthy Pets Act requires commercial breeders in Missouri to follow stricter health and care rules for animals they breed. They must perform genetic testing, vaccinations, X-ray screenings for hip issues, and regular veterinarian exams for both male and female breeding animals, with proper records and photographs kept. Before selling a pet, breeders must also provide documentation of medical care and breed history. Additionally, pet shops and dealers cannot buy animals from breeders with recent violations of animal care laws or who have been guilty of animal abuse or neglect. This law aims to improve the health of pets, ensure humane breeding practices, and hold breeders and sellers accountable.
