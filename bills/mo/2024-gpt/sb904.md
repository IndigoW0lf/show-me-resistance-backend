summary: |
  This bill sets up specific insurance rules for people who share their personal vehicles through peer-to-peer car sharing platforms, like Turo or Getaround. It defines terms such as when the car sharing period begins and ends, and clarifies how insurance should work during these times. The goal is to ensure that both vehicle owners and drivers have proper coverage while participating in car sharing, without affecting existing laws on rentals or vehicle regulations. This bill mainly impacts individuals who rent out their personal vehicles and the companies that operate these sharing platforms.
