summary: |
  The Firefighters Procedural Bill of Rights Act establishes rules to protect firefighters from unfair treatment, especially during investigations. It defines who is considered a firefighter and what actions are considered punishments. The law allows firefighters to participate in political activities, like running for school or local government boards, without fear of interference. It also sets specific procedures for questioning firefighters under investigation, such as conducting interrogations during reasonable hours and informing firefighters of the investigation details beforehand. These rules are designed to ensure firefighters are treated fairly and their rights are upheld.
