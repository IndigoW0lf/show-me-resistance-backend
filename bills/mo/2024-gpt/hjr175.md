summary_short: "A proposed Missouri constitutional amendment aims to strengthen gun rights while allowing local governments to regulate firearms through ordinances."
summary: |
  This bill proposes amending the Missouri Constitution to clarify that citizens have an unalienable right to keep and bear arms for personal defense and other lawful reasons. It maintains that restrictions on these rights must be carefully justified and that the state must protect against infringement. Additionally, it allows cities and counties like St. Louis and Kansas City to create laws regulating firearm possession and carrying, including issuing permits and setting penalties, as long as they follow certain rules. The measure affects gun owners, law enforcement, and local governments by defining how firearm regulations can be made and enforced within cities and counties.
