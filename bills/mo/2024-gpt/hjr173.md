summary_short: "This bill proposes a constitutional change in Missouri to protect citizens' right to keep and bear arms, with new rules for local gun ordinances and exceptions for certain individuals."
summary: |
  The bill aims to update Missouri's constitution regarding gun rights by removing the current restrictions and establishing a new right for citizens to keep and carry guns, ammunition, and related accessories for self-defense and other lawful purposes. It also allows local governments like counties and cities to create their own regulations on gun possession and carrying, including issuing permits and setting penalties, as long as they follow certain rules. These local laws can apply to both residents and nonresidents, and specific exemptions are made for law enforcement, judges, military, and security personnel. The bill emphasizes that the fundamental right to bear arms is unalienable and requires any restrictions to be carefully scrutinized to protect this right.
