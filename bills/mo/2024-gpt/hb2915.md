summary_short: "Requires doctors in Missouri to complete two hours of training on implicit bias as part of their continuing education."
summary: |
  This bill mandates that physicians in Missouri include at least two hours of training on implicit bias every two years. The training is intended to help doctors better understand how unconscious biases can affect their perceptions and treatment decisions. It also aims to reduce disparities in healthcare that can arise from biases related to race, ethnicity, gender, age, or socioeconomic status. Only courses approved by the medical board or organizations approved by the board can be used to fulfill this requirement. The goal is to promote fairer, more equitable healthcare for all patients.
