summary: |
  This bill changes the rules about taxing retirement income in Missouri. It ensures that certain pension and retirement payments above specific amounts are taxed the same as other income. The bill also provides some deductions for retirement benefits, especially for lower-income taxpayers and those receiving privately funded retirement payments. These changes mainly apply to tax years ending on or before December 31, 2006, and could impact retirees and individuals with retirement savings by adjusting the amount of their income that is taxed or deducted.
