summary_short: "This bill updates the rules for special license plates for disabled American veterans in Missouri."
summary: |
  The bill simplifies the process for eligible disabled American veterans to get special license plates that display the organization's emblem. Veterans who have a valid membership card can apply for these personalized plates by paying a small fee and providing identification. The plates include specific design features, such as reflective material and the organization's emblem, and can be issued without additional costs for personalization. There is no limit to how many plates a veteran can request for vehicles they own, and the plates are non-transferable except in certain circumstances. This bill helps disabled veterans show their service and support through their vehicle registration.
