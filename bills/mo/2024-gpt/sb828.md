summary_short: "This bill gives law enforcement officers a tax deduction for part of their income starting in 2025."
summary: |
  The bill, called the "Back the Blue Act," allows certain law enforcement officers in Missouri to deduct a percentage of their income from their state taxes each year beginning in 2025. Officers such as patrol members, peace officers, and federal law enforcement personnel can deduct a share of their salary up to $100,000, with the percentage gradually increasing each year until 100% is deductible in 2028. This means eligible officers could pay less in Missouri state income taxes as a reward for their service. The bill affects active law enforcement officers and federal officers working in Missouri, and the Department of Revenue will oversee how the deduction is implemented.
