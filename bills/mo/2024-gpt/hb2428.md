summary: |
  This bill changes the rules for licensing lawyers in Missouri. It gives the Supreme Court alone the authority to admit and license attorneys. Starting by January 1, 2026, the Court will create a new program that lets people become lawyers by working under supervision, instead of only passing a traditional exam. This program must be fully in place by December 31, 2027. The bill aims to provide more flexible ways for aspiring lawyers to qualify and to modernize the licensing process.
