summary: |
  The bill specifies that most dogs and cats in shelters must be euthanized using a drug called sodium pentobarbital or a similar approved substance. It bans other methods like gas chambers, electrocution, gunshots, or blunt force trauma, unless a clinically proven humane alternative is available and officially recognized. The law ensures that only trained licensed veterinarians or doctors perform euthanasia to ensure it is done humanely. The bill also includes provisions for temporarily using alternative humane drugs if there is a shortage of sodium pentobarbital, as approved by the Veterinary Medical Association.
