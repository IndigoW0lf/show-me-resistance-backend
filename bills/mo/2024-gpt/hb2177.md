summary: |
  The bill adjusts Missouri's laws about when children should begin school and who is responsible for their attendance. It lowers the starting age from seven to six years old, meaning children are required to enroll and attend school at age six. It also clarifies the conditions under which children can be excused from attending school, such as due to illness, employment, or parental request. The bill defines what counts as a home school and sets requirements for record-keeping by parents who choose to homeschool. Overall, it aims to better specify school entry age and ensure children attend school regularly or are properly excused.
