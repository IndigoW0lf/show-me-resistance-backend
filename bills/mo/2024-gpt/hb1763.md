summary_short: "This bill updates procedures for prosecuting criminal cases and allows the governor to appoint special prosecutors or suspend prosecutors if needed."
summary: |
  This bill makes several changes related to prosecutors in Missouri. It requires the attorney general to publish a report summarizing prosecution data across the state, which will be shared with government officials and the public. If a county or city prosecutor is unable or unwilling to do their job—especially in cases of widespread crime or corruption—the governor can appoint special prosecutors to handle cases, and these prosecutors will have the same authority as the local prosecutors. Additionally, the governor has the power to suspend a prosecutor for neglect or failure to perform their duties and can appoint someone to serve temporarily until the next election. These measures aim to ensure that criminal cases are prosecuted effectively and that the public’s safety is maintained.
