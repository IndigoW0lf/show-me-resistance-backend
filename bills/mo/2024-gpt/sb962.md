summary_short: "This bill changes how cities in Missouri can impose and extend earnings taxes, giving voters more say."
summary: |
  The bill modifies Missouri laws about city earnings taxes, which are taxes on income, wages, and business profits. It states that starting in 2011, voters in each city will decide whether to continue or phase out these taxes every five or ten years, depending on the city size. Cities that already had earnings taxes before November 2, 2010, can keep them if voters approve regularly. The bill also restricts cities that didnâ€™t have earnings taxes as of 2010 from imposing them now. This affects local governments and residents by increasing voter control over income and business tax decisions.
