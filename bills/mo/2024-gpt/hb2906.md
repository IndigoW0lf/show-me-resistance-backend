summary_short: "This bill allows retired educators to work part-time in certain school jobs without losing their retirement benefits, within specific time and salary limits."

summary: |
  This bill changes the rules for retired public school employees in Missouri who want to return to work. It allows them to be employed part-time or as substitutes for up to 550 hours a year, earning up to half of the regular salary for their position. If they work more than the allowed hours or earn more than the set limits, they may lose their retirement payments for those months or be required to repay the excess amount. These rules apply to retirees working in school-related jobs, including substitute teachers and contracted workers, and aim to let experienced educators contribute to schools while maintaining their retirement benefits.
