summary: |
  This bill, called the Missouri Child Tax Credit Act, introduces a new tax credit for families with children under 17 years old. If you are a Missouri resident and claim a child as a dependent, you may qualify for a refundable credit on your state taxes. The amount depends on the child's age: $1,800 for children under 6, and $1,500 for children 6 to 16. The credit can be claimed for up to six children or a total of $10,000 per year. It is designed to help families with the costs of caring for children and can be received in advance as monthly payments. The rules ensure children are only claimed by one parent and that the tax year is at least 12 months long, benefiting vulnerable and low-to-moderate income families.
