summary: |
  This bill allows the governor to appoint a special prosecutor in areas with high homicide rates to help tackle serious crimes. The governor can do this if crime statistics show a significant increase in homicides. The special prosecutor can then be responsible for prosecuting certain major felonies like murder, robbery, and assault, as well as crimes against police officers. They are paid by the state and have the authority to handle specific cases exclusively, helping improve accountability and efficiency in criminal prosecutions in troubled communities.
