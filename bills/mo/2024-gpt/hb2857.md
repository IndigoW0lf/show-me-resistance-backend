summary: |
  This bill requires firearm owners in Missouri to register their guns with the stateâ€™s attorney general. Both residents and nonresidents who possess firearms must submit a form with details about themselves and their guns, such as the type, model, and serial number. The registry will be kept secret and only accessible to law enforcement with a warrant, but the state may share anonymous data, like the number of guns in different areas. This aims to improve firearm tracking and law enforcement access while respecting privacy. The registry affects anyone in Missouri who owns or brings firearms into the state.
