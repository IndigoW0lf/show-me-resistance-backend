  The Building Permit Reform Act simplifies rules for homeowners who live in and manage small, non-commercial renovations or repairs on their own homes. It states that homeowners can perform certain work—like replacing appliances or fixing walls—without getting permits or licenses, as long as they do the work themselves. If a homeowner sells the property within a year after completing work, the local government can charge a one-time fee of up to $5,000. The law also sets deadlines for inspections, requiring municipalities to perform inspections quickly or refund part of the fee if they delay. It applies mainly to single-family homes and does not cover rental properties, major modifications, or work involving gas appliances or water/sewer connections. Overall, it reduces red tape and costs for homeowners doing minor repairs or replacements.
