summary_short: "This bill updates Missouri laws to criminalize the unlawful posting of personal information online with new penalties based on intent and harm."
summary: |
  This bill changes existing laws to make it a crime to post someone's personal information, like their name, address, or Social Security number, on the internet if done with harmful intent. If someone posts this information to threaten, harm, or intimidate another person, or to gain financially, they can face serious criminal penalties. The severity of the punishment depends on whether the posting was meant to cause harm or death, especially if it targets law enforcement or judicial officials, with higher penalties for threats or harm resulting from the posting. The law also includes protections for the families of affected individuals and specifies harsher penalties if the posting results in actual physical harm or death. This legislation aims to protect individuals from online threats and harassment through the unlawful sharing of personal information.
