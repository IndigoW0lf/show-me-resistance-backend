summary: |
  The bill changes the rules for how veterans can prove their service to get a special veteran designation on their Missouri driver's license or ID card. Veterans can now use several types of official documents, such as specific military discharge papers, government-issued ID cards, or retirement documents, to qualify. This makes it easier for veterans to have their military service recognized on their license. It also specifies that the veteran designation will be placed on the front of the card and requires payment of the usual fee. The bill applies to current and future applicants who want to display their veteran status, promoting recognition and pride for those who served.
