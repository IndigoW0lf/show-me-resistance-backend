summary_short: "This bill provides matching grant funds to help school districts with renovation projects to improve school facilities and environment."
summary: |
  This legislation creates a program that offers financial grants to school districts in Missouri for renovation projects. The goal is to help upgrade or repair key school facilities, like roofs, heating, ventilation, air conditioning, and windows, to maintain a safe and healthy learning environment. School districts can apply for these grants each year, and the state will match funds to support eligible renovation projects. The program is designed to ensure that schools maintain their facilities and benefit from state support, with funds staying in the dedicated grant fund instead of reverting to the general budget.
