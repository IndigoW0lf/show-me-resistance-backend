summary: |
  This bill makes it possible for students who do not live in a school district to attend public and charter schools within Missouri. It updates rules for how these schools can admit nonresident students, including those from other districts, students in care facilities, and children of employees. The bill also sets guidelines to ensure admission is fair, giving preferences to siblings, students from certain areas, high-risk students, and those eligible for free or reduced lunch. It aims to expand access to education for more students while maintaining fair, non-discriminatory enrollment practices.
