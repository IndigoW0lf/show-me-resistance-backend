summary: |
  This bill changes the rules about paying restitution for people convicted of specific crimes in Missouri. If someone is found guilty of violating certain laws, they will now be ordered by the court to pay money back to the victims. The law sets a minimum of $3,000 per image or item related to the offense, or $5,000 per charge for serious offenses like distribution of illegal images or pornography. The victims can also request money to cover things like medical bills, therapy, or lost work. This affects offenders, victims, courts, and law enforcement by emphasizing financial restitution and victim support.
