summary: |
  This bill changes the rules about employing young people under 18 in Missouri. It eliminates the old requirement that children need a work certificate or entertainment permit to be hired and prevents government agencies or employers from demanding these certificates as a condition of employment. The bill also requires parents or guardians to give written permission before children aged 14 to 15 can work, and it sets specific rules for children working in the entertainment industry, including parent or guardian presence during work. Overall, these updates aim to make it easier for young people to work while ensuring their safety and education are protected.
