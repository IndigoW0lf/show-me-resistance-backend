summary_short: "This bill makes county prosecutors into state employees starting January 1, 2025, with benefits and salary adjustments based on prison populations."  
summary: |
  This bill changes the way county prosecutors are classified. Starting January 1, 2025, prosecutors in Missouri will become employees of the state, specifically under the office of the attorney general. Because of this change, they will be eligible for state employee benefits like health insurance and retirement plans. The bill also includes provisions for additional compensation for prosecutors based on the number of inmates in nearby correctional facilities, with larger populations earning higher extra payments. It affects prosecutors in counties with certain prison populations and ensures they are treated as state employees for salary and benefit purposes.
