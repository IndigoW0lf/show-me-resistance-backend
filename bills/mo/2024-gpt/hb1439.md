summary_short: "This bill allows certain cities in Missouri to ask voters for permission to impose a small tax on hotel stays to support tourism efforts."
summary: |
  The bill gives cities in Missouri with populations between 10,000 and 11,000 that are county seats in counties with populations between 100,000 and 120,000 the ability to introduce a hotel guest tax. This tax would be up to 6% on the cost of hotel or motel rooms paid by short-term visitors (those staying 31 days or less). Before collecting the tax, the city must put the question to voters in an election, and it only takes effect if voters approve it. This means tourists staying in hotels would pay a small additional fee that would help fund local tourism projects or improvements.
