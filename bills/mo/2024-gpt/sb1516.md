summary: |
  This bill changes the rules around vehicle emissions inspections in Missouri. It states that some counties, based on their population size, will no longer be required to have emissions inspection programs. Specifically, larger or certain smaller counties with specific population ranges are exempt. The goal is to adjust how emissions testing is managed across the state, potentially reducing requirements for some counties while ensuring overall air quality goals are met. This change mainly affects vehicle owners and residents in those specific counties by possibly removing the need for vehicle emissions testing there.
