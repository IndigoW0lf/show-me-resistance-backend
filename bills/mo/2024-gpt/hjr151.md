summary_short: "This bill proposes a constitutional change in Missouri to clearly protect citizens' right to keep and bear arms, and allows cities and counties to regulate firearm possession locally."
summary: |
  This bill, known as HJR 151, aims to amend the Missouri Constitution to strengthen the legal rights of people to own and carry guns. It removes the current language that limits these rights and replaces it with a new section that guarantees unalienable rights to keep and bear arms, including ammunition and accessories. The bill also specifies that law restrictions on gun rights must be very carefully justified ("strict scrutiny") and that the state must protect these rights. Additionally, it gives cities like St. Louis and Kansas City the authority to create local laws regulating firearm possession, including issuing permits, setting fees, and establishing penalties, while respecting existing permits from other jurisdictions and certain exemptions for law enforcement, judges, and military personnel.
