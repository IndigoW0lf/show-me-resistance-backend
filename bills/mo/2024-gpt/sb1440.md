summary_short: "This bill bans schools and postsecondary institutions in Missouri from being part of athletic associations that allow students to use performance-enhancing drugs and from competing in teams opposite their biological sex."
summary: |
  This bill prohibits public and private schools, as well as colleges and universities, from being members of any statewide athletic organization that permits students to use performance-enhancing drugs. It also restricts students from competing in sports teams designated for the opposite sex based on their biological sex, as shown on their birth certificates or government records, unless no equivalent team exists for their sex. The law aims to ensure fair competition, protect opportunities for female athletes, and prevent schools from supporting or participating in organizations that allow drug use in sports. Schools that violate these rules could lose state funding, and students who are denied athletic opportunities due to violations may pursue legal action for relief.
