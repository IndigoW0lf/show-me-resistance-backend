summary_short: "This law limits local governments from creating rules about minimum wages and employment benefits that go beyond state law."
summary: |
  This bill prevents local governments, such as cities or counties, from passing their own rules about wages and employment benefits that are higher or more detailed than what the state of Missouri sets by law. It also restricts local regulations on things like employee work hours, scheduling, leave time, participation in training programs, and dispute resolution related to wages or benefits. However, local governments can still pass rules about employment discrimination or background checks for licenses. The bill aims to create a uniform set of employment rules across the state and prevent local variations that could complicate businesses and workers.
