summary_short: "This bill improves how Missouri reviews and reports maternal deaths to better understand and prevent them."

summary: |
  This bill creates a Pregnancy-Associated Mortality Review Board within the Missouri Department of Health and Senior Services. The board will review all maternal deaths—deaths of women during pregnancy or within a year after pregnancy—regardless of where or how they happened. Its goal is to gather better data, identify causes, and develop strategies to reduce maternal mortality. The board will include diverse members from medical, public health, and community groups, and will meet at least twice a year to make recommendations for improving maternal health and safety across Missouri.
