summary: |
  This bill allows licensed orthotists and prosthetists to evaluate and start treatment for patients without needing a doctor's prescription, as long as they are certified by the appropriate national boards. It also requires health insurance plans in Missouri to cover prosthetic and orthotic devices and related services provided by these specialists, with clear rules for approvals and payments. The goal is to improve access to prosthetic and orthotic care for people needing these devices and to clarify the responsibilities of healthcare providers and insurers.
