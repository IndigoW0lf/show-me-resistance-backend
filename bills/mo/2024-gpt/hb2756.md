summary: |
  The bill replaces existing laws related to the Property Assessment Clean Energy Act with new provisions. It clarifies key terms, such as what counts as energy efficiency or renewable energy improvements, and explains how financing works through assessments paid over time. The law allows municipalities and energy boards to offer financing options to property owners who want to make energy-saving upgrades, such as better insulation, energy-efficient windows, or new heating and cooling systems. This helps property owners fund improvements with local assessments paid over up to 20 years, making energy upgrades more affordable. The bill mainly affects property owners, municipalities, and organizations involved in financing or implementing energy efficiency projects.
