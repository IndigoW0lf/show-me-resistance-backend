summary_short: "This bill changes the mileage limits for historic vehicle license plates in Missouri."
summary: |
  The bill allows owners of certain historic vehicles to drive up to 2,500 miles per year for personal use, which is an increase from the previous limit. It requires owners to keep a mile log when driving their vehicle on state roads. The bill also updates rules about registering old license plates, making it easier for owners to use plates that match the vehicle's original year, even if they are not reflective or have the same design. These changes mainly affect owners of vintage or historic cars in Missouri, giving them more flexibility in how much they can drive their vehicles while maintaining registration requirements.
