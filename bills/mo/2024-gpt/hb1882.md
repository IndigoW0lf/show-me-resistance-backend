summary: |
  This bill removes the legal option of the death penalty in Missouri. Instead of death, anyone convicted of a capital crime will now face life in prison without the possibility of parole. The bill also updates how crimes are classified and how sentences are determined, making the system clearer and more consistent. This change affects courts, prosecutors, defense attorneys, and anyone involved in criminal justice, ensuring that all severe crimes are punished with life imprisonment rather than the death penalty.
