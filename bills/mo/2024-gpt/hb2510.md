summary_short: "This bill creates a process for automatic voter registration using driver and ID card information in Missouri."
summary: |
  The bill requires the Secretary of State’s office to set up a system that automatically registers eligible voters based on their driver’s license or ID card information before January 1, 2025. It involves sharing information between the Department of Revenue and local election authorities to help identify people who should be registered to vote. When someone is released from probation, parole, or incarceration, their information will also be provided to add them to the voter list if they are eligible. The process includes a notification step, giving individuals a chance to decline registration if they choose. This new automatic registration method works alongside existing methods and depends on funding and proper rules for implementation.
