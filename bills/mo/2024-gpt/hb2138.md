summary_short: "This bill limits foreign ownership of agricultural land in Missouri, banning new acquisitions by aliens or foreign businesses after August 28, 2024."
summary: |
  The bill changes existing laws to restrict foreign ownership of agricultural land in Missouri. Starting August 28, 2024, no foreign individuals or businesses will be allowed to purchase or otherwise acquire agricultural land in the state. It also prohibits the transfer of agricultural land held by foreigners after this date, with certain exceptions for land acquired before then. The goal is to ensure that agricultural land remains primarily in the hands of Missouri residents and businesses, and it involves oversight by the Department of Agriculture to review proposed land transfers. This bill impacts foreign investors, agricultural landholders, and companies involved in land transactions.
