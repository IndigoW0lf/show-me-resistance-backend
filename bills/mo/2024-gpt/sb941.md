summary: |
  This bill sets up a new legal process that allows individuals to sue private contractors who repair or build public highways or roads if they are injured or if someone dies due to dangerous conditions caused by that work. It specifies what proof is needed for such a claim and states that the contractor can defend themselves if they followed all relevant safety and construction standards. The bill also limits how much money can be awarded in these cases, capping damages at $2 million total per accident and $300,000 per person. It applies to private companies working on government contracts for highways or roads, making sure injured parties have clear rules and protections when seeking compensation.
