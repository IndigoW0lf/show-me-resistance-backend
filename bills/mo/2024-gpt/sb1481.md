summary_short: "Schools must create policies about students' use of cell phones by July 1, 2025."
summary: |
  This bill requires all school districts and charter schools in Missouri to develop and put into writing a policy about how students can possess and use cell phones while on school property or at school events. The policies must be consistent and can include rules about banning or allowing cell phone use during school hours, permitting use only for educational purposes, or designating areas for phone use. Schools can discipline students who violate these rules. The goal is to make clear and fair guidelines regarding students' cell phone use in schools.
