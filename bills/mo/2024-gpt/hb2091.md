summary: |
  This law allows military veterans who served in Operation Enduring Freedom (in Afghanistan) and Operation Iraqi Freedom to apply for dedicated license plates. These plates will display the words "AFGHANISTAN & IRAQ VETERAN" and show medals for both campaigns. Veterans can get these plates for any vehicle they own, with a small fee, and they can obtain multiple sets if needed. The plates help recognize and honor their service and are available to eligible veterans and current service members.
