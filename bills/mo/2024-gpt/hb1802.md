  This legislation revises existing speed limit laws in Missouri to specify maximum speeds on various types of roads, including rural interstates, expressways, freeways, and roads within urban areas. It defines new categories such as expressways and freeways and sets their speed limits at 70, 65, and 60 miles per hour, respectively, with additional rules for roads outside urban areas. The bill also allows city and town governments to set local speed limits on state roads within their borders, with approval, to help manage traffic flow and safety. Overall, it provides clearer guidelines for speed limits and gives local governments more authority to adjust speeds for safety and traffic efficiency.
