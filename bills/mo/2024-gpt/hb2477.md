summary_short: "This bill helps licensed dietitians who move to Missouri, including military spouses, get their license more easily."
summary: |
  The bill allows dietitians who are already licensed in another state, U.S. territory, or military branch and have practiced for at least one year to apply for a Missouri license without retaking exams or fulfilling extra requirements. It especially helps military spouses and active-duty military personnel by letting them quickly get licensed when they move to Missouri or nearby states. This makes it easier for qualified dietitians, including those in the military community, to work in Missouri without unnecessary delays or extra testing.
