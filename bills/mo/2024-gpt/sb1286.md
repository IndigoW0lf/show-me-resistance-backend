summary: |
  This bill updates the rules for retired public school workers in Missouri who are receiving retirement benefits. It allows retirees to work part-time or as temporary substitutes for up to 550 hours during a school year, earning up to 50% of the salary for their position without losing their retirement payments. If retirees work more than these limits, they may lose some or all of their benefits for those months and might have to pay back money earned over the limit. The law also clarifies that this applies to those working for third-party employers or as independent contractors if they perform teaching or education-related work that normally requires certification. Overall, this bill provides more flexibility for retired educators to work part-time while protecting the integrity of retirement benefits.
