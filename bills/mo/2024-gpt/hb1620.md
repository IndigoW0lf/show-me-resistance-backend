summary_short: "This bill allows Missouri's House of Representatives to review and potentially challenge presidential orders they believe are unconstitutional."

summary: |
  The bill gives the Missouri House of Representatives the authority to examine executive orders issued by the President of the United States. If they think an order might violate the Constitution, they can recommend further investigation by the state's attorney general. The bill also states that state agencies, local governments, and officials should not enforce any presidential order that restricts constitutional rights or is found to be unconstitutional, especially in areas like public health emergencies, natural resources, farming, land use, financial regulations, or gun rights. This means the state can oppose certain federal orders that it sees as overstepping or unconstitutional, protecting local interests and rights.
