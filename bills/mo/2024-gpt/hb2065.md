summary: |
  This bill changes the way Missouri counties manage unpaid property taxes. It repeals many existing laws about tax collection and introduces new rules. For example, counties can choose to follow different procedures for collecting overdue taxes after a property has been delinquent for two years. These changes aim to improve the transparency and efficiency of tax collection processes, affecting county tax offices, property owners with unpaid taxes, and local government operations.
