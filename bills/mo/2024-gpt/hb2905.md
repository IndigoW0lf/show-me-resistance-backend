summary_short: "This bill sets up a new, simpler funding model for Missouri's public colleges and universities to ensure stable, fair, and results-focused financial support."
summary: |
  The bill directs the Missouri Department of Higher Education and Workforce Development to create a new funding system for public higher education institutions. This system aims to provide steady and sustainable funding that helps colleges and universities serve students effectively. It uses data and a cost-based approach to calculate funding, while also including measures to improve student success and operational efficiency. The new model will be tested, evaluated, and then approved by the state's higher education authorities before becoming the main way the state funds these institutions starting with the 2027-28 fiscal year. Only if the legislature approves it with a formal resolution will the new funding plan take effect.
