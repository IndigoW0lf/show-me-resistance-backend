summary_short: "This bill requires certain large cities and counties to pay for the housing costs of inmates or detainees from other areas."
summary: |
  The bill applies to specific large urban areas in Missouri, including some counties with populations over 400,000 or 1 million people, and cities not within counties. If these areas house inmates or detainees who are residents of other counties or cities, they will now be responsible for reimbursing those residents' local governments for the daily cost of housing them. This helps ensure that local governments are not unfairly burdened financially when they house people from outside their community.
