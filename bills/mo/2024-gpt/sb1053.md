summary_short: "This bill creates a temporary, nonrenewable license for dietitians in Missouri to practice under supervision without taking exams."
summary: |
  The bill allows individuals who want to become dietitians to obtain a temporary license without needing to pass an exam, as long as they meet certain qualifications and work under the supervision of a licensed dietitian. The supervising dietitian must have at least one year of active practice and cannot be a close family member of the temporary licensee. The temporary license is valid for up to 180 days or until employment ends, whichever happens first. This change is intended to help new dietitians start practicing more easily while still ensuring proper oversight.
