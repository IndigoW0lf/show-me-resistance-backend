summary: |
  This bill, called the "Anti-Red Flag Gun Seizure Act," prevents Missouri state and local agencies from enforcing federal or state laws, orders, or measures that temporarily or permanently confiscate firearms without a court hearing. It defines what a red flag law is and states that any federal or state order requiring the surrender or removal of firearms that bypass legal court processes is considered unconstitutional under Missouri and U.S. constitutional rights. The bill also prohibits any state agency or local law enforcement from receiving federal funds to enforce red flag laws and makes it illegal for them to attempt enforcement. Additionally, law enforcement officers or agencies that knowingly try to enforce such laws could be held liable and face significant civil penalties. The law aims to protect the rights of Missouri citizens to keep and bear arms and due process rights by blocking enforcement of what it considers unconstitutional firearm confiscation orders.
