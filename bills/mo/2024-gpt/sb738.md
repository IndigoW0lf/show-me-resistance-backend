summary: |
  This bill updates the rules for fee offices that handle vehicle titles, registrations, and taxes for the Missouri Department of Revenue. It sets new fees for services like issuing vehicle registrations, titles, and licenses, increasing some fees from the original amounts. The bill also requires the department to choose fee office operators through a competitive bidding process that favors nonprofit organizations and local government groups, with specific eligibility criteria. It prevents awarding contracts to entities affiliated with current or former department employees for one year after employment ends. These changes aim to regulate how fee offices operate, who can operate them, and how they are selected to promote fairness and transparency.
