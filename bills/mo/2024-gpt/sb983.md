  This law changes how health insurance companies handle prior authorization for medical services.

The bill also makes sure doctors are notified of decisions within 25 days and can access all their authorization records online. It aims to reduce unnecessary delays and paperwork, helping healthcare providers and patients get the care they need more quickly.
