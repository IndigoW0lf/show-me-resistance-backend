summary_short: "This bill updates the rules for how and where charter schools can operate and who can sponsor them in Missouri."

summary: |
  This bill changes existing laws about charter schools in Missouri. It clearly states that charter schools are public schools that operate independently. The bill specifies the types of districts where charter schools are allowed, such as urban, large city, or unaccredited districts, and sets new rules for districts with financial struggles or provisional accreditation. It also outlines who is eligible to sponsor charter schools, mainly local school boards and certain administrative boards, and limits the number of students who can attend charter schools in some districts. These changes affect school districts, sponsors, and students interested in attending charter schools.
