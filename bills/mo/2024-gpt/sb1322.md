summary: |
  This bill makes changes to the rules about educational assistance for members of the Missouri National Guard. It allows Guard members to get tuition and fee waivers for undergraduate courses at state-approved colleges if those costs are not covered by federal programs. It also provides grants to eligible private or public colleges for Guard members to help pay for their education. The bill ensures that these benefits are funded annually and sets clear definitions for which schools qualify. Guard members can apply for these benefits before each semester and must meet certain service and academic standards to stay eligible.
