summary: |
  This bill requires each state department in Missouri to track and report how much money they spend on following federal regulations. Starting on September 1, 2024, these departments will send a report every three months to the Department of Economic Development. The department will then share these reports with the state legislature and post them on their website for the public to see. This change makes it easier for everyone to understand the financial impact of federal rules on state agencies and promotes transparency.
