summary: |
  This bill changes existing rules to better promote and support new businesses in Missouri. It requires the state to report annually on contracts awarded to businesses less than three years old, including details about the total number and dollar amounts, as well as how these contracts are distributed among different racial, gender, and veteran-owned businesses. The bill also encourages the state to look for creative ways to help small businesses comply with regulations and recommends ways to improve access to resources for new businesses. These changes aim to make it easier for new, minority, women, and veteran-owned businesses to grow and compete for government contracts.
