summary: |
  HB2522 changes the way "machine gun" and other firearm-related terms are defined in Missouri law to improve clarity. It repeals the old law and replaces it with a new section that clarifies what counts as an antique firearm, a collector's relic, and other weapons or devices like silencers and gas guns. The law affects gun owners, collectors, law enforcement, and retailers by updating the legal language about firearms, especially concerning what constitutes a machine gun and similar weapons.
