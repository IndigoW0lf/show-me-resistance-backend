summary: |
  The bill changes the rules related to solar energy systems owned by individuals or businesses, called "customer-generators," that produce renewable electricity. It creates a new set of standards for how these systems can connect to the grid, including safety and inspection requirements, and clarifies how "net metering" worksâ€”meaning how the electricity these systems generate is measured and credited. These changes are intended to make it easier for people and businesses to install solar panels and receive fair credit for the energy they produce. It affects utility companies, solar system owners, and government regulators in Missouri who oversee electricity and renewable energy policies.
