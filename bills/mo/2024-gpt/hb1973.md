summary_short: "This bill updates the tax credit program for donations to organizations that support children in Missouri."

summary: |
  This bill changes the rules for a tax credit that encourages people and businesses to donate money to groups helping children, such as child advocacy centers, court-appointed support organizations, and emergency care centers. Starting from 2013 up to the end of 2023, individuals can get a tax credit worth up to 50% of their donation. After 2024, the available credit increases to 70%. The total amount of tax credits that can be claimed is capped at specific amounts each year, and the bill ensures that a portion of these credits go to the main types of child-support organizations. This measure aims to promote charitable giving to help children in need and makes it easier for donors to receive some financial relief when they contribute.
