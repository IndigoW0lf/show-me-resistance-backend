summary: |
  This bill proposes to raise the tax on cigarettes from $0.17 to $0.27 for a standard pack of 20 cigarettes. The additional revenue from this tax increase is intended to support public education and healthcare programs in the state. The change is only in effect if voters approve it through a public vote. The bill also details how the cigarette tax stamps will be issued and collected, and it aims to make the tax easier to enforce. This affects cigarette sellers, smokers, and public health initiatives by potentially increasing cigarette prices and generating funds for important community services.
