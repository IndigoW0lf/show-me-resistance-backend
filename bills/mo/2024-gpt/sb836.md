summary: |
  The bill changes the definition of "certified funds" used in real estate closings. It clarifies that certified funds include United States currency, cashier's checks, certified checks, teller's checks, wire transfers, and real-time payment systems like RTP and FedNow, as long as the funds have been unconditionally received and credited to the settlement agentâ€™s account. This affects settlement agents, financial institutions, and real estate professionals by standardizing and expanding what is considered acceptable payment for closing real estate deals. The goal is to improve clarity and security around the handling of funds during property transactions.
