summary: |
  The "Protect Elder Realty for Retirement Years Act" requires that anyone selling a personal home where an elderly person, age 75 or older, is involved must include a 72-hour cooling-off period after signing the sale agreement. During this time, either party can cancel the contract for any reason without facing penalties or legal consequences. The bill also strictly prohibits pressure, intimidation, or undue influence against the elderly person to prevent them from exercising their right to cancel. If a cancellation occurs, the seller must return any payments made within ten days. This law aims to protect older homeowners in real estate transactions and ensure they have a safe period to reconsider agreements.
