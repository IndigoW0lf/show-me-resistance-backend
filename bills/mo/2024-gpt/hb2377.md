summary: |
  This bill mandates that by January 1, 2025, each county in Missouri must establish a notification system. This system will alert people or organizations when a document they are involved in is recorded at the county recorderâ€™s office. Participation in the notification system is voluntary, meaning individuals or entities can opt-in if they want to receive these alerts. Notifications can be sent by email, text message, or similar methods. The goal is to improve transparency and keep interested parties informed about legal or financial documents involving them.
