summary_short: "This bill allows the recorder of deeds or their deputy to perform marriage ceremonies under supervision."

summary: |
  This bill updates Missouri law to let the recorder of deeds, or their deputy, legally perform marriage ceremonies. Previously, marriages could only be solemnized by religious leaders, judges, or religious organizations. Now, the recorder of deeds can also officiate marriages, which means more options for couples to get married in the state. This change makes the process more flexible and accessible, especially for those who may want a civil, non-religious ceremony performed by a government official.
