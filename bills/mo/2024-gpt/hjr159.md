summary_short: "This bill proposes amending Missouri's Constitution to strengthen gun rights while allowing cities and counties to regulate firearms within certain limits."
summary: |
  The bill suggests changing the Missouri Constitution to clearly protect the right of citizens to keep and carry guns, including ammunition and accessories, for home defense, personal safety, and in support of civil authority. It ensures these rights are considered unchangeable and requires strict review of any restrictions. However, it also allows cities like St. Louis and Kansas City to create local laws to regulate firearm possession, such as issuing permits, setting fees, and establishing penalties, with certain exemptions for law enforcement, judges, military, and security personnel.
