summary: |
  This bill revises the laws regarding the minimum school term for public schools in Missouri. It specifies that before July 1, 2025, schools must have either at least 174 days with a five-day week or 142 days with a four-day week, or a total of 1,044 hours of student attendance each year. Starting with the 2019-20 school year, only attendance hours are required, with no set number of days. From the 2025-26 school year onward, schools must ensure at least 1,044 hours of instruction each year. This change affects school districts, teachers, students, and parents by adjusting how school time is counted and planned.
