summary_short: "This bill updates how boats and certain other personal property are assessed for property taxes in Missouri."
summary: |
  The bill changes the rules for how boats and related personal property are taxed. It specifies that boats, houseboats, floating docks, and manufactured homes used for lodging are taxed in the county where these items are located, rather than the owner’s home county. For boats stored outside the owner’s county and not regularly moved there, taxes are based on where they are kept. Additionally, property belonging to estates is taxed in the county with court jurisdiction, and farm-related property used exclusively on farms is not taxed by cities unless the farm is within city limits. The bill aims to clarify assessment locations and ensure fair taxation for boat owners and other property owners across Missouri.
