summary_short: "Legislators must report to the Missouri ethics commission if they file bills that will benefit their employer."
summary: |
  This new law requires members of the Missouri General Assembly to disclose to the Missouri ethics commission when they introduce legislation that would directly benefit their employer. They must do this within 15 days of filing the bill. The ethics commission will create a system to help enforce this rule and may set additional regulations. The goal is transparency, making it clear when lawmakers are proposing laws that could favor their own relationships with employers.
