summary_short: "This bill makes the Missouri State Board of Education the final authority for handling appeals of decisions made by statewide school activity organizations."
summary: |
  The bill states that any statewide organization that organizes interscholastic activities for secondary students—especially those involving public schools—cannot be the body to decide appeals about their own rulings. Instead, the Missouri State Board of Education will now handle these appeals. When an appeal is made, the Board has 48 hours to schedule a meeting, and it must decide on the appeal within 24 hours after that meeting. This change aims to provide a more neutral and consistent process for resolving disputes involving school activities.
