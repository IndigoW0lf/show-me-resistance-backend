summary_short: "This bill updates the rules for virtual school programs and student enrollment in Missouri."
summary: |
  The bill explains how Missouri's Virtual School Program works, including who can participateâ€”students under 21 in kindergarten through 12th grade living in the state. It clarifies how students in virtual programs are counted for school funding and how their attendance is reported. Schools and the state will use this information to plan budgets and ensure funding follows students enrolled in virtual learning. It also requires the program to share student information with local districts to keep track of students and their needs.
