summary_short: "This bill updates how Missouri distributes funds to regional planning groups, including funding limits and matching requirements."

summary: |
  The bill changes the rules for providing state funds to regional planning commissions across Missouri. It requires that local communities match half of the funds they receive from the state, meaning they must contribute their own money to get the funding. It also sets specific maximum amounts the state will provide to each regional group, with some totals capped at certain numbers and periodic adjustments for inflation starting in July 2025. This impacts local governments and regional planning agencies by guiding how much grant money they can receive and ensuring local contributions are part of the funding process.
