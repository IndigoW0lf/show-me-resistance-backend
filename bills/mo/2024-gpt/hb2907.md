summary_short: "This bill updates Missouri's laws on self-defense, explaining when you can use force to protect yourself or others without facing legal issues."
summary: |
  The bill modifies the state's self-defense laws by clarifying when a person is justified in using physical force or even deadly force to protect themselves, others, or property. It states that you can use force if you reasonably believe it is necessary to prevent harm from unlawful actions by someone else. The law also details situations where deadly force is justified, such as protecting against serious injury or death, or when unlawful entry occurs into a personâ€™s home or property. Additionally, it removes the duty to retreat in certain cases and explains that someone claiming self-defense has the responsibility to prove their actions were justified in court. These changes are designed to better define when force is justified and who it applies to.
