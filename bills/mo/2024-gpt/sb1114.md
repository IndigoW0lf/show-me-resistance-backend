summary_short: "This bill limits the liability of transportation network companies (TNCs) for injuries or damages caused by drivers using their platform, under certain conditions."

summary: |
  This law states that transportation network companies, like ride-sharing firms, cannot be held responsible for harm caused by their drivers' vehicles if specific conditions are met. Specifically, if the company is not negligent or involved in criminal activity, and has properly fulfilled its responsibilities toward the driver, it won't be legally liable for accidents or damages resulting from the driver's use of the vehicle while logged into the company's digital network. This aims to clarify the company's legal responsibilities and protect them from certain lawsuits, provided they follow the rules and do not act negligently.
