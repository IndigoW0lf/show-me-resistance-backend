summary: |
  The bill changes Missouri laws to restrict how much agricultural land can be owned by foreigners or foreign businesses. Starting August 28, 2024, no new foreign ownership of agricultural land will be allowed, and any current foreign owners must sell their land by August 28, 2029. The purpose is to ensure that foreign entities do not hold more than 1% of the state's agricultural land and to promote local control. It affects anyone or any business outside the U.S. that owns or plans to buy farmland in Missouri.
