summary: |
  This bill updates the rules for shutting down a public water district in Missouri. To dissolve a district, residents must file a petition that describes the district and explains why dissolution is in the public's best interest. The petition must also include a plan for paying off any debts. Once filed, the court will set a hearing, and notice of this hearing will be published in local newspapers. The process ensures that community members are involved and that the districtâ€™s debts and responsibilities are properly handled before it is dissolved. This bill affects district residents, water district officials, and the courts involved in such proceedings.
