summary_short: "A proposed constitutional amendment to strengthen gun rights, specify regulations on firearm transfers, and allow local firearm regulations with community approval."
summary: |
  This bill proposes amending Missouri's Constitution to affirm that every citizen has the unalienable right to keep and bear arms for self-defense, property protection, or when called to aid law enforcement. It also sets rules for firearm transfers, requiring background checks through licensed dealers, but allowing transfers if checks are delayed or if the recipient is cleared. Additionally, it gives local communities the authority to pass laws about firearm sale, possession, and use if residents approve. The bill aims to protect gun rights more strongly while allowing some local regulation, affecting gun owners, local governments, and law enforcement.
