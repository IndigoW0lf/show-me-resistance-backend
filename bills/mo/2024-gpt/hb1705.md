summary_short: "This bill updates rules for small renewable energy systems that generate their own power and can send excess electricity back to the grid."

summary: |
  The bill, called the "Net Metering and Easy Connection Act," changes how electricity from small renewable energy systems—like solar panels or wind turbines—can be put onto the electric grid. It sets standards for customer-generators, who own these systems, including capacity limits, safety, and interconnection requirements. The bill makes it easier for people and organizations to connect their renewable energy systems to the grid and receive credit for the excess electricity they produce. It applies to electric utilities, cooperatives, and other energy providers, helping promote cleaner energy sources for consumers and local communities.
