summary: |
  This bill establishes the "Missouri Teachers Classroom Supply Assistance Program" to help teachers buy supplies for their students. Starting in the 2025-26 school year, the Department of Elementary and Secondary Education will give each school district and charter school funds based on student attendance. Each school will then give teachers a debit card with money allocated for classroom supplies, which teachers can use to purchase materials for their students. Teachers will need to keep receipts and follow rules for proper use. Any leftover money will stay in the program for future years. The goal is to support teachers and improve classroom resources across Missouri.
