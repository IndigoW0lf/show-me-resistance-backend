summary: |
  The bill proposes to amend Missouri's Constitution to specify that only U.S. citizens who are residents of the state and the local area where they want to vote will be able to participate in elections. It clarifies that voters must be over 18 and meet residency and registration requirements, whether or not registration is needed for the election. The bill also excludes people with guardianship due to mental incapacity, those involuntarily confined in mental institutions, and individuals convicted of certain crimes from voting. These changes aim to update and clarify voter eligibility rules in Missouri.
