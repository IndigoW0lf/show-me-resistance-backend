summary_short: "This bill updates how Missouri reports and tracks property tax exemptions and abatement information every two years."

summary: |
  The bill changes the rules for reporting property tax exemptions in Missouri. It requires county assessors to identify and list properties that are partially or fully exempt from property taxes, including their value and remaining exemption years, and submit this information every odd-numbered year starting from 1989. Additionally, it updates the annual reporting process of the state tax commission, including information about tax-exempt properties, and requires that summary data be included with reassessment notices. These changes aim to make property tax exemption data more transparent and accessible to the public.
