summary_short: "This bill changes rules about city property condemnation, allowing cities to take land with some exceptions related to religious organizations."
summary: |
  The bill modifies existing laws to specify that cities can condemn (take) land for public use, but they cannot do so for properties owned by religious organizations like churches, mosques, or synagogues that are tax-exempt under federal law. When cities condemn land, they can pay for it using city funds without needing property owners to pay assessments based on benefits, or they can pay damages upfront and collect costs later. This change mostly affects religious organizations that own property and are protected from condemnation under this law, meaning they cannot be targeted for land seizure in the same way as other properties.
