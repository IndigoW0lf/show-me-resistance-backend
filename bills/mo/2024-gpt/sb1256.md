summary_short: "This bill sets rules for how public school students are addressed, requiring permissions from parents for names and pronouns."
summary: |
  The Given Name Act is a new law that says public schools and their staff must use the name and pronouns provided by a student's parents when referring to the student. Staff cannot use other names or pronouns without the parents' written permission. The law also protects teachers and staff from being forced to use pronouns that conflict with their religious or moral beliefs. Parents can take legal action if their child's rights are violated. The goal is to ensure respect for parental authority and personal beliefs in schools regarding students' names and gender references.
