summary_short: "This bill requires hospitals and first responders to receive training on recognizing and reporting human trafficking."

summary: |
  This bill mandates that hospitals and first responder agencies in Missouri provide training on human trafficking awareness. Hospitals must offer at least 20 minutes of training to their employees before January 1, 2026, and then every two years after that. Similarly, first responder agencies, such as police, firefighters, and emergency medical staff, must also complete similar training by that date and on a biennial basis. The training covers topics like how to identify trafficking victims, the differences between labor and sex trafficking, and how to report concerns. The goal is to help these groups detect and respond to human trafficking more effectively, protecting victims and supporting law enforcement efforts.
