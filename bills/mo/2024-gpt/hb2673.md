  This bill makes changes to the laws governing public higher education in Missouri. It clarifies the authority of the state's universities and colleges to award various degrees, including the types of degrees that only the University of Missouri can grant, such as research doctorates and professional degrees like medicine and law. Additionally, the bill creates a new "Department of Higher Education and Workforce Development" and dissolves existing education agencies, transferring their responsibilities to a new "Coordinating Board for Higher Education." These reforms aim to improve the management and regulation of public higher education institutions in Missouri and affect university administrators, policymakers, and students.
