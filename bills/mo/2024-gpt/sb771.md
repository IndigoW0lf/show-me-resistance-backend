summary: |
  This bill changes the stateâ€™s laws regarding self-defense and the use of force. It states that people have the right to use physical force, including deadly force in certain situations, to defend themselves or others from harm, as long as their actions are reasonable. The bill also explains when a person is considered the initial aggressor and how their actions affect their right to claim self-defense. Additionally, it removes the duty to retreat in some circumstances and clarifies rules for law enforcement and private property owners. These changes aim to make self-defense laws clearer and more predictable for everyone in Missouri.
