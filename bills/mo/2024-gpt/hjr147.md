summary: |
  This bill proposes a change to Missouri's Constitution that would reaffirm the right of citizens to keep and bear arms, while allowing certain restrictions, such as limiting gun access for convicted felons or individuals deemed a danger to themselves or others. It also gives cities and counties the power to regulate firearms within their limits through local laws, including issuing permits and setting penalties for violations. The amendment aims to balance individual gun rights with local regulation authority and specific restrictions for certain groups.
