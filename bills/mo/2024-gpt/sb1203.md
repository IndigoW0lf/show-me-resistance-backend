summary_short: "This law requires Missouri public schools to publish information about their training and curriculum related to diversity, inclusion, race, ethnicity, sex, and bias on their websites."

summary: |
  The bill SB1203 ensures that all public school districts and charter schools in Missouri share details about their staff training and teaching materials that deal with topics like diversity, equity, inclusion, race, ethnicity, sex, and bias. These schools must make this information easy to find on their websites, including summaries, links if available online, and details about who created the materials. The goal is to make sure parents and the community can see what kind of training and lessons students are receiving in these areas. This information must be posted before such training begins or within a week afterward and kept online for at least two years. Schools or legal authorities can face legal action if they do not follow these transparency rules. The law aims to increase accountability and transparency in how schools handle sensitive social topics.
