summary_short: "This bill allows school districts to remove certain properties from tax increment financing districts to help improve local communities."
summary: |
  The bill changes the rules around how certain areas in Missouri are managed for tax purposes. Specifically, it lets school districts remove some property from a special type of zone called a "tax increment financing" district. These districts are used to encourage development by reinvesting property tax revenue. Removing properties may help promote more balanced community growth and improve areas that are not yet considered blighted but might become problems in the future. The bill impacts school districts, local governments, property owners, and developers by giving them more flexibility in managing these districts for community development.
