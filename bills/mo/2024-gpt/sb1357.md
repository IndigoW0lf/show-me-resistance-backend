summary: |
  This bill creates a new Pregnancy-Associated Mortality Review Board within the Missouri Department of Health and Senior Services. The board will include diverse members from medical, public health, and community backgrounds and will meet at least twice a year. Its job is to review all maternal deaths—any death of a woman while pregnant or within a year of pregnancy—analyze causes, and make recommendations to reduce future maternal mortality. The goal is to improve data collection, identify preventable factors, and share findings with health professionals, policymakers, and the public to improve maternal health across the state.
