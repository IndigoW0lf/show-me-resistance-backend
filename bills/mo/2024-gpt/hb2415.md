summary: |
  This law requires Missouri's in-state public colleges and universities to grant college course credit to students who earn a score of 4 or higher on international baccalaureate (IB) exams. When students apply to these schools, the schools must have a policy in place that clearly explains how college credit will be awarded based on IB exam scores. This helps students save time and money by potentially earning college credit before starting college courses.
