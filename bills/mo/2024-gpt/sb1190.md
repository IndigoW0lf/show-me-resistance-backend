summary: |
  This bill makes sure that when you pay for medications or other health services, any amount paid—whether by you or on your behalf—counts toward your total costs and limits for out-of-pocket expenses. It applies to health insurance plans in Missouri and covers all types of health care services and medications that don't have a generic substitute. The bill also clarifies how these payments are counted for people with high-deductible health plans that are compatible with health savings accounts, with certain exemptions for preventive care. Overall, it helps ensure that all payments towards your health costs are fully counted, making it easier to track your expenses and reach your coverage limits.
