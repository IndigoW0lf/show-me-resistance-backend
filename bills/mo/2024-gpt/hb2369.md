summary: |
  The bill requires medical malpractice insurance providers to cover healthcare professionals involved in abortion services, meaning they cannot be denied insurance solely because they provide or assist with abortions. It also clarifies what constitutes an abortion and sets insurance coverage minimums for doctors performing these procedures. This helps ensure that providers offering abortion care have access to necessary liability coverage, promoting continued access to reproductive health services for patients.
