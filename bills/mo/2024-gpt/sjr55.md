summary_short: "This bill requires all county assessors in Missouri's charter counties to be elected officials."

summary: |
  This legislation proposes an amendment to the Missouri Constitution that, if approved by voters, will ensure that the assessor position in charter counties is filled through elections. Currently, some counties may have appointed assessors, but this bill mandates that assessors must be elected by the people. This change affects county government officials responsible for property assessments and impacts voters in those counties, making the assessor position more accountable to the public.
