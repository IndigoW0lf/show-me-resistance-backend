summary: |
  The bill, called "Hannah's Law," updates the rules for safety around water. It states that all children under 13 must wear a U.S. Coast Guard-approved life jacket when they are on a boat or swimming in waters deeper than three feet. If a parent or guardian allows a child to be in these situations without a life jacket, they could face a minor legal penalty. The rule does not apply if the child is in a fully enclosed part of a boat or is being supervised by a lifeguard. This law aims to keep kids safer when they are near or in the water.
