summary_short: "This bill urges Missouri to stop using taxpayer money to fund anti-abortion marketing and instead invest in providing confidential, evidence-based reproductive health care for all residents."

summary: |
  This bill requests the Missouri government to end contracts with Choose Life Marketing, a company that uses targeted advertising to direct pregnant people away from legitimate healthcare providers like clinics and toward anti-abortion centers. It highlights concerns that these centers often provide misleading or medically inaccurate information, lack qualified medical staff, and may misuse personal health data. The bill emphasizes that public funds should not support efforts that mislead or harm pregnant individuals, and it encourages reallocating resources to ensure access to safe, confidential, and comprehensive reproductive health services for everyone in Missouri.
