summary_short: "This bill clarifies when permits are needed for land excavation activities related to construction and land improvement in Missouri."
summary: |
  The bill updates Missouri law to specify that certain types of land excavation for construction and land improvement do not require surface mining permits. Specifically, excavations for construction based on professional plans or contracts, and excavations for land improvements using excess fill dirt or minerals that are not used commercially, are generally exempt from permit requirements. It also ensures that moving fill dirt within a property doesn't automatically trigger permit rules. If there's any question about whether a permit is needed, authorities can review the case and provide a written decision, with a process for appealing if necessary. This bill affects property owners, construction companies, and land developers by simplifying the process for some excavation activities.
