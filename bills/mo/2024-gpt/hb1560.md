summary: |
  This new law stops people receiving temporary assistance for needy families (TANF) from using their benefit cards at ATMs to get cash or at places like liquor stores, casinos, or establishments that offer adult entertainment. It also restricts what items can be purchased with TANF benefits, ensuring they are used only for necessary needs. If someone uses their benefits in a prohibited way, they must repay the department and could lose their benefits for a periodâ€”up to five years after repeated violations. The bill also makes it illegal for stores and businesses to accept TANF or SNAP benefits at prohibited locations or for forbidden purchases. This law aims to ensure public funds are used appropriately and helps to prevent the misuse of government assistance.
