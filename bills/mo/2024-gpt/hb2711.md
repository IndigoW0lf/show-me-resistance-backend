summary_short: "This bill creates a state fund to support investigations into radioactive waste concerns in Missouri."
summary: |
  The bill sets up a special fund in the state treasury called the Radioactive Waste Investigation Fund, which is used by the Department of Natural Resources to study potential radioactive contamination in specific areas. Local government bodies can submit requests for investigations, and the department will use sound scientific methods to examine those areas, especially focusing on sites near federal radioactive sites. The investigation results will be shared with the public and relevant authorities within 45 days. The bill also limits the annual spending on these investigations and ensures the state can recover costs from federal agencies responsible for cleanup efforts.
