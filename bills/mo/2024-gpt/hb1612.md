summary_short: "This bill allows counties in Missouri to create regional jail districts with voter approval to expand jail facilities and improve management."
summary: |
  The bill makes it possible for two or more neighboring counties in Missouri to work together and form a regional jail district. Before doing so, each county must approve the agreement and, if applicable, voters in the new joining county must also approve a sales tax linked to the district. The bill specifies how these districts can be formed, how they will be funded, and how they will operate, including managing jail facilities and handling prisoners. This legislation affects local government officials, residents of the counties involved, and anyone working in or with the criminal justice system, aiming to improve jail capacity and management in a collaborative way.
