summary_short: "All local tax increase votes must be held on a general or primary election day starting August 28, 2024."
summary: |
  This law requires that any proposals to create, renew, or increase local taxes, fees, or licenses be voted on during scheduled general or primary elections. This change takes effect after August 28, 2024. The goal is to make sure these important tax decisions are decided by voters during major election days, rather than at less prominent times throughout the year. It affects local government bodies responsible for proposing tax increases and the voters who will approve or reject these proposals.
