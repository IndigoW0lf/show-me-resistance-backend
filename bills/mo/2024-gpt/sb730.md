summary: |
  This bill establishes the "Community Crime Reduction Grant Program" to provide financial support to municipal police departments in Missouri. The program offers grants to help cover the costs of hiring additional officers and funding training related to fair policing and racial sensitivity. Police departments that receive grants must report annually on how the money was used, how many officers were hired, and any improvements in local crime rates. The funds come from a special state account and are intended to support efforts to reduce crime and strengthen community trust. This bill primarily affects police departments, local governments, and communities in Missouri.
