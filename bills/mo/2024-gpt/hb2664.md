summary: |
  The "End Hospital Institutionalization Act" stops hospitals from keeping patients who are medically stable for reasons like caretakers not being able or willing to manage their care outside the hospital. It requires hospitals to notify juvenile courts or mental health departments when children or individuals with mental health, developmental, or substance use issues are being kept in the hospital without a medical need. Once notified, these authorities must step in quickly to ensure the patients are placed in appropriate care settings and receive proper treatment. The law also requires the state to reimburse hospitals for the costs of caring for these patients during their extended stays. This bill helps protect patients from unnecessary hospital stays and makes sure they get the right care in the right place.
