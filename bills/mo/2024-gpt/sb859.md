summary: |
  This bill revises the state's laws about first-degree murder, defining the crime as causing a person's death with prior planning. It increases penalties for those over 18, allowing for either the death penalty or life imprisonment without parole, except in cases where the offender had a serious mental illness at the time of the crime. The bill identifies specific mental health conditions that can make someone ineligible for the death penalty and explains how mental illness can be proven, even if diagnosed after the crime. It aims to ensure that mental health issues are properly considered in serious murder cases and affects prosecutors, defendants, and mental health professionals.
