summary_short: "This bill makes it easier for eligible individuals to be discharged early from probation in Missouri."

summary: |
  The bill updates Missouri laws about probation, allowing certain people to be discharged early if they have completed at least 24 months of good behavior and are in compliance with their probation conditions. The Division of Probation and Parole will notify the court when someone qualifies for discharge. The prosecutor can request a hearing if they oppose the discharge, and the court will decide whether the person can be released early based on evidence. This change aims to motivate good conduct during probation and gives courts a fair process to discharge eligible individuals sooner, benefiting those who follow the rules while still maintaining oversight for those with serious charges or unmet obligations.
