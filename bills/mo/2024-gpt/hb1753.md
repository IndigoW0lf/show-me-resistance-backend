summary_short: "This bill requires utility companies in Missouri to replace any closed large power plants with an equal or greater amount of reliable electric power to ensure ongoing energy supply."

summary: |
  The bill sets new rules for closing big electricity plants in Missouri. If a utility company wants to shut down a power plant that produces over 100 megawatts, they must first secure enough new reliable power sources to replace it, ensuring there is no loss of energy for customers. These new sources can be built in or outside the state and must be fully operational before the old plant closes. The goal is to maintain a steady and reliable electricity supply for residents and businesses, and the bill applies to utility companies operating in Missouri. It also emphasizes quick action to protect public safety and energy availability.
