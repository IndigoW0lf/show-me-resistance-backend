summary_short: "This bill updates rules for fire protection district board member qualifications, elections, and restrictions on enforcing residential construction regulations."
summary: |
  This bill makes several changes to how fire protection districts in Missouri operate. It sets new qualifications for board members, including residency, voter status, age, and how to file to run for a position. It also specifies that elections for board members will be held every two years in April. Additionally, the bill restricts fire districts from enforcing residential construction rules if those rules are adopted by local cities or counties, clarifying which government entities have authority over residential building regulations. These changes aim to improve governance transparency and clarify jurisdiction boundaries affecting residents, local governments, and fire districts.
