summary_short: "This bill proposes a constitutional change to protect gun rights in Missouri and allows cities and counties to regulate firearm possession and permits."
summary: |
  The bill aims to amend Missouri's constitution to explicitly affirm that citizens have the right to keep and bear arms for self-defense, property protection, and law enforcement support. It states that these rights are unchangeable and any restrictions must meet strict legal standards. The bill also gives cities like St. Louis and Kansas City the authority to create their own laws to regulate firearms, including issuing permits, collecting fees, and setting penalties for violations. These local regulations can apply to residents and non-residents, but permits from the holderâ€™s home county are recognized. The goal is to strengthen gun rights while allowing local governments some control over firearm regulation within the limits of the law.
