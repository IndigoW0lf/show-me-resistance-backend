summary: |
  This bill updates existing rules to continue allowing taxpayers in Missouri to receive a tax credit when they donate money or property to diaper banks, which provide diapers and hygiene products for infants, children, or adults in need. The credit is equal to 50% of the donation amount, up to $50,000 per year, and requires a minimum donation of $100. The law clarifies how diaper banks are recognized and how taxpayers can verify their contributions. It aims to encourage more donations to diaper banks by offering financial incentives and ensures the program stays in effect for future years.
