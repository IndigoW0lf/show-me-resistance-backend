summary_short: "This bill creates a program to divert certain offenders with DWI charges into a supervised program instead of automatic punishment, requiring ignition interlock devices."
summary: |
  This law allows a judge in Missouri to send a person charged with a DWI (driving while intoxicated) into a special diversion program if they meet certain conditions. If eligible, the person can avoid traditional prosecution and be part of a program that includes installing an ignition interlock device in their vehicle, which prevents them from driving if they are intoxicated. The program lasts up to two years and is designed to give offenders a chance to address their behavior responsibly. It primarily affects first-time DWI offenders who donâ€™t have a history of high blood alcohol content or recent diversion program participation, and it applies to those who are not commercial drivers.
