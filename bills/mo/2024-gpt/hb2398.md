summary_short: "The bill requires all public and charter schools in Missouri to have safety assessments to identify vulnerabilities and improve security measures."
summary: |
  This bill mandates that the Missouri Department of Elementary and Secondary Education, with help from the Department of Public Safety, conduct safety reviews of every public and charter school in the state. These assessments will look at how secure each school is, including how well they prevent unauthorized access, monitor their buildings, handle visitors, and respond to emergencies. Schools will receive reports with their safety strengths and areas for improvement, along with recommendations to make them safer. The goal is to help schools identify potential risks and improve safety measures, but schools still need to follow existing safety laws and standards.
