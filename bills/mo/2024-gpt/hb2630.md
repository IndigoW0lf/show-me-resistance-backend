summary_short: "This bill updates Missouri's school policies on discipline and bad behavior reporting, including violence and crimes."
summary: |
  The bill changes the rules for how schools handle student discipline and violence. It requires school districts to have a clear written discipline policy, including rules about corporal punishment, and to share this policy with students and parents at the start of each year. Schools must also report serious acts of violence, like assault or weapon use, to the right authorities and law enforcement soon after they happen. These changes help make schools safer by promoting transparency and quick reporting of dangerous behavior. The bill affects school districts, students, parents, teachers, and law enforcement agencies.
