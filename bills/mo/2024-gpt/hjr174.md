summary_short: "This bill proposes a constitutional change in Missouri to clarify and strengthen gun rights while allowing local governments to regulate firearm possession."
summary: |
  The bill aims to amend Missouriâ€™s Constitution by replacing the current gun rights section with a new one that affirms citizens' rights to keep and bear arms for self-defense, property protection, and in aid of civil authorities. It emphasizes that these rights are unalienable and that any restrictions must undergo strict scrutiny, although it allows restrictions for convicted violent felons or individuals deemed a danger due to mental health issues. Additionally, it grants cities like St. Louis and Kansas City the authority to regulate firearms through local ordinances, including issuing permits, charging fees, and setting penalties. These local regulations can recognize permits from other areas and exempt certain professionals such as law enforcement, judges, security personnel, and active military members. This proposed change impacts firearm owners, law enforcement agencies, local governments, and judicial systems across Missouri.
