summary: |
  This bill makes changes to laws about paying for prescription drugs. It guarantees that patients can choose any licensed pharmacist or pharmacy to fill their prescriptions. Pharmacies can give advice about medication safety, and patients can get prescriptions in writing or electronically from their prescriber. The bill also prohibits pharmacy benefit managers from requiring patients to pay more than their planâ€™s copay or cash price when filling a prescription. Additionally, pharmacies and pharmacists can inform patients about the costs of their medications and alternatives without interference from benefit managers. Overall, it aims to give patients more control, clearer information, and better access to prescription services.
