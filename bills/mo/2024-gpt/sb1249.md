summary_short: "This law prevents health insurance companies from charging fees to health care providers when they are reimbursed for services."
summary: |
  This bill makes it illegal for health insurance companies or similar organizations to require health care providers to pay additional fees or charges to get paid for their services. It ensures that providers are paid without having to give up part of their reimbursement as a fee or discount. The bill also requires insurance companies to notify providers if they switch to a new reimbursement method that involves fees, and to give clear instructions on how providers can choose an alternative payment option, including electronic funds transfer. This helps protect health care providers from hidden or unfair charges and promotes transparent and straightforward payment practices.
