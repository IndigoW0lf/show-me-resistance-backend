summary: |
  This bill, called the "Do No Harm Act," amends existing laws to create specific rules around diversity, equity, and inclusion (DEI) programs in medical education. It defines key terms related to student achievement, DEI offices, and DEI officers, and restricts how DEI-related activities can be implemented. For example, it limits the promotion of policies that treat people differently based on race or ethnicity, and clarifies who can hold DEI roles. The bill affects medical schools, faculty, students, and DEI staff by ensuring that DEI efforts do not promote discrimination or biased ideology.
