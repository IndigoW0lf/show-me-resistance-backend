  This bill increases the minimum pay for support care staff working at Missouri Veterans' Homes to be at least $15 per hour, with a maximum of $22 per hour, starting January 1, 2025. If any worker was already earning more than $22 per hour before that date, they will keep their current wage. The law also states that these wages will be adjusted every year based on changes in the Consumer Price Index, helping ensure wages keep pace with inflation. This change affects employees in support care roles at the veterans' homes, aiming to improve wages and support staffing at these facilities.
