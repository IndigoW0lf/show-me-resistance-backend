summary: |
  This bill updates the rules for the Fast Track Workforce Incentive Grant, a program that helps Missouri residents pay for postsecondary education. Starting January 1, 2025, the maximum gross income in order to qualify will increase to $100,000 for married couples and $50,000 for individuals. It aims to support more people, especially those pursuing training or apprenticeships in high-demand fields, by making them eligible for financial grants regardless of higher income levels. The bill also clarifies who qualifies, including apprenticeship status, residency, income limits, and age requirements, so more residents can access this support to further their careers.
