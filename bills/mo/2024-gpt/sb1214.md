summary_short: "This bill removes vehicle weight restrictions for claiming a partial motor fuel tax refund in Missouri."

summary: |
  The bill changes the rules for claiming refunds on motor fuel taxes in Missouri. Previously, only vehicles weighing 26,000 pounds or less could qualify for a refund. Now, that weight limit is gone, allowing more vehicle owners to apply for a refund of fuel taxes they have paid. If you own a vehicle and buy fuel for it, you may be able to get some of the fuel tax money back through this refund process, as long as you follow the new rules and file paperwork on time.
