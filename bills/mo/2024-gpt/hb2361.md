summary_short: "This bill updates environmental regulations related to air quality standards and establishes a new water quality agency in Missouri."
summary: |
  This bill modifies existing rules for the Missouri Air Conservation Commission, giving it the authority to create standards that ensure the state complies with federal Clean Air Act requirements. It also allows the commission to grant exceptions or variances to these rules under specific conditions, such as economic hardship or impracticality. Additionally, the bill prevents the state from regulating residential wood burning appliances unless specifically authorized by the legislature, and it protects the rights of current wood burning devices existing before August 28, 2014. Furthermore, it establishes a new Water Contaminant Control Agency called the "Clean Water Commission of Missouri" to oversee water quality concerns. These changes impact environmental regulators, industries affected by air and water standards, and residents using wood-burning appliances.
