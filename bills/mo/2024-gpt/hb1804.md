summary: |
  This bill repeals an existing law about charges for construction costs and replaces it with new rules. It specifically encourages the construction of small, new nuclear power plants as a form of clean energy in Missouri. The bill sets guidelines for how electrical companies can include the costs of building these plants in their rates, as long as the plants are under 600 megawatts and are built after August 28, 2024. It also requires utilities to submit plans and cost details before starting construction and gives the Missouri Public Service Commission the authority to create rules to oversee this process. Overall, the bill aims to promote the development of clean, nuclear energy in the state while protecting consumers from unfair charges.
