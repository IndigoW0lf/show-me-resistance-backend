summary: |
  The bill aims to add a new section to Missouri's Constitution that recognizes an individualâ€™s right to save seeds, grow food, and harvest produce using traditional methods for their own health and nourishment. It also clarifies that people can sell or donate any surplus food without liability, as long as they do not harm private property or resources. This change would give residents more freedom to produce and share food while respecting property rights. It affects all Missouri residents who grow or handle food, encouraging local food production and community sharing.
