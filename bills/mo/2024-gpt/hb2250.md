summary_short: "This bill requires high school career and technical education programs to include courses that prepare students for insurance licensing and certifications."

summary: |
  This bill ensures that in addition to regular high school coursework, students will have the opportunity to take technical classes that help them prepare for insurance licensing and certification exams. It requires the state to create a plan for career and technical education (CTE) that stays relevant and meets workforce needs. Schools will be responsible for offering courses that align with industry standards, and students can earn certifications in insurance or similar fields. The goal is to better prepare students for entry-level jobs or further training in technical industries, while allowing local districts to tailor their programs based on student interests and local needs.
