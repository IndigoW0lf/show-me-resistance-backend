summary: |
  The bill updates Missouri's minimum wage laws to gradually increase the lowest amount employers must pay their employees. Starting at $8.60 an hour in 2019, the minimum wage will go up by $0.85 each year until it reaches $12 in 2023. From 2025, the wage will increase to $13.75, and then to $15 in 2026. After that, the minimum wage will be adjusted each year based on the cost of living. The law applies to most private employers but not to public employers like government agencies or public schools.
