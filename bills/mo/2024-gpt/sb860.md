summary_short: "This bill allows people who were wrongly convicted of a crime in Missouri and later proven to be innocent to receive restitution payments from the state."

summary: |
  This legislation changes the rules for paying individuals who were wrongly convicted of felonies in Missouri. If someone was found guilty but later proven truly innocent, especially through DNA or other evidence, they can file a request with the court to receive compensation for the time they spent in prison after their conviction. The payment is based on a set amount per day of wrongful incarceration. The bill also specifies the conditions under which a person qualifies, such as exhausting all appeals and proving innocence through testing. It aims to help compensate those who suffered wrongful imprisonment and limits their ability to seek further legal redress against the state. Funds for these payments will be allocated by the Department of Corrections, and payments will be made gradually until fully paid, depending on available funding.
