summary_short: "This bill requires child care providers to have liability insurance and prevention policies for child sexual abuse, and modifies laws about civil actions related to such abuse."

summary: |
  This bill sets new requirements for child care providers in Missouri. If a provider cares for children overnight, they must have liability insurance of at least one million dollars that covers injuries, mental harm, death, and any claims of assault or abuse, without reducing the coverage limits. They also need to have a prevention policy that includes annual training for staff on recognizing and reporting sexual abuse, procedures for investigating abuse allegations, and protocols for separating children from anyone suspected of abuse. Additionally, the bill changes laws about legal actions related to childhood sexual abuse, clarifying who can be sued and under what circumstances. These new rules aim to better protect children and ensure providers are prepared to prevent and respond to abuse.
