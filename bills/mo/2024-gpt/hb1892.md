summary: |
  This bill creates a new pilot program within the Missouri Department of Mental Health to offer dyadic therapy, a treatment that helps both young children under seven and their caregivers at the same time. The program provides screenings, referrals, and therapy services for children and caregivers dealing with attachment issues or behavioral problems. It is available to families where either the child or caregiver is eligible for Medicaid or if the child is in state custody. The goal is to improve children's emotional and behavioral health by supporting strong, healthy relationships within families. Funding for the program will come from a dedicated state fund, and the department will report annually on its progress. The program aims to benefit young children and their families, especially those facing mental health challenges.
