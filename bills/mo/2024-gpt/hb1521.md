summary: |
  The "Defend the Guard Act" is a new law that supports Missouri National Guard members by ensuring they are only deployed into active combat if the U.S. Congress officially declares war. Currently, the Guard can be sent into dangerous situations without such a declaration, but this bill aims to limit that, protecting service members from being deployed in conflict unless Congress formally authorizes it. The law does not affect other types of deployment approved by the governor under different legal provisions. It primarily affects Missouri National Guard soldiers and the state's ability to participate in combat missions, emphasizing that any deployment into combat must follow federal legal procedures.
