summary: |
  This bill, passed in Missouri, makes it illegal for local governments (such as cities or counties) to require homeowners to get a home inspection before they sell their property. However, it does not remove inspection requirements for new construction or when opening a new business or occupancy permit. This change aims to reduce unnecessary barriers and costs for people selling their homes, making the selling process easier and more straightforward.
