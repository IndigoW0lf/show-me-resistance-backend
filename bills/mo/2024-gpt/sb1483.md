summary_short: "This bill reorganizes and updates how the state's Natural Resources Protection Fund is managed and funded to support environmental protection efforts."
summary: |
  This bill repeals existing laws and creates new provisions related to the management of funds used for protecting Missouri's air, water, and land resources. It establishes a "Natural Resources Protection Fund" that collects money from permit fees, donations, and other sources, and specifies how those funds are to be used. Starting July 1, 2025, the bill changes the way unspent funds are handled, allowing more money to stay in the fund for ongoing projects. It also directs a portion of sales tax revenue from electric power distribution to support the state's air pollution control program. Overall, the bill aims to improve funding for environmental protection while providing clearer rules for managing these funds.
