summary: |
  This law changes the rules for summer camps and child care facilities in Missouri. It requires the Department of Elementary and Secondary Education to keep records of any verified parental complaints about these programs and make them available to the public. Additionally, it clarifies which types of child care and summer camps need to be licensed and which setups are exempt, such as small home care, religious, or school-related programs. These updates help ensure that children are cared for safely and that parents have access to important information about child care providers.
