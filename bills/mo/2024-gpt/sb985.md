summary: |
  This bill changes the rules about what homeowners' associations and property restrictions can and can't prohibit. Specifically, it stops restrictions from banning political signs, solar panels, or sale signs on private property. Homeowners will have more freedom to display political messages, install solar energy devices, and put up signs when selling their homes. The bill also gives homeowners' associations some authority to set reasonable rules about how and when signs and solar panels can be displayed or installed, but they cannot completely forbid them.
