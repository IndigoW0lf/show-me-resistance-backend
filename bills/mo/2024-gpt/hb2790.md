summary: |
  The bill updates Missouri laws regarding loans and credit agreements. It limits the fees lenders can charge for small personal loans, capping certain fees at $10. It also makes it illegal for lenders to charge extra fees that are not allowed by law for loans under $1,000 used mainly for personal or household needs. Additionally, the bill restricts the types of interest and late payment charges lenders can apply, ensuring that borrowers are protected from excessive fees. These changes primarily impact lenders, borrowers, and anyone involved in small personal loans or credit arrangements in Missouri.
