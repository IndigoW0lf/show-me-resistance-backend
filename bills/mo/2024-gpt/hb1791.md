summary: |
  The bill, known as HB1791, mandates that every vote-counting process during elections in Missouri must be livestreamed and recorded. These recordings will become public records, meaning anyone can view or access them. The goal is to increase transparency and ensure the public can see how votes are counted in real time and afterward. This change affects election officials, voters, and anyone interested in election transparency by making the vote-counting process more open and accessible.
