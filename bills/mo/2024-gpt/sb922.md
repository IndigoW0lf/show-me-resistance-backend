summary: |
  This bill updates the laws in Missouri that govern how cities can expand their borders by annexing nearby unincorporated areas. It allows city governments to annex land that is contiguous and compact to their current boundaries under new, clearer guidelines. The bill specifies what counts as contiguous and compact, including situations where highways or railroads might create non-contiguous boundaries, as long as certain conditions are met. It also introduces rules about limiting how often neighboring areas can be annexed and creates special provisions for certain counties near the Mississippi River. These changes affect city governments, property owners, and residents living in areas that might be annexed by nearby cities.
