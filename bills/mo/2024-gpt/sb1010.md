summary_short: "This bill continues the tax deduction benefit for long-term care savings accounts in Missouri."
summary: |
  This bill reauthorizes a tax deduction for Missouri residents who contribute to long-term care savings accounts, known as "long-term dignity savings accounts." Taxpayers can deduct 100% of their contributions, up to $4,000 per person or $8,000 for married couples filing jointly, from their Missouri income tax. The bill also states that income earned from these accounts is not subject to state income tax, as long as it is used for approved expenses and meets certain rules. It affects state residents who have or want to open these savings accounts, making it easier to save for future long-term care needs while receiving tax benefits.
