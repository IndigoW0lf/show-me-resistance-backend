summary_short: "This bill creates the Education Freedom Act and updates school assessment requirements in Missouri."

summary: |
  This bill, known as the Education Freedom Act, repeals some existing assessment laws and establishes new guidelines for how public schools are evaluated in Missouri. It directs the state board of education to develop a flexible, performance-based statewide assessment system that measures students' problem-solving, creativity, and practical skills, in addition to traditional subjects. These assessments will be used mainly to ensure compliance with federal law and not to categorize or rank schools or districts. The bill also allows some schools to demonstrate exceptional achievement and potentially receive waivers from certain rules.
