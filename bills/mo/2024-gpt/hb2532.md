summary_short: "Private employers offering paid family and medical leave must now include leave for adoption and foster care under the same terms as other family leave."
summary: |
  This bill requires private companies that provide paid family and medical leave to also grant the same leave to employees for reasons related to adoption and fostering of children. This includes leave for the child's birth, placement, and bonding afterward. The leave must be offered under the same conditions and coverage as other types of family leave the employer provides. The goal is to support employees welcoming adopted or foster children just as they are supported when welcoming biological children.
