summary_short: "This bill allows circuit courts in Missouri to dissolve a limited liability company (LLC) either through a court order or at the request of members under certain conditions."

summary: |
  The bill gives circuit courts the authority to dissolve a Missouri LLC if it was created through fraud, exceeded legal authority, engaged in illegal or fraudulent activities, or acted against public policy. Additionally, if members find it difficult or impossible to run the LLC according to their operating agreement—due to issues like management deadlock, abandonment, or fraud—they can ask the court to dissolve the company. This law aims to protect public interests and the rights of members by providing clear legal options for ending problematic or harmful LLCs.
