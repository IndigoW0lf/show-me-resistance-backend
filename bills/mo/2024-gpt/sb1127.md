  Bill SB1127 changes Missouri law to make vitamins, specifically certain types, tax-free when purchased. This means people buying qualifying vitamins won't have to pay sales tax on them, which can make these health products more affordable. The bill primarily impacts consumers and retailers dealing with vitamins, but it does not change the tax rules for other products or goods. Overall, it aims to promote access to vitamins by reducing their cost through tax exemptions.
