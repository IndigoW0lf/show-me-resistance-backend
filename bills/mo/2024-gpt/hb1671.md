summary_short: "This bill changes the way 'qualified students' are defined for the Missouri Empowerment Scholarship Accounts Program."

summary: |
  The bill updates the rules for who can qualify for the Missouri Empowerment Scholarship Accounts Program. It specifically revises the criteria for students to be considered "qualified," focusing on those with special education needs or from low-income households. The changes help clarify eligibility, so more students who need support can potentially access scholarships for private, public, charter, or homeschooling options. This affects students, families, schools, and organizations involved in the program by expanding or clarifying who can participate.
