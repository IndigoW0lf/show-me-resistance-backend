summary_short: "This bill allows certain senior citizens to receive a property tax credit to reduce their local homestead property taxes."
summary: |
  The bill updates rules about property tax credits for senior residents in Missouri. It lets counties offer a credit to eligible seniors who own and live in their homes, helping reduce the amount of property tax they owe each year. To qualify, seniors must be at least the age when they can start receiving Social Security benefits and pay taxes on their home. Counties can choose to adopt this program either through a local ordinance or by putting the question to voters in a referendum. If approved, eligible seniors will see a tax credit reflected on their tax bills, easing their financial burden.
