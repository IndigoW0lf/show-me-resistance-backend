summary: |
  This bill updates Missouri law to specify that certified registered nurse anesthetists (CRNAs) can select, order, and administer controlled substances during anesthesia care without needing a collaborative agreement or supervision from a doctor or other healthcare provider. It also clarifies the prescribing rights of other advanced practice nurses who have controlled substance prescriptive authority, but it limits their ability to prescribe Schedule II medications like hydrocodone, especially for themselves or family members. Overall, the bill aims to define the roles and responsibilities of CRNAs and other healthcare professionals regarding controlled substances to improve clarity and flexibility in providing anesthesia and medical care.
