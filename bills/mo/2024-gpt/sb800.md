summary_short: "This bill allows Missouri cities and counties to create or use civilian review boards to investigate misconduct by police officers."
summary: |
  The bill changes existing law to allow local governments in Missouri to establish or utilize civilian review boards or oversight entities dedicated to investigating complaints about police officer behavior. These boards can look into allegations such as excessive force, abuse of authority, discourtesy, or offensive language, including racial or other discrimination. They do not receive pay but can be reimbursed for expenses, and their findings and recommendations are submitted to police leadership. The purpose is to promote transparency and accountability in law enforcement while ensuring investigations are based on credible information.
