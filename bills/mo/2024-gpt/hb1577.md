summary_short: "This bill allows Missouri law enforcement leaders to request help from other jurisdictions, including outside Missouri, for police assistance and arrests."
summary: |
  This bill grants the chief law enforcement officer in any law enforcement agency in Missouri the authority to ask for assistance from another law enforcement agency, even if it is located outside Missouri. It explains how officers can make arrests across jurisdiction lines and the process for handing off suspects. The bill also confirms that officers remain employees of their original agency while assisting and that existing laws about mutual aid and legal protections still apply. It aims to improve cooperation between law enforcement agencies across jurisdictions to better address crime and public safety.
