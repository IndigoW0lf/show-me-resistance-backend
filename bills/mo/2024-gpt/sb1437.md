summary: |
  The bill revises the laws related to drug trafficking in Missouri by changing the definitions and penalties for trafficking different types and amounts of drugs. It specifies the quantities that classify a crime as first-degree trafficking, which is a serious felony, and increases the severity to a first-degree felony if larger amounts are involved. The law affects anyone involved in the distribution, manufacturing, or delivery of illegal drugs, making clear the amounts that trigger different levels of criminal charges. These changes aim to strengthen the state's ability to combat drug-related crimes and ensure appropriate penalties based on the amount and type of drug involved.
