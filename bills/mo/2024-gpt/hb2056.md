summary: |
  This bill makes it official that cities, towns, and the Department of Transportation must reimburse utility companies, such as internet, cable, and telecom providers, for costs they incur when relocating their equipment due to road work or repairs. It sets rules for how local governments can fund road projects and ensures that utility providers are fairly compensated when their infrastructure needs to be moved. The goal is to facilitate better road maintenance and development while fairly sharing the costs with utility companies that are affected.
