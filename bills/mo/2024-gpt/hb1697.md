summary: |
  The bill, called HB1697, makes it clear that Missouri and its local governments cannot spend taxpayer funds on reparations that are tied to a person's race, religion, gender identity, sexual orientation, or economic status. It aims to ensure public money is not used for programs or payments intended for reparations related to these categories. This affects state and local government budgets by restricting the use of taxpayer dollars for such purposes.
