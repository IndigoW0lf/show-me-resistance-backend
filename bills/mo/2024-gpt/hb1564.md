summary: |
  This bill changes the rules for some small cities in Missouri, allowing them to put new taxes on hotel rooms and food sales. These taxes can be up to 6% on hotel stays and 2% on food sales, and the money must be used for things like public safety and infrastructure projects. Before these taxes can be collected, the city must ask voters in an election for permission. If most voters agree, the taxes can start a few months later. This affects residents, visitors, local businesses, and anyone interested in how small cities raise funds for public services.
