summary: |
  This law mandates that all public schools in Missouri keep their shower rooms, locker rooms, and restrooms separate by biological sex — meaning males use male-designated facilities and females use female-designated facilities. When students are in a state of undress in these areas, they must be in spaces reserved for their biological sex to ensure privacy and safety. If a student’s gender identity is different from their biological sex, they can request alternative accommodations, such as single-stall or unisex bathrooms, but these cannot be shared with students of the opposite biological sex. Parental or guardian consent is required for minors to use these alternative facilities. The bill aims to clarify and restrict access to certain facilities based on biological sex, affecting students, parents, and school staff.
