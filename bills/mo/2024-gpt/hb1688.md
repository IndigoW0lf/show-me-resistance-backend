summary: |
  This bill makes it mandatory for all public high schools and charter schools in Missouri to offer a driver education course to students in grades 10 through 12 starting with the 2025-26 school year. The course will cover safe driving skills, traffic laws, distracted driving, emergency situations, and proper interactions with law enforcement during traffic stops. Students will not be required to physically operate a vehicle as part of the instruction, but the program aims to prepare them with important knowledge for safe driving. Schools can choose to offer additional driver education courses if they wish. The state board of education will develop guidelines for the program, and rules will be created to ensure proper implementation and safety standards.
