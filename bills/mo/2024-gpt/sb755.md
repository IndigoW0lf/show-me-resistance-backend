summary_short: "This bill changes how long law enforcement can hold someone without a warrant before they must be released, with longer times for serious crimes."

summary: |
  The bill amends existing laws regarding the detention of people who are arrested without a warrant. It states that generally, anyone taken into custody without a warrant must be released within 24 hours unless they are formally charged with a crime by a sworn complaint and held on a warrant. For serious crimes involving dangerous felonies or weapons, this detention period is extended to 48 hours. The bill also emphasizes that individuals arrested without a warrant have the right to speak with a lawyer or their representatives during detention. It applies to law enforcement agencies across Missouri and aims to protect people's rights during arrest and detention.
