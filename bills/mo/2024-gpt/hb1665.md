summary_short: "This bill allows certain county hospitals in Missouri to invest their funds in stocks, bonds, and money-market investments instead of just traditional options."

summary: |
  The bill updates the laws governing how county hospitals in Missouri can invest their money. Specifically, it lets hospitals located in specific counties (those with populations between 150,000 and 200,000) invest up to a portion of their funds—previously a set limit—in stocks, bonds, and other financial instruments. This change applies only to hospitals that receive less than 1% of their annual revenue from county or state taxes. The goal is to give these hospitals more flexibility to manage their funds effectively and potentially increase their financial resources.
