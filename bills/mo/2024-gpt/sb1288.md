summary: |
  This bill requires political parties in Missouri to officially submit the names of their presidential and vice-presidential candidates, as well as their chosen presidential electors, within specific deadlines before each presidential election. The plans include certifying the nominees in writing to the Secretary of State and providing sworn declarations of candidacy. The law also prohibits certifying any presidential candidate who is currently under a House impeachment inquiry that hasn't been resolved. These rules aim to clarify and formalize the nomination process and ensure transparency for voters.
