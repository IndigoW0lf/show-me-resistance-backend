summary_short: "This bill allows health insurance to reimburse for services provided by trained doulas to pregnant women and their families in Missouri."
summary: |
  The bill creates a program under Missouri law that recognizes trained doulas â€” individuals who support pregnant women with emotional, physical, and educational help, but do not provide medical care. The Department of Health and Senior Services will establish rules, create a registration process, review applications, and maintain a list of approved doulas eligible for insurance reimbursement. This means that in the future, some doula services may be covered by health insurance, making these support services more accessible and affordable for families across the state.
