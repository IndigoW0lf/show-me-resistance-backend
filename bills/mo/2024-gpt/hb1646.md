summary_short: "This bill requires the state to oversee unaccredited school districts and establish special administrative boards to run them when needed."

summary: |
  This bill ensures that if a school district in Missouri fails to meet the required school year length or loses accreditation, the state will review how the district is governed. The state can then either allow the existing school board to continue or create a special administrative board to manage the district. This special board will have at least seven members, including residents and education professionals, to help improve the district and return it to accreditation. The bill also sets up public hearings to involve the community and support districts in regaining their accreditation status. It affects school districts that are unaccredited or have lost accreditation, state education officials, school boards, and local communities.
