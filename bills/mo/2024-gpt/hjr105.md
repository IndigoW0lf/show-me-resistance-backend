summary_short: "This bill proposes amending Missouri's Constitution to guarantee a right to abortion care and reproductive freedom for all individuals."
summary: |
  The bill adds a new section to Missouri's Constitution stating that everyone has a fundamental right to make decisions about their reproductive health, including abortion and contraception. It also protects people from being penalized or prosecuted for pregnancy outcomes like miscarriage or abortion, and prohibits discrimination against those providing or receiving reproductive healthcare. The goal is to ensure that reproductive choices are protected by law unless the government can prove a compelling reason that is the least restrictive way to protect public health.
