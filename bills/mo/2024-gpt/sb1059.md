summary: |
  This bill establishes the Missouri Education Intervention Task Force, a group tasked with helping the state's lowest-performing school districts improve. Each year, the department of elementary and secondary education will identify the ten districts with the poorest academic results. The governor can then designate some of these districts as "districts in need," placing them under the control of the new task force. The task force, made up of five members with educational backgrounds, will provide oversight and support to help these districts succeed. The goal is to improve educational outcomes for students in struggling districts across Missouri.
