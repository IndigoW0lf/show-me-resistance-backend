summary_short: "This bill updates the rules for qualifying as a candidate for public office in Missouri, including requirements related to criminal history and tax payments."
summary: |
  The bill makes changes to who can run for public office in Missouri. It states that anyone convicted of or pleading guilty to a federal or state felony cannot qualify as a candidate. Additionally, candidates must not be late on paying state or local taxes, including income, property, or municipal taxes. Candidates also need to sign an affidavit declaring they owe no taxes and have no unpaid taxes that could disqualify them. If a candidate is found to have lied about their tax status or is delinquent on taxes after filing, they can be disqualified from running or participating in elections. This law aims to ensure that only qualified individuals with clear legal and financial standing can stand for public office.
