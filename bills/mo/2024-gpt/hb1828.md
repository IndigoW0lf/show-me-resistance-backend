summary_short: "This bill changes the rules for how many days or hours a public school must be in session each year in Missouri."

summary: |
  The bill revises Missouri's requirements for the minimum school term that public schools need to meet each year. Instead of specifying a set number of days, it now focuses on a minimum of 1,044 hours of student attendance over the school year. Certain districts, especially those in larger cities or with a county charter, must have at least 168 school days unless they adopt a four-day school week. The bill also updates definitions related to schools, districts, and programs, aiming to give districts more flexibility in scheduling and planning their school years. It affects public school districts, school boards, and students across Missouri by adjusting the way school term length is measured and managed.
