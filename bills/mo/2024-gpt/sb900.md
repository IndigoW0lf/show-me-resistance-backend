summary: |
  This bill changes the rules for how counties in Missouri can form and operate regional jail districts. It allows two or more neighboring counties to agree to create a shared jail district, which includes all the areas within those counties. The bill sets out what information must be included in the agreement, such as how costs are shared and how the jail is run. It also clarifies the powers of these districts, like building, maintaining, and financing jail facilities. The goal is to give counties more flexibility and clarity in managing regional jails, which can affect local governments, law enforcement, and residents in the involved areas.
