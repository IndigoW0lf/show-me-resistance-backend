summary_short: "This bill allows Missouri state agencies to adopt a four-day, 40-hour workweek of ten hours per day and clarifies holiday pay rules for employees on this schedule."

summary: |
  The bill enables state agencies and departments in Missouri to implement a four-day workweek with ten-hour days, if approved by the agency director or responsible authority. If an employee's scheduled workday coincides with a state holiday, they will not have to use their personal leave to cover the holiday; the holiday will count as paid time, even if it falls on their longer workday. This change gives more flexibility to government workers and helps improve work schedules while ensuring holiday pay is handled fairly.
