summary: |
  The bill updates Missouri's constitution to add employees of school districts to the list of allowable jobs for state lawmakers. Previously, lawmakers could not hold any other paid position, but now they can work for school districts without forfeiting their legislative office. This change clarifies that being an employee of a school district will not disqualify a state senator or representative from serving in their legislative role. It also specifies that lawmakers remain in office and continue to be paid during their term even if they accept other employment with school districts. The amendment aims to clarify the rules around combined employment for legislators, especially in the education sector.
