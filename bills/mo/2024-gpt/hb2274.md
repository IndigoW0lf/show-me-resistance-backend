summary: |
  This bill changes the way Missouri taxes corporate income. Currently, companies pay a tax based on their profits, but this bill plans to gradually reduce and then eliminate that tax over several years, ending in 2028. Starting from 2025, the tax rate will decrease each year until it reaches zero in 2028. This change will mainly affect businesses operating in Missouri by lowering their tax burden over time. However, it does not apply to out-of-state businesses working in Missouri and may impact tax credits once the tax is fully phased out.
