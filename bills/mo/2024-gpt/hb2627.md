summary: |
  This bill makes changes to how community paramedic services are provided in Missouri. It clarifies who can be a certified community paramedic—requiring licensed paramedics to complete approved training—and how these services can be offered outside of emergency situations. Ambulance services must have agreements if they want to provide these services in areas served by other ambulance providers. The goal is to ensure proper certification, clear protocols, and smooth cooperation among emergency response providers, improving healthcare access for communities.
