summary_short: "This bill stops residents from one county special road district from signing petitions or voting on road issues outside their district."
summary: |
  The bill makes it so that residents who live in a county special road district cannot sign petitions or vote on issues related to county roads outside of their own district. This means if someone lives in one district, they will only be able to participate in matters that affect their district, not other districts. The change applies to petitions and ballot issues starting from August 28, 2024, promoting local decision-making and preventing residents from influencing roads outside their area.
