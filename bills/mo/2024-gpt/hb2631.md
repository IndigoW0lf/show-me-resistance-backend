summary: |
  This bill, called the "Uniform Unregulated Child Custody Transfer Act," establishes clear laws around transferring custody of children to prevent unsafe or unauthorized placements. It defines key terms such as "child," "custody," and who is involved in custody transfers. The law aims to restrict transfers made without proper oversight, especially those happening outside of formal legal processes, and outlines who is exempt from these rules, like certain relatives and tribal members. It also sets penalties for violations to ensure children's safety and stability when custody is transferred. The law mainly affects parents, guardians, intermediaries, and child-placing agencies, helping to prevent illegal or risky custody arrangements and promote the child's best interests.
