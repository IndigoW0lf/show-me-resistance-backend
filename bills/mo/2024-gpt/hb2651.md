summary: |
  Starting January 1, 2025, the bill sets new rules for valuing solar energy projects for property tax purposes, assessing 37.5% of their original cost as their value. It also classifies land used for solar energy generation as commercial property. Additionally, the bill clarifies that utility-related structures like bridges and transmission lines owned or controlled by electric, telegraph, or pipeline companies are subject to property taxes similar to railroad property. These changes aim to improve taxation consistency for solar projects and utility infrastructure in Missouri.
