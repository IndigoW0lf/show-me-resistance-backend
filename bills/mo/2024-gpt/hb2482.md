summary: |
  The bill changes the way local governments in Missouri can give property tax relief to senior homeowners. It defines who qualifies as an eligible taxpayerâ€”specifically, residents aged 62 or older who own and live in their homes and are current on their taxes. Qualified seniors can benefit from a tax credit that reduces any increases in their property taxes, helping them keep their homes affordable. Local counties can choose to offer this credit either through their own laws or by asking voters in a referendum. The bill aims to make it easier for older homeowners to receive property tax relief and gives counties clear rules on how to provide these credits.
