summary_short: "This resolution urges Congress to create consistent voting laws for all federal elections to increase public trust."

summary: |
  This bill encourages Congress to establish uniform rules for voting in all federal elections across the United States. It was prompted by concerns about low public confidence in election results, especially after delays and differences in voting procedures among states. If adopted, these standardized laws would cover issues like voter registration, identification, voting methods, and how votes are counted. The goal is to make federal elections fairer, more reliable, and easier for people to trust and participate in.
