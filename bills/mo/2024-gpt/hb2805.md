summary_short: "This bill introduces ranked-choice voting for elections in Missouri, allowing voters to rank candidates by preference and ensuring winners have a majority vote."
summary: |
  The bill requires all primary and general elections in Missouri to use ranked-choice ballots, where voters can rank candidates in order of preference. It changes how votes are counted, redistributing votes from eliminated candidates until one candidate has more than half of the votes. This process ensures that elected officials have the support of a majority of voters. The legislation affects all offices that require voting, from local to federal levels, and aims to make elections more representative by preventing candidates from winning with only a plurality of votes.
