summary_short: "This bill requires all firearm sales or transfers in Missouri to go through a licensed dealer, including online transactions, to ensure background checks and legal compliance."
summary: |
  This bill, known as HB 2715, makes it so that any sale or transfer of a firearm must be processed through a licensed firearms dealer unless the buyer and seller are both licensed dealers. If neither party is a licensed dealer, they must use a licensed dealer to facilitate the transfer, who will handle background checks and ensure the transfer follows all legal requirements. The law also states that licensed dealers can charge fees for processing these transactions. This change is designed to increase oversight and accountability in firearm transfers, affecting private individuals, estate executors, and anyone involved in transferring firearms in Missouri.
