  The bill modifies the rules about when and how offenders in Missouri can attend funerals.

To attend a funeral, the offender must be escorted by an officer, and they are responsible for any costs involved. The bill aims to allow offenders to participate in important family events while maintaining oversight and safety. It also requires departments to notify courts and officials about the travel plans in advance, except in emergencies or special circumstances.
