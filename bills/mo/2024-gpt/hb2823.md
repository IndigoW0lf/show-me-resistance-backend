summary: |
  This bill updates Missouri laws related to public nuisances, which are ongoing acts or conditions that harm community safety or welfare. It specifies what counts as a public nuisance and sets penalties for continuing harmful activities. Importantly, it protects residents, tenants, and landlords from being penalized if they call law enforcement or emergency services in genuine emergencies or to report crimes or abuse. If a local government wrongfully penalizes someone for doing so, that person can take legal action to stop the unfair practice and seek damages. The goal is to ensure community safety while safeguarding people's rights to seek help.
