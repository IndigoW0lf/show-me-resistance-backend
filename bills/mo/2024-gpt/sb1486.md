summary: |
  This bill changes existing laws to define what counts as an "unborn child." It states that life begins at conception and that unborn children have rights related to life and well-being. However, it clarifies that embryos created through in vitro fertilization (IVF) before they are implanted in the uterus are not considered "unborn children" under this law. This means that certain protections and rights do not apply to these embryos until they are successfully implanted. The bill also emphasizes that women are not legally responsible for harming their unborn children if they do not follow specific prenatal care routines. It was enacted quickly to support access to fertility treatments and healthy pregnancies in Missouri.
