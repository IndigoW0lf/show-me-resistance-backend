summary_short: "A proposed Missouri constitutional amendment to protect and clarify gun rights, allowing local governments to regulate firearm possession and permits."
summary: |
  This bill proposes a change to Missouri's Constitution to strengthen the right of citizens to keep and bear arms. It states that these rights are unalienable and must be upheld, while also allowing laws to limit gun rights for convicted violent felons or people judged to be a danger due to mental health issues. The bill gives local governments like cities and counties the power to create their own rules for firearm permits and possession, including issuing permits, requiring background checks, and setting penalties for violations. These local regulations can apply to residents and non-residents, with certain exemptions for law enforcement, judges, military, and security personnel. The goal is to clarify gun rights protections while allowing local governments to regulate gun use within their communities.
