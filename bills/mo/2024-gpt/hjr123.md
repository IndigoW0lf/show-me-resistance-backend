summary_short: "This bill removes restrictions on people judged mentally incapacitated from voting in Missouri elections."
summary: |
  The bill updates Missouri’s constitution to allow all qualified voters who are over 18 and residents of the state—regardless of mental capacity status—to cast their ballots. Previously, people with certain mental incapacities or who were involuntarily confined in mental institutions were barred from voting. Now, only individuals convicted of a felony or crimes related to voting can be legally excluded. This change means more people with mental health challenges may have the right to vote, provided they meet other registration and residency requirements.
