summary_short: "This bill changes Missouri's income tax rates for residents through 2025, including temporary rate reductions for 2023 and 2024 based on state revenue."
summary: |
  This bill revises the state's income tax laws for residents, setting new tax rates that apply to taxable income up through $9,000. It introduces a tiered tax system where higher incomes are taxed at higher rates, starting at 1.5% and increasing up to 6%. Special provisions temporarily lower the top tax rate to 4.95% in 2023 and 2024, and there are rules for additional rate reductions if the state's revenue increases significantly. These changes impact residents filing taxes during 2023, 2024, and 2025 by adjusting the amount of tax they owe based on their income and the state's economic performance.
