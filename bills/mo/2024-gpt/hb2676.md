summary: |
  This bill states that people who have committed specific crimes, particularly those involving child exploitation or abuse, are not allowed to be within 500 feet of Missouri state parks, public parks with playgrounds, swimming pools, sports complexes, or museums that primarily serve children. If someone with such a record is found in these areas, they could face serious legal consequences, including felony charges. The law aims to protect children and the public by keeping known offenders away from places where kids gather. The first violation is a Class E felony, and subsequent violations are classified as Class D felonies. The bill also includes provisions allowing parents or guardians attending educational or nature programs with children to be on the property with permission from the centerâ€™s manager.
