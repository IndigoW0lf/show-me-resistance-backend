summary: |
  This bill changes the laws in Missouri about how courts handle child custody and support when paternity is involved. It requires court decisions to be based on the actual court order, including details like support, custody, visitation, and security. The bill also clarifies that child support is usually paid regularly but can sometimes be paid as a lump sum, and it sets a presumption about the correct amount of support based on court rules, unless proven unjust. Additionally, the law outlines factors courts should consider when deciding support amounts and custody arrangements, such as the child's needs, parents' incomes, and family circumstances. These updates aim to make child custody and support decisions clearer, fairer, and focused on whatâ€™s best for the child.
