summary_short: "Ensures people can get prescribed drugs covered by their insurance without unnecessary substitutions, with some exceptions."

summary: |
  This bill requires health insurance plans in Missouri to cover the specific medications prescribed by a healthcare provider if the prescription was made before or after January 1, 2025. It means that insurers cannot force a patient to switch to a different drug they believe is more suitable unless their healthcare provider provides written approval and confirms the switch is in the patientâ€™s best interest. The law also allows for interchangeable biological products to be substituted conveniently but does not apply if stepping-therapy protocols are in play. Overall, this bill helps ensure patients can access the medication their doctor prescribes without unnecessary changes or hurdles.
