summary_short: "This bill sets new limits on the amount of vinyl chloride allowed in public drinking water in Missouri, gradually lowering the maximum level over five years."
summary: |
  The bill updates Missouri's rules for drinking water by establishing new safety limits for vinyl chloride, a chemical that can contaminate water. Starting January 1, 2025, the amount of vinyl chloride in public water systems must not exceed 1.8 parts per billion, with the limit decreasing each year until it reaches 1 part per billion in 2029. This helps ensure safer drinking water for residents by reducing exposure to this chemical over time. Water providers and regulators will need to follow these new standards to keep water supplies safe.
