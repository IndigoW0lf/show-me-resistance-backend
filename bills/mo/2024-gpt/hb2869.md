summary_short: "This bill strengthens rules about visiting loved ones in health care facilities, allowing more in-person visits with certain rules and penalties for violations."

summary: |
  This bill, called the "Compassionate Care Visitation Act," makes it clearer that patients in hospitals, long-term care, or hospice facilities can have visitors for emotional, physical, or end-of-life support. It requires health care facilities to allow at least two visitors at the same time during designated visiting hours, which must be at least six hours each day, including evenings, weekends, and holidays. The bill also states that visitors should be able to come and go during visiting hours and that certain groups like parents or guardians can be with minors receiving care. Facilities can set some limits, like restricting visitor numbers or access to certain areas, but they can't deny visitors without good reason. The bill aims to make visiting loved ones easier and more consistent, while also including penalties if facilities don't follow these rules.
