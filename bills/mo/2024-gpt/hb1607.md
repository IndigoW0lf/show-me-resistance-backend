summary_short: "Missouri will stay on Standard Time and not participate in Daylight Saving Time unless the federal government changes the rules."
summary: |
  This bill states that starting on November 5, 2024, Missouri will set its clocks back to Standard Time and will not switch to Daylight Saving Time after that. However, if the federal government changes the national rules to adopt Daylight Saving Time as the new standard, Missouri will follow that change. The bill essentially limits Missouri's participation in Daylight Saving Time and keeps the state on a fixed schedule unless federal law is modified. It affects residents, businesses, and government operations within Missouri by establishing how the time change is handled.
