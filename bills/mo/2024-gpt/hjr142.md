summary_short: "This bill proposes a constitutional amendment in Missouri to clarify and expand gun rights while allowing local regulation within certain limits."

summary: |
  The bill aims to change Missouri's Constitution to reaffirm that citizens have the unalienable right to keep and bear arms, including ammunition and accessories, for self-defense, protecting property, or when called upon by authorities. It also states that any restrictions on these rights must be carefully scrutinized and that the state must protect individuals from infringements. However, it allows local governments in Missouri, like Kansas City and St. Louis, to pass ordinances regulating the possession and carrying of firearms, including issuing permits and setting penalties, as long as they follow certain rules. The bill impacts gun owners, law enforcement, and local governments across Missouri.
