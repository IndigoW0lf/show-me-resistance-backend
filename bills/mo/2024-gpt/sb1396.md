summary_short: "This law sets rules for non-compete agreements with doctors in Missouri to ensure fairness and clarity."
summary: |
  The bill clarifies when and how doctors can be asked to agree not to work with other employers for a certain time and distance. It states that such agreements, called covenants not to compete, are only valid if the doctor is providing outpatient healthcare services. Additionally, these agreements can't last longer than one year and must be within 50 miles of the doctor's office. The law also limits enforceability if the employer is a nonprofit hospital or healthcare organization. This protects physicians while maintaining fair business practices in healthcare.
