summary: |
  The bill gives counties in Missouri the power to create their own rules about where waste disposal sites can be located. It sets limits on how close these sites can be to places like cities, schools, churches, homes, and parks. Specifically, waste sites must be at least 3 miles away from cities and schools, three-quarters of a mile from homes used regularly, and 200 feet from the property line of the site. This helps protect residents and community spaces from potential health and safety issues related to waste disposal sites.
