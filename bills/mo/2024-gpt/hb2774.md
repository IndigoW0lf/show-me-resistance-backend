summary: |
  This bill gives middle and high schools in Missouri the option to teach students about the criminal justice system as part of their existing social studies or political science classes. Schools can include lessons on how law enforcement and the justice system work at the local, state, and national levels. They can also work with local law enforcement agencies to develop the curriculum and highlight career opportunities in law enforcement. The goal is to provide students with a better understanding of the justice system and explore careers in law enforcement.
