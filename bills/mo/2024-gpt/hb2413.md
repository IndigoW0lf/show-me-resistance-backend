summary_short: "This bill removes the requirement for mammogram providers to give detailed notices about dense breast tissue and additional cancer risk factors."

summary: |
  The bill repeals a law that used to require mammogram facilities to inform patients if they have dense breast tissue and possible risks. Starting after January 1, 2015, these notices are no longer mandatory. The change aims to simplify the process for medical providers while still ensuring patients receive their test results. It does not increase legal responsibility for the facilities beyond providing the results and the limited notice. This mainly affects imaging centers and women undergoing mammograms by changing the information they are formally entitled to receive.
