summary_short: "This bill removes the requirement for drivers to wear seat belts and instead focuses on child passenger safety rules in Missouri."
summary: |
  The bill repeals existing laws that made seat belt wearing mandatory for all drivers and passengers. Instead, it sets specific rules for protecting children in vehicles, such as requiring children under 16 to be secured in appropriate safety seats or belts based on their age, weight, and height. The law also specifies that children may sit in the back seat without a booster seat if the car's back seat does not have a proper shoulder belt for booster seats. Violating these new child safety rules can result in minor fines, but there is no longer a strict seat belt law for adult drivers and passengers. The focus shifts from general seat belt enforcement to ensuring children are safely restrained when traveling in vehicles.
