summary_short: "Public colleges and universities in Missouri must give course credit for high scores on IB exams."

summary: |
  This bill requires Missouri's in-state public colleges and universities to award college credit to students who score 4 or higher on International Baccalaureate (IB) exams. When students apply and are accepted, the schools will determine how much college credit they can earn based on their exam scores. This helps students save time and money by potentially skipping some entry-level courses if they've proven knowledge through IB exams.
