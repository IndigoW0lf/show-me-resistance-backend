summary_short: "Missouri insurance plans will cover self-administered hormonal contraceptives starting in 2025."
summary: |
  This bill requires health insurance plans in Missouri to cover the cost of self-administered hormonal contraceptives, like certain types of birth control pills, beginning on January 1, 2025. It means if you have a health plan that already covers similar contraceptive methods, it will also pay for supplies of contraceptives that you can take on your own for up to a year. The coverage will be fair and not require higher deductibles or co-pays than other comparable health services. This change aims to make contraception more accessible and affordable for those who choose self-administered options.
