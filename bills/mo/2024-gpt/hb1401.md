summary_short: "This bill makes trespassing on land illegal for undocumented immigrants and sets penalties for violations."

summary: |
  This law defines for the first time in Missouri the crime of trespassing by someone who is in the U.S. illegally. If a person is on public or private land without the proper identification or registration, they can be charged with a felony. The law does not apply to those who have federal permission to stay in the country. It mainly affects undocumented immigrants who do not carry the necessary registration documents and are on land without authorization.
