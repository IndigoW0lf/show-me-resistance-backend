summary_short: "This bill allows great-grandparents to request visitation rights with their great-grandchildren under certain conditions."
summary: |
  This law changes the rules to give great-grandparents, as well as grandparents, the ability to ask for visitation rights with a child. These rights can be granted if the grandparent has been unfairly denied access for more than sixty days and certain conditions are met, such as the parents' divorce, the death of a parent with the surviving parent denying visitation, or if the child has lived with the grandparent for at least six months in the past two years. The court will decide if visitation is in the child's best interests, and can enforce conditions or restrictions. This law aims to help maintain family connections, especially in cases of family separation, loss, or where children have lived with grandparents or great-grandparents.
