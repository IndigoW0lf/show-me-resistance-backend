summary_short: "Public schools with high numbers of low-income students will be required to offer breakfast after the start of the school day, starting in 2024-25."

summary: |
  This bill requires certain public and charter schools in Missouri to offer breakfast to students after the school day has begun but before lunch. The goal is to make sure students who might be hungry in the morning can eat and start their day ready to learn. Schools affected are those with high percentages of students eligible for free or reduced-price meals, or those participating in specific meal programs. Schools can choose different methods to provide breakfast, like classroom service or grab-and-go options. If a school already has most of its eligible students eating breakfast, it won't be required to add this program. The Department of Elementary and Secondary Education will help by notifying schools and providing guidelines for implementing the program.
