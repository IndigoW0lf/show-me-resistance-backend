summary_short: "Allows the St. Louis City Sheriff to appoint the corrections commissioner with approval from the city’s Board of Aldermen."

summary: |
  This bill proposes changing the Missouri Constitution to give the Sheriff of St. Louis City the authority to appoint the person in charge of the city’s detention and correctional facilities. The appointed officer would handle running the jails, reviewing parole requests, and overseeing parole and probation supervision. The appointment would need the approval (advice and consent) of the St. Louis Board of Aldermen, and the board could remove this officer with a two-thirds vote. This change affects how the city manages its correctional services and who has the authority to choose key officials overseeing detention and criminal justice functions.
