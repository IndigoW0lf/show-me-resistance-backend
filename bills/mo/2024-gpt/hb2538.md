summary_short: "This bill adds more options for photo ID required to vote and explains how voters can verify their identity."
summary: |
  This bill updates the rules for voting in Missouri. It specifies the types of photo ID that voters can show, including Missouri driver’s licenses, student IDs, and certain military or veteran IDs. If a voter doesn’t have one of these IDs, they can still vote with a provisional ballot, but they must fill out an affidavit and provide some personal information. The goal is to make it easier for people to prove their identity when voting while keeping the process secure.
