summary_short: "This bill requires the state to pay attorney's fees and related costs if a local government wins a civil case brought against it by the state's attorney general."
summary: |
  The bill says that if the attorney general sues a local government, like a school district, and the local government wins the case, the state must cover the legal costs the local government spent defending itself. These costs include attorney's fees, court fees, and other related expenses. The money to pay these costs will come from the state's annual budget for the attorney generalâ€™s office, ensuring that local governments are financially protected when they successfully defend against legal actions initiated by the attorney general.
