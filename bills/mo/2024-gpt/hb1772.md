summary_short: "This law allows people who have completed their sentences for nonviolent felonies to legally possess firearms."

summary: |
  The bill changes the rules about owning guns in Missouri. It states that if someone has finished serving their sentence for a nonviolent felony, they are no longer automatically prohibited from owning or possessing a firearm. This means more ex-offenders of nonviolent crimes can now legally carry guns. However, the law still restricts firearm possession for those with violent felony convictions, those on probation or parole, fugitives, or those deemed mentally incompetent. The law does not apply to antique firearms. It aims to help people rebuild their lives after completing nonviolent crimes while maintaining restrictions on more serious offenders.
