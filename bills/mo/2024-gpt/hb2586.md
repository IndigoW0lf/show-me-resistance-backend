summary_short: "This law bans the sale and distribution of unsafe, counterfeit, or child-appealing lighters in Missouri."

summary: |
  This bill makes it illegal to sell or give away certain types of lighters in Missouri, including those that are unsafe, counterfeit, or designed to look like toys or cartoon characters that appeal to young children. It defines what counts as a counterfeit or unsafe lighter and specifies that novelty lighters that are attractive to children cannot be sold or offered for sale. However, the bill allows the transportation and storage of these lighters in warehouses or distribution centers that do not sell directly to the public. The law is intended to protect consumers, especially children, from dangerous or deceptive lighting devices.
