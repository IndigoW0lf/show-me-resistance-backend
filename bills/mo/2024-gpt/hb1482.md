summary_short: "This bill allows cities and counties in Missouri to create civilian review boards to investigate police misconduct complaints."
summary: |
  The bill changes existing laws to give local governments in Missouri the ability to set up civilian review boards or similar groups that oversee police conduct. These groups can investigate allegations from the public about issues like excessive force, abuse of authority, or offensive language by law enforcement officers. The reviews and recommendations made by these groups are shared with police leadership. The law specifies that these boards cannot receive compensation, only reimbursement for expenses, and their investigations are limited to specific misconduct complaints, ensuring accountability and transparency in law enforcement.
