summary_short: "This bill updates residency rules for city boards in certain Missouri fourth-class cities, allowing property or business ownership to satisfy residency requirements."

summary: |
  This bill makes it easier for people to serve on city boards in some Missouri cities classified as fourth class. Normally, members must live within the city limits. The bill says that if a person owns property or has a business in the city, that counts as meeting the residency requirement, even if they don't live exactly inside the city. It also provides specific rules for regarding utility boards: a person can serve if they live nearby, own property or a business in the city, use a local utility, and donâ€™t have interests in competing utility companies. This change could help more qualified residents serve on city boards, especially in utility management roles.
