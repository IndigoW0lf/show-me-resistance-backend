summary: |
  This bill changes the existing law about sharing personal information on the internet. It makes it illegal to knowingly post details like names, addresses, Social Security numbers, or phone numbers of individuals if the goal is to threaten, hurt, or intimidate them, or to get financial gain. The law gives tougher penalties when the person posting the information harms or threatens law enforcement officers, judges, or prosecutors, especially if someone is hurt or killed. It aims to protect people from online threats and harassment while increasing punishments for those who misuse personal information online.
