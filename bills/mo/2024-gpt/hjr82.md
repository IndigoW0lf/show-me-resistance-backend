summary_short: "This bill proposes that seniors aged 65 and older with low income in Missouri would not have to pay property taxes."
summary: |
  The bill aims to add a new rule to the Missouri Constitution that would give property tax relief to older adults. Specifically, seniors who are at least 65 years old and have a taxable income of less than $45,000 would not be responsible for paying certain property taxes. This change is intended to help low-income seniors keep their homes without the burden of property taxes, making it easier for them to stay in their communities.
