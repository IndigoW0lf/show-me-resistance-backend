summary: |
  This bill establishes the "Change of Venue for Capital Cases Fund" in Missouri to help pay for expenses that occur when a capital case (a serious criminal case involving the death penalty) is transferred from one county to another. When a case is moved, the county where the case originally started can apply to get reimbursed for costs associated with keeping jurors isolated during the trial. The fund is managed by the office of state courts administrator and has specific rules for how counties can apply for and receive money. This aims to make sure counties aren't financially burdened by the costs of changing the location of major criminal trials that involve the death penalty.
