summary_short: "Allows certain medications in multidose containers to be sent home with patients at hospital discharge."

summary: |
  This bill permits hospitals to send certain types of medications, like inhalers, ointments, and insulin pens, home with patients when they leave the hospital, if a healthcare provider approves. These medications must be properly labeled with information such as the patient's name, medication details, and instructions for use. Controlled substances, like certain pain medications, can only be sent if specific rules are followed, such as necessary for transport and proper documentation. The goal is to help patients continue their medications safely after leaving the hospital without requiring additional licensing for hospitals.
