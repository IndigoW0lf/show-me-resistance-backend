summary_short: "This bill requires cities without counties to report earnings tax data quarterly and clarifies rules on remote work taxes and refunds."
summary: |
  This legislation changes how certain cities in Missouri handle earnings tax reports and collections. Starting September 30, 2024, these cities must produce and publicly post quarterly reports showing total earnings tax collected, broken down by residents' ZIP codes, including refunds and remote work payments. The bill also sets specific rules for taxing remote work, stating that services performed outside the city are not subject to the city's earnings tax unless the remote location is within the city. Additionally, taxpayers will be able to request refunds for earnings taxes paid on remote work done outside the city and may pursue legal action to recover those refunds. The goal is to make earnings tax collection more transparent and ensure fair treatment of remote workers.
