summary: |
  The bill, known as "Jaxx's Law," clarifies that unborn children are not recognized as employees in any civil legal case in Missouri. This affects situations such as wrongful death lawsuits, meaning courts will not treat unborn babies as employees of businesses or government agencies involved in the case. The goal is to specify that unborn children do not have the legal status of employees when civil actions are taken in the state.
