summary_short: "This bill requires all state departments and key government offices in Missouri to be audited at least once every four years."

summary: |
  The bill mandates that every four years, the Missouri state government must have performance audits conducted on all state departments, the legislature, the courts, and other major executive offices like the governor’s office and the state treasurer. These audits are meant to check for cost savings and efficiency improvements. The office in charge of state administration will find independent auditors and make sure audit results are posted on each entity’s website within 30 days. The findings will also be sent to the state legislature. If a government entity refuses to participate in these audits, the attorney general can take legal action against them, but the entity must cover its own legal costs.
