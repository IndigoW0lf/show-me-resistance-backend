summary: |
  This bill updates the laws to make it easier to use statements from children and vulnerable people in criminal cases related to certain crimes, like abuse or exploitation. It allows these statements to be accepted as evidence even if they normally wouldn't be under current rules, as long as a court finds the statements are reliable. The bill also clarifies that recordings of such statements can be used in court if made without witnesses present, under specific conditions. These changes aim to make it simpler to prove cases involving young or vulnerable victims, helping ensure justice for them.
