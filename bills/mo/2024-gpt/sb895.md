summary_short: "This bill limits local eviction bans and requires quick filing of property transfer judgments in Missouri."
summary: |
  This bill makes two main changes in Missouri's landlord-tenant laws. First, it states that local governments, like counties and cities, cannot impose or enforce bans on eviction proceedings unless the state explicitly allows it. Second, it requires that any transfer of ownership of rental properties with existing judgments owed must be filed in court within 30 days. These rules affect landlords, tenants, property owners, and courts by clarifying what local governments can do and speeding up the process of recording property transfers.
