summary: |
  This bill allows taxpayers in Missouri to receive a tax credit equal to 50% of their expenses when they invest in establishing or improving urban farms or small-scale specialty crop farms located in food deserts. Food deserts are areas with limited access to full-service grocery stores, often in poorer urban or rural communities. The program aims to encourage the development of local food sources by providing financial incentives, up to $5,000 per farm and a total cap of $25,000 for all projects. It targets farmers and community organizations working to increase fresh produce availability in underserved areas, supporting healthier food access and urban agriculture.
