summary: |
  This bill requires public schools and charter schools in Missouri to submit financial information, such as bonds issued and expenses, to a state website called the Missouri accountability portal. It also updates rules for how and when different government entities, including school districts and higher education institutions, must report their financial activities. The goal is to make government spending more transparent and accessible to the public by providing a central, easy-to-search online database of financial transactions and obligations.
