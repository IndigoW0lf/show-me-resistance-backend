summary_short: "Allows counties to create flexible payment plans for overdue property taxes and limits tax sales if taxpayers are current on installment agreements."
summary: |
  This bill gives county governments in Missouri the ability to set up installment plans for paying both current and overdue property taxes. It allows taxpayers to pay their delinquent taxes over time, possibly at reduced amounts, and gives the county jurisdiction to decide who can qualify for these plans. If a property owner agrees to pay in installments and stays current, their property cannot be seized to cover unpaid taxes. The bill also makes clear that financial institutions paying taxes from escrow accounts are not affected by these installment provisions.
