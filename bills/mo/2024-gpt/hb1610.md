summary_short: "This bill requires law enforcement and government employees to have a warrant or owner permission before surveilling or entering private property, with some exceptions."
summary: |
  This law states that police and government workers cannot use surveillance equipment or enter private property without a valid search warrant or permission from the property owner or tenant. They can only use surveillance if they have a reasonable suspicion that a crime or regulation violation has occurred. Property owners or tenants have the right to refuse entry unless law enforcement has a proper warrant. However, the rules do not apply in cases related to national security, missing persons, or serious crimes like felonies.
