summary_short: "This bill sets rules for using certain animal processing waste as soil fertilizer and when it must be treated as waste."
summary: |
  This bill changes how animal processing residuals—such as leftover materials from processing animals for food—are managed in Missouri. It states that if these residuals are rich enough in nutrients, they can be used directly as a soil amendment (fertilizer) without needing special permits. However, if they don't meet the nutrient criteria, they must be treated as waste and follow the usual waste disposal laws. The bill also outlines how the Department of Natural Resources will determine nutrient levels and sets rules to ensure proper use and disposal, affecting farmers, food processors, and waste management facilities.
