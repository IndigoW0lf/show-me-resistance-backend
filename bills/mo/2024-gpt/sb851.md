summary: |
  This bill makes changes to Missouri law to clarify and improve how healthcare providers use telemedicineâ€”medical services provided remotely through technology. It requires doctors to establish a proper doctor-patient relationship before offering treatment or prescriptions via telemedicine. This can be done through in-person visits, consultations with other doctors, or certain telemedicine encounters that meet specific standards. The bill also outlines what doctors need to do to ensure safe and effective care, including reviewing medical history, performing examinations, and keeping good records. These requirements apply to all telemedicine practices in Missouri and affect both healthcare providers and patients who receive remote care.
