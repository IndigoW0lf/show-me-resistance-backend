summary: |
  This resolution encourages the U.S. Congress to officially make Puerto Rico the 51st state of the United States. It highlights Puerto Rico's history as a U.S. territory, the lack of voting rights and representation for its residents, and the local preference shown in referendums. The bill aims to help address ongoing issues on the island, especially after natural disasters, and reflects local support for statehood. It calls on Congress to pass a law to make Puerto Rico a full state, which would give residents voting rights and representation in Congress.
