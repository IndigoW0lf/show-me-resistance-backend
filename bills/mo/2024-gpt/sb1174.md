summary_short: "This bill updates the tax credit program to encourage donations to child advocacy organizations, increasing the support available for children's services."

summary: |
  This bill changes the rules for a tax credit that encourages people and businesses to donate to certain child-focused organizations, like CASA and child advocacy centers. It allows donors to get a tax credit worth up to 50% of their donation from 2013 to 2023, and up to 70% starting in 2024. The minimum tax credit you can claim is $50. The total amount of these credits was limited in previous years, but now there is no limit on how much can be claimed going forward. This impacts individuals, businesses, and the organizations that work with children by helping to increase donations that support child welfare and advocacy programs.
