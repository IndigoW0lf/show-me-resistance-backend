summary_short: "This bill allows certain large cities in Missouri to impose a hotel guest tax to fund tourism and community centers, subject to voter approval."
summary: |
  This bill modifies existing law to give bigger cities in Missouri more control over tourist taxes. Specifically, it lets city governments in charter cities with populations over 100,000 in charter counties decide to tax charges for hotel rooms, bed and breakfasts, and campgrounds by 5% to 7%. Before they can do this, they must ask voters in a special election or general election for approval. The money collected from this tax will be used to promote tourism and support community centers. The bill also details how the city can collect and manage this tax, either through city officials or by working with the Missouri Department of Revenue.
