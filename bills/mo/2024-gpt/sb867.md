summary: |
  Starting in 2025, Missouri residents can receive a tax credit for up to 100% of eligible costs related to educating their children outside of the public school system, such as private school tuition, homeschooling fees, textbooks, tutoring, and educational tools. To qualify, the student must be enrolled in a private school or homeschool and the parent or guardian must not have their child enrolled in the local public school district during that year. The tax credit can reduce the amount of state income tax owed, but cannot be more than the state's set educational funding target. This initiative aims to support parents choosing alternative education options while ensuring the credits are used for true educational expenses.
