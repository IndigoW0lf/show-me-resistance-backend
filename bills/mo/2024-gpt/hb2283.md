summary_short: "This bill makes sure that work created by public employees in their official duties cannot be copyrighted, keeping it in the public domain."

summary: |
  This bill, called the "Public Domain Preservation Act," states that any work created by public employees as part of their job—such as laws, court opinions, or official reports—cannot be copyrighted by the government. It means these materials will always be available for anyone to use, share, and reproduce freely. The bill also requires that any published content from state departments or local government agencies clearly indicate if it is in the public domain, and it ensures that works already copyrighted before August 28, 2024, will be placed in the public domain at no cost. Overall, it aims to promote transparency and open access to government-created work.
