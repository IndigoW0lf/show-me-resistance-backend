summary_short: "This bill makes it easier for MO HealthNet participants to get transported between hospitals without needing prior approval."
summary: |
  The bill requires that Medicaid managed care organizations in Missouri do not need to approve in advance ambulance transportation services when a MO HealthNet participant needs to be moved from one hospital to another. This means that patients can be transferred more quickly and easily between hospitals for medical reasons, without waiting for extra approval from their insurance. It aims to improve hospital-to-hospital transfers for those enrolled in MO HealthNet, ensuring faster access to necessary care.
