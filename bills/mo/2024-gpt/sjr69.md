summary: |
  The bill updates the rules for how long members of the Missouri General Assembly can serve. It extends the maximum allowed years from 8 to 12 in each house of the legislature, and from 16 to 24 years overall. This change applies to new members elected after the bill takes effect, and it also allows those who served before December 6, 2024, to count all their previous service toward the new limits. The purpose is to give legislators the opportunity to serve longer while still maintaining some limits on their total time in office.
