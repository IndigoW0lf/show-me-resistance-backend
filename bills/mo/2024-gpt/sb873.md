summary_short: "This bill updates the rules for designating hospitals as trauma, STEMI, or stroke centers in Missouri."
summary: |
  The bill changes the laws about how hospitals in Missouri are officially recognized as specialized emergency care centers. It establishes criteria for hospitals to be designated as trauma, STEMI (heart attack), or stroke centers based on applications and reviews. Some designations may be granted without a review if the hospital is certified by a national organization. Additionally, the bill requires the Department of Health to conduct site reviews of these centers at least every three years to ensure they meet required standards. These updates aim to improve the consistency and quality of emergency care across the state.
