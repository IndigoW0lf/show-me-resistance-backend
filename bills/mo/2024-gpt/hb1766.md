summary: |
  This bill updates the laws in Missouri regarding evidence collection kits used in sexual assault cases. It requires the Department of Public Safety to pay medical providers for forensic exams of victims, with specific rules for consent—minors can consent without a parent or guardian. The bill establishes procedures for handling and transmitting evidence kits, including timely notification to law enforcement and secure storage for up to 30 years if the case isn’t resolved. It also mandates the distribution of evidence kits to medical providers at no cost, ensuring that evidence is gathered properly and preserved over time to support criminal investigations.
