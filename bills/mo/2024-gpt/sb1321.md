summary: |
  This bill updates the laws in Missouri about when and how large water or sewer utilities can purchase smaller ones. It defines what makes a water utility "large" or "small" based on the number of customer connections. If a large utility wants to buy a small utility, they can choose a process that involves independent appraisers to determine the value of the water or sewer system. The appraisers will be appointed by the two parties and the public service commission and will work together to give a fair market value for the system. Their appraisal helps set a fair price for the sale, ensuring transparency and fairness. This bill mainly affects large water utilities, small water utilities, and the public service commission that oversees utility regulations.
