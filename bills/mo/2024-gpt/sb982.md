summary: |
  This bill makes changes to existing laws about water systems. It requires community water providers to regularly test and repair fire hydrants and valves, and to create detailed maps showing their locations. These updates help ensure the water system is well-maintained and reliable. Some larger cities and certain government agencies are not affected by these new rules. The goal is to improve the safety and management of water infrastructure for residents and local governments.
