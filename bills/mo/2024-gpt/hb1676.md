summary_short: "This bill bans Missouri government agencies from accepting or requiring the use of a central bank digital currency."
summary: |
  The bill prohibits all government agencies in Missouri—including local, state, and federal levels operating within the state—from accepting or requiring payment using a central bank digital currency (CBDC). It also prevents these agencies from forcing businesses or private organizations to accept CBDCs. Additionally, the bill stops Missouri government agencies from participating in any testing of CBDCs organized by Federal Reserve branches. The goal is to ensure that government operations do not involve or promote the use of digital currencies issued directly by federal entities.
