summary_short: "This bill updates Missouriâ€™s requirements for high school history courses and assessment systems to improve student evaluation and school performance."  
summary: |
  The bill repeals existing laws about history courses and creates new standards for statewide assessments. It requires the state to develop a flexible, performance-based assessment system that measures students' problem-solving, critical thinking, and knowledge in subjects like history, government, geography, and science. The assessments aim to show what students know and can do, not just memorize facts. Schools can be recognized for high performance and may receive waivers to operate more flexibly if they meet certain criteria for three years in a row, encouraging improved teaching and learning in Missouri high schools.
