summary: |
  This bill requires the Missouri Department of Transportation to put up signs at the city limits of the hometowns of Missouri residents who have received the Congressional Medal of Honor. The signs will include the recipient's name, the year they received the medal, and the words "Congressional Medal of Honor Recipient." These signs will be paid for, put up, and maintained by the department. The purpose is to recognize and honor Missouri heroes, and the department will create rules to make sure the signs are consistent in design and placement.
