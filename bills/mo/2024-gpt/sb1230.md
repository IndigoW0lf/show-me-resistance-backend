summary_short: "This bill limits public access to certain criminal case records in Missouri courts while allowing access for specific officials and in person at courthouses."

summary: |
  The bill amends Missouri law to restrict online access to court records related to specific criminal charges and ordinance violations. These records will not be available to the general public through the statewide court system, except when someone is physically present at a courthouse for that case. However, these records can still be accessed by court staff, law enforcement, judges, prosecutors, the defendantâ€™s lawyer, and other persons authorized by the court. The goal is to protect sensitive information while allowing necessary access for officials and legal professionals.
