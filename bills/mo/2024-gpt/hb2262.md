  This bill requires insurance plans to cap the cost that people with diabetes pay for insulin at $30 for a 30-day supply. It also ensures that the amount they pay is based on the actual price of the insulin after discounts from rebates, which helps lower costs. The bill prevents insurance companies from sharing rebate details publicly or with third parties, protecting trade secrets. Overall, it is designed to make insulin more affordable and keep certain pricing information confidential.
