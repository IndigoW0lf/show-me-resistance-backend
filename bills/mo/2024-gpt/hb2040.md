summary_short: "This bill clarifies that most birth control methods are not considered abortions and restricts abortions to only medical emergencies in Missouri."

summary: |
  This bill changes the way abortion is defined in Missouri law to specify that using hormonal birth control, emergency contraception, or long-acting reversible contraceptives to prevent pregnancy is not considered abortion. It tightens restrictions so that, apart from medical emergencies, no abortions can be performed or induced. The law also clearly states that abortions are only allowed when there's a serious medical emergency that threatens the life or health of the pregnant woman. This bill affects medical providers, women seeking abortions, and healthcare facilities in Missouri by limiting when and how abortions can be legally performed.
