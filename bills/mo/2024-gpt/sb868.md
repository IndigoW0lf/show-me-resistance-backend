summary: |
  This bill, called the "Vulnerable Child Compassion and Protection Act," sets rules for how school employees handle discussions about a student's gender or sexual identity. It prohibits teachers, counselors, and other school staff from encouraging students to adopt a different gender identity or engage in certain sexual relationships. If students express confusion or discomfort about their biological sex, schools must notify the student's parents within 48 hours. The law also states that school staff cannot use a student's name or pronouns unless they have written permission from the parents, ensuring parental control over how a student is addressed. It mainly affects public elementary and secondary schools, their staff, students under 18, and parents or guardians.
