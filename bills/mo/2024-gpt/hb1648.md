summary_short: "This bill creates new programs to reward public employees and school staff for retention and exceptional performance, while also providing schools ways to address staffing shortages."
summary: |
  This bill allows public employers, including school districts, to offer bonuses or incentive payments to employees for staying in their jobs or for achieving outstanding work, as long as these payments follow clear written rules and do not violate state constitutional limits. School districts can also include contracts with individual staff members to provide additional incentives for retention or excellence, with specific criteria approved in advance. Additionally, the bill gives school boards the ability to adjust teacher contracts yearly and offers ways to increase pay for teachers working in hard-to-staff schools or subject areas to help recruit and keep qualified teachers in those challenging roles.
