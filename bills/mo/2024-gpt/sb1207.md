summary: |
  This bill establishes the Work Opportunity Tax Credit in Missouri, allowing employers to claim a tax credit for wages paid to employees from certain targeted groups. Starting in 2025, qualified employers can reduce their state taxes by an amount up to the federal work opportunity tax credit they are eligible for. The bill applies to most types of businesses paying state income taxes and is designed to encourage employment of specific groups that may face barriers to employment. The program will last for six years unless the legislature decides to renew it, and the tax credits are non-refundable and cannot be transferred or sold.
