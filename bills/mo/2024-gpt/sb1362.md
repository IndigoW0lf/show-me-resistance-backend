summary: |
  The bill changes the rules for certain counties in Missouri about reporting their financial information each year. It repeals older laws and creates new requirements for counties in the first four classifications. These counties will need to prepare a financial summary by June 30th that includes details like income, expenses, cash balances, taxes, debt, and elected officials' salaries. The new rules aim to make county financial reports clearer and more consistent, affecting county governments, officials, and residents who want to see how local money is managed.
