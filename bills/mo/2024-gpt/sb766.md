summary_short: "This bill requires private schools to disclose any sexual misconduct allegations against employees and holds them liable if they fail to do so, potentially affecting future employment and legal responsibilities."
summary: |
  This law applies to private schools in Missouri that charge tuition and employ staff who work with children. If a private school receives allegations of sexual misconduct involving an employee and either dismisses the employee or allows them to resign, the school must disclose these allegations to future employers. If they do not, and the employee later harms another student, the school can be held financially responsible for damages and legal costs. This legislation aims to increase transparency and accountability in private schools to protect students from potential harm.
