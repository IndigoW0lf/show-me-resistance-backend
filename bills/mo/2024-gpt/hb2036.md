summary_short: "This bill sets rules for allowing child care facilities to stock and use emergency epinephrine auto-injectors for allergic reactions."
summary: |
  This law updates existing rules to help child care centers handle severe allergies. It allows approved staff at these facilities to obtain, store, and use epinephrine auto-injectors (such as EpiPens) in emergencies. Staff must be trained on how to recognize allergic reactions and properly use the devices. The goal is to improve response times and safety for children experiencing serious allergic reactions, and the law does not apply to public schools. It also ensures proper handling and record-keeping of the auto-injectors to protect children's health.
