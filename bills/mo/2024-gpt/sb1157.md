summary_short: "Public officials removed from office through a quo warranto action will no longer receive retirement benefits for the time they served while in office."

summary: |
  This bill changes the rules about retirement benefits for public officials in Missouri. It states that if a public officer is removed from office through a legal process called a quo warranto, they will not be eligible to receive retirement benefits for the period they served in that office. However, they can still request a refund of their own contributions to the retirement plan. The bill also clarifies that if a public officer commits certain serious crimes, like felonies related to theft, forgery, bribery, or corruption, they will not be able to receive retirement benefits for the time they served. These changes aim to promote accountability by making clear that officials removed for misconduct or criminal activity cannot benefit financially from their service.
