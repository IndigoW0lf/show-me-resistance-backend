summary: |
  This bill updates the laws regarding trials for first-degree murder in Missouri. It sets out specific procedures for cases where the death penalty is not waived or when it is contested. The bill introduces a two-stage trial process: first, deciding whether the defendant is guilty or not, and then, if guilty of first-degree murder, determining the appropriate punishment. During the punishment phase, evidence of aggravating or mitigating factors can be presented, and the judge or jury will decide between life imprisonment without parole or the death penalty. These changes aim to clarify and formalize the trial process, affecting defendants, prosecutors, and courts handling first-degree murder cases.
