summary: |
  This legislation changes the requirements for serving as an election judge in Missouri. It allows active-duty military personnel and their nonresident spouses who move to Missouri to serve as election judges, even if they are not registered voters in the state. The bill also sets rules to prevent election judges from serving at polling places where they or close relatives are on the ballot, with some exceptions for unopposed candidates in certain counties. These updates aim to broaden the pool of qualified election judges and clarify eligibility standards, affecting election officials, military personnel, and political organizations.
