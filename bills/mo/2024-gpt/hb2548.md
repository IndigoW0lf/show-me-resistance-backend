summary_short: "Hospitals with emergency departments must have at least one on-duty doctor available at all times."

summary: |
  This bill requires all hospitals that have emergency departments to always have at least one doctor present and responsible for the emergency area whenever it is open. This means that during all hours the emergency department is operational, a qualified physician must be on-site and on-duty to handle emergencies. The goal is to improve patient safety and ensure proper medical supervision in emergency rooms. This change affects hospital staffing policies and is intended to make emergency care more reliable and effective for patients.
