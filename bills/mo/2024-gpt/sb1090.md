summary_short: "This bill updates Missouri's rules for people who generate their own renewable electricity and use net metering to get credited, making it easier and clearer to connect solar and other renewable systems to the power grid."

summary: |
  This bill, called the "Net Metering and Easy Connection Act," revises existing laws to make it simpler for individuals and small businesses to use renewable energy sources like solar and wind. It allows eligible customers who generate their own power (up to 100 kilowatts) to receive credits on their electricity bills for excess energy they send back to the grid. Utilities must offer net metering on a first-come, first-served basis until these systems reach 5% of the utility's peak electricity use during one hour. The law sets specific safety and technical standards for these systems to ensure safe and reliable operation, and it clarifies the process for interconnecting renewable generators to the electric grid.
