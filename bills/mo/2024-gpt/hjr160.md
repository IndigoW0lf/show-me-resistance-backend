summary: |
  The bill aims to change Missouri's constitution to reaffirm that citizens have the right to keep and bear arms, including accessories, for self-defense, defending homes, or when summoned by law enforcement. It states that any restrictions on these rights must be carefully justified and that the state must protect these rights. Additionally, it allows cities like St. Louis and Kansas City to pass ordinances regulating guns, including issuing permits, charging fees, and setting penalties for violations, while respecting existing permits from other jurisdictions. The bill also provides special exemptions for law enforcement, judges, active military, and certain security personnel. Overall, it affects gun owners, local governments, and law enforcement agencies by clarifying rights and regulation authority.
