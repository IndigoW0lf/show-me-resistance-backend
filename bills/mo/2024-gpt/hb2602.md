summary: |
  This law updates existing rules to hold individuals accountable if they harm vulnerable people, such as the elderly or disabled, and that harm leads to their suicide or suicide attempt. Specifically, if someone abuses these vulnerable individuals and that abuse significantly influences their decision to try or complete suicide, they can be charged with serious crimes like manslaughter or promoting a suicide attempt. The bill aims to address situations where emotional or physical abuse plays a direct role in causing someoneâ€™s death or suicide attempt. It affects caregivers, family members, or others who might harm vulnerable persons in their care or knowing the risks involved.
