summary_short: "This bill allows the state to quickly suspend or restrict massage therapists' licenses if they are facing criminal charges that could harm public safety."
  
summary: |
  The bill gives the licensing board the authority to request immediate suspension or restrictions on a massage therapist's license if the therapist is charged with a crime related to their job, and if there's a concern that the public's health or safety might be at risk. The process involves notifying the licensee quickly, reviewing the case within five days, and holding a formal hearing within 45 to 120 days to decide whether the suspension or restriction should remain in place. This law aims to protect the public by enabling swift action against licensed massage therapists under serious criminal allegations.
