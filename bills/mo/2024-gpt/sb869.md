summary_short: "This law allows courts to issue lifelong protection orders against certain dangerous offenders to protect victims."

summary: |
  This bill lets courts give lifetime protection orders to victims when a person is found guilty of a dangerous felony. These orders prevent the offender from contacting the victim and take effect immediately during sentencing. The orders stay in effect for the offender's lifetime unless the victim dies, the offenderâ€™s conviction is dismissed or overturned, or the victim requests early termination and the court agrees. The order details are shared with law enforcement to help keep the victim safe and ensure the restrictions are enforced over time.
