summary: |
  This bill proposes an amendment to the Missouri Constitution that will change how Jackson County manages property assessments. Instead of having an assessment department that is not elected, the county would be required to have an assessor who is chosen by election. This change aims to increase transparency and voter control over property assessment decisions in Jackson County. The amendment will be decided by voters in Missouri during the next general election or a special election called for this purpose.
