summary_short: "This law limits how city-owned airports can spend revenue, focusing it only on airport and related transportation costs."
summary: |
  The bill applies to city-owned airports that receive federal or state help. It states that the money these airports generate can only be used for costs related to running the airport, maintaining the local airport system, or other local facilities directly connected to air travel. This means revenue cannot be spent on unrelated city services or projects. The goal is to ensure that funds earned from airport operations are used specifically to support airport activities and infrastructure.
