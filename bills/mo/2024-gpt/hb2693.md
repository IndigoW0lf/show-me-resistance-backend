summary: |
  This bill changes the laws about how government bodies in Missouri can get rid of firearms they no longer need or that are involved in crimes. It requires these entities to have official rules in place for taking in firearms, selling them to licensed dealers, and using proceeds from sales. Firearms must be offered for sale publicly before they can be destroyed, and they cannot be destroyed until theyâ€™ve been unsuccessfully offered for sale at least twice. Additionally, if someone is convicted of a crime using a firearm, the court can order that firearm to be sold or traded to a licensed dealer or publicly sold before it is destroyed. These rules are meant to make firearm disposal more transparent and accountable.
