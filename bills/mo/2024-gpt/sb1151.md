summary_short: "This bill updates rules for police use of force, emphasizing de-escalation, transparency, and limits on deadly force."
summary: |
  This bill changes the laws in Missouri regarding how police officers can use force when arresting someone. It states that officers should only use deadly force if there is an immediate threat of serious harm or death, and only after trying less dangerous methods first. The bill also requires police to be trained in de-escalation techniques, to identify themselves before using force if possible, and to give people a chance to submit peacefully to arrest. It bans the use of force in situations like when someone is already restrained, simply arguing, or recording police actions. These changes aim to make police interactions safer and more fair for the public, while also promoting transparency and accountability.
