summary_short: "This bill changes the rules for how Missouri voters can propose and approve constitutional amendments and laws through the initiative process."

summary: |
  The bill updates the procedures for voting on ballot measures in Missouri. It requires initiative petitions proposing amendments to be signed by 8% of voters in two-thirds of the congressional districts, while petitions for laws need only 5%. The bill also sets new timelines for filing petitions and introduces a public review process for proposed measures. Additionally, it specifies restrictions on the types of initiatives that can be used, such as blocking amendments that raise taxes on food or real estate or reduce funding for law enforcement and education. These changes aim to make the ballot measure process more transparent and limited in scope, affecting anyone involved in proposing or reviewing ballot measures.
