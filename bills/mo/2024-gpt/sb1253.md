summary: |
  This bill updates the rules for government purchasing in Missouri. It gives the Commissioner of Administration the authority to hold negotiations after selecting a supplier, especially when bidding is not practical. For contracts over $10,000, the government must choose suppliers through a process called "competitive proposals," which includes advertising, requesting proposals, and evaluating offers to find the best value. For larger purchases over $100,000, the government must advertise publicly, invite proposals, and then select the lowest and most suitable offer, with opportunities for negotiation to improve the bids. This legislation aims to make government contracts more flexible, transparent, and possibly more cost-effective by allowing negotiations and clarifying procedures.
