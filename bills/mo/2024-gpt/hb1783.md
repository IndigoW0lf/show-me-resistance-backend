summary_short: "This bill allows people who are convicted to have their case reopened if new evidence shows they might be innocent."
summary: |
  This bill makes it possible for prosecutors to ask a court to review and possibly overturn a conviction if they discover new evidence suggesting the person was innocent or wrongly convicted. It also allows people currently in prison to file claims of actual innocence during post-conviction legal proceedings. The process involves a court hearing where both sides can present evidence, and the court can vacate or set aside the conviction if clear evidence of innocence or legal errors is found. The bill impacts convicted individuals, the legal system, and promotes fairness by providing another chance to correct wrongful convictions.
