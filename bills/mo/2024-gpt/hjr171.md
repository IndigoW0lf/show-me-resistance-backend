summary: |
  The bill aims to amend Missouriâ€™s constitution to strengthen citizens' right to bear arms, including firearms, ammunition, and related accessories. It states that this right is unalienable and requires strict scrutiny for any restrictions. The bill allows cities like St. Louis and Kansas City to create their own gun laws through local ordinances, including permits, background checks, and penalties. It also clarifies that certain groups, such as law enforcement and active military, are exempt from these local rules. This change will influence gun ownership rights and regulations across Missouri, especially affecting local governments and gun owners.
