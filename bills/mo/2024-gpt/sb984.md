summary: |
  This bill, called the "Intoxicating Cannabinoid Control Act," makes it clear that any potentially intoxicating substances derived from cannabinoids—whether natural, synthetic, or semi-synthetic—are considered the same as marijuana under Missouri law. It requires these products to be regulated by the Department of Health and Senior Services, following the same rules as marijuana, including safety testing, packaging, labeling, and licensing for cultivation and sales. The bill aims to enhance safety and prevent use by children while ensuring these products are properly controlled within the legal framework already established for marijuana. This affects manufacturers, sellers, and consumers of products containing intoxicating cannabinoids in Missouri.
