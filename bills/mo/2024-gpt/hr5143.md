summary: |
  This bill grants the YMCA Youth in Government Program permission to use the Missouri House Chamber and hearing rooms for their two annual state conventions, scheduled on November 15-16 and December 6-7, 2024. These conventions are educational events where high school students participate in mock legislative activities to learn about government processes. The bill also assigns a designated sponsor who will oversee the event and ensure proper conduct. Participants are expected to behave respectfully, dress appropriately, and follow rules that maintain the decorum of the House Chamber, such as no food, drinks, smoking, or unauthorized access to certain areas. This bill mainly affects high school students involved in the YMCA program and the members of the Missouri House of Representatives.
