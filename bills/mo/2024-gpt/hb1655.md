summary: |
  This bill creates a system to list certain violent offenders on a public website. It will include people in Missouri who are on parole or probation for first or second degree murder. The registry provides information such as their names, physical descriptions, addresses, photos, details of their crimes, and current status. The goal is to make it easier for the public to access information about these offenders, while some juvenile offenders are exempt from public notification. This law aims to improve transparency and public safety by clearly sharing information about serious violent offenders.
