summary_short: "This bill updates rules for political donations and campaign spending transparency in Missouri."

summary: |
  This bill changes the laws about how political campaigns handle donations and expenses. It limits the amount of money one person can give to a political campaign to $100 for each contribution. The bill also requires that most campaign expenses over $50 be paid by check, and it sets rules for petty cash use, keeping track of all expenditures. Additionally, it bans anonymous donations over $25 and requires donors and those making payments to disclose their identities. The overall goal is to make campaign funding more transparent and prevent hiding the source of campaign money.
