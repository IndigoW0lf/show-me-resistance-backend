summary: |
  The bill makes changes to how Missouri residents calculate their state income taxes. It adjusts what income items are added back or subtracted to determine taxable income, especially focusing on costs related to research and development activities. These modifications aim to clarify and update the rules around tax refunds, interest on government obligations, and deductions for certain business investments and losses. The goal is to provide clearer guidelines for taxpayers involved in research or with specific types of income or deductions, making it easier for businesses and individuals to comply and potentially benefit from these changes.
