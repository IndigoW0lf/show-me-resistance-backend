summary_short: "This bill proposes a constitutional amendment to strengthen protections and establish penalties for attacking first responders, and to provide death benefits for those killed in the line of duty in Missouri."
summary: |
  This bill suggests changing the Missouri Constitution to make attacking first responders a serious crime, classifying it as a class A felony. It defines who counts as a first responder, including police, firefighters, emergency medical personnel, hospital staff, and National Guard members on duty. If a first responder dies because of an attack or injury incurred while working, their survivors could receive a death benefit of $250,000. The law also sets out how such cases are handled and adds a small court surcharge for related cases. These changes aim to protect those who serve the public and ensure they and their families are supported if they are harmed or killed while doing their duties.
