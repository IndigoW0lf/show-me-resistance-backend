summary_short: "This law requires hospitals to use separate billing identifiers for outpatient departments outside the main campus to ensure transparent healthcare billing."

summary: |
  This bill, called the "Honest Billing Act," changes how certain outpatient hospital services are billed in Missouri. It requires outpatient departments located away from the main hospital campus to have their own unique billing identifier, called an NPI, and to use this identifier when submitting claims to insurance companies. This change helps ensure that charges are transparent and accurately reflect where the services were provided. If hospitals do not follow these rules, they cannot bill patients or insurers for services from off-campus outpatient departments, protecting consumers from confusing or misleading bills.
