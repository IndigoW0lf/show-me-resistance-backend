summary_short: "Allows local governments to set up programs where seniors can volunteer to earn property tax reductions."
summary: |
  This bill lets counties, cities, and other local government entities create programs that help senior citizens reduce their property tax bills. Eligible seniors, who are at least 65 years old and on a fixed income, can volunteer to work for the government or related public entities in exchange for a reduction in their property taxes. The program is designed to assist low-income seniors in staying in their homes by providing an opportunity to offset their tax costs through community service.
