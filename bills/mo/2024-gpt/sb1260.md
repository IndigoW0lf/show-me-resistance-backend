summary_short: "This bill updates laws about prenatal testing for certain diseases to ensure pregnant women are tested and treated appropriately in Missouri."

summary: |
  This bill requires healthcare providers in Missouri to perform specific blood tests on pregnant women during pregnancy, with their consent. The tests check for diseases like syphilis, hepatitis B, hepatitis C, and HIV. If a woman tests positive for these diseases, she will be offered treatment based on current medical practices. Additionally, if the mother has hepatitis B, her newborn will receive vaccinations and immune globulin to protect against the disease. The aim is to improve the health of both mothers and their babies during pregnancy and after birth, ensuring testing and treatment are accessible and follow accepted medical standards.
