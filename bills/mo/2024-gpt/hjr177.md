summary: |
  The bill, HJR177, aims to update the rules for making amendments to Missouri's constitution. It suggests that at the next election in November 2024, voters will decide whether to approve these changes. The proposed changes include reducing the number of signatures needed for initiative petitions proposing amendments from eight to seven percent of registered voters in each of two-thirds of the congressional districts. It also clarifies that the governor's veto power does not apply to measures referred to the people and sets out new procedures for when constitutional measures take effect. These rules will affect voters, political activists, and government officials involved in the amendment process.
