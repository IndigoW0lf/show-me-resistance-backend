summary: |
  The bill makes it a rule that auto repair shops in Missouri must verify that a vehicle's registration is up-to-date before they perform any maintenance or repairs. If a shop repairs a vehicle without confirming its registration status, they can be fined up to $300 per violation. The only exception is when the vehicle is being repaired to meet safety inspection requirements. This bill aims to promote compliance with vehicle registration laws and ensure repairs are done legally.
