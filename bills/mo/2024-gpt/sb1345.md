summary_short: "This bill changes how rejected absentee ballots are handled and gives voters a chance to fix certain issues."
summary: |
  This bill sets new rules for absentee ballots that are rejected during an election. If a ballot is rejected because of issues like missing signatures or incomplete information, the voter will be notified and given a chance to correct the problem by submitting an affidavit and ID before the deadline. The bill also requires election authorities to record when they receive ballots and keep rejected ballot information organized. These changes aim to improve transparency and give voters a fairer opportunity to have their votes counted if their initial ballot is rejected.
