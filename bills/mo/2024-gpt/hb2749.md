summary: |
  This bill updates Missouri law by including xylazine, a drug sometimes used illegally or abused, in the state's list of Schedule III controlled substances. This means that xylazine will now be regulated under stricter laws, similar to other drugs with potential for abuse but some medical uses. The change aims to help prevent illegal use and protect public health. It mainly affects law enforcement, healthcare providers, and individuals who might use or distribute such substances.
