summary: |
  This bill updates Missouri’s rules for two specific tax credits that encourage donations to children’s support organizations. It clarifies the types of organizations that qualify, such as child advocacy groups and crisis care centers, and sets new limits on the total value of these tax credits that can be claimed in each fiscal year. The changes also specify how the tax credits are awarded, verified, and divided among different eligible groups, and aim to ensure the program runs fairly and within set budget limits. These adjustments mainly affect taxpayers who donate to qualifying organizations and the agencies that support children in need.
