summary: |
  The bill stops issuing new permits for landfills and waste disposal facilities in Missouri until there is a new state plan for managing solid waste. It ensures that any new waste sites must go through a public process with public notices and meetings before receiving approval. This impacts companies that want to build or operate waste disposal facilities, as well as local communities and residents who want to be involved in decision-making about waste sites.
