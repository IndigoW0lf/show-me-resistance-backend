summary_short: "This bill encourages child placement agencies to consider a child's or family's religious faith when placing children with caregivers or institutions."
summary: |
  This law revises the rules for placing children in foster care or with caregivers. It states that, whenever possible, the court or child placement agencies should choose caregivers or institutions that share the child's or the parents' religious faith. If the child's faith isn't known or doesn't match the parents', the placement should respect the child's or parents' religious beliefs. The goal is to consider the child's and family's religious preferences during placement whenever practical.
