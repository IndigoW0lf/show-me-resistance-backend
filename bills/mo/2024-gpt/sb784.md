summary_short: "This bill sets a new standard for the minimum amount of time students must be in school in Missouri."
summary: |
  The bill changes the rules for how long schools in Missouri need to be in session. It replaces previous rules with a requirement of at least 1,044 hours of student attendance per year, instead of a set number of school days. This means schools can now schedule their days differently as long as students attend enough hours. It also sets specific attendance and school year length rules for districts in special government areas or large cities. These changes aim to give schools more flexibility while ensuring students get a required amount of instruction.
