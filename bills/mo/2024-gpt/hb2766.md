  The Missouri Homestead Preservation Act sets up a program to help older adults, disabled residents, and certain homeowners keep their property tax savings. It defines who is eligible based on age, disability status, and income limits, whether they own the property individually, with a spouse, or with others. The law specifies how property owners can qualify for protections against significant increases in property taxes, even if their property value rises. This bill impacts property owners in Missouri who meet the criteria, aiming to provide financial stability and protect their homes from sudden tax hikes.
