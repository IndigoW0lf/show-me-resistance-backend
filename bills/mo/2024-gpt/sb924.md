summary: |
  This bill changes Missouri's rules about who can buy and own real estate in the state. Starting August 28, 2024, people who are not U.S. citizens or residents, as well as companies not created under U.S. laws, will generally not be allowed to purchase or own commercial or agricultural land in Missouri. Existing foreign owners before this date can keep their property but cannot transfer it to new foreign buyers afterward. The law also specifies that foreign ownership of agricultural land across the state is limited to no more than 1% of all farmland in Missouri.
