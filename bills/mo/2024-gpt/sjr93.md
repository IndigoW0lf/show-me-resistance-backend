summary_short: "This bill creates stricter laws and penalties for attacking first responders and provides compensation for their families if they are killed in the line of duty."
summary: |
  The bill proposes adding constitutional protections to make assaulting first responders a serious crime called a class A felony, which is one of the harshest offenses. It defines who counts as a first responder, including police officers, firefighters, emergency medical personnel, hospital staff, and National Guard members when on duty. The bill also sets rules for when a first responder is considered "killed in the line of duty," which includes death caused by violence during their work or related activities, with some exceptions. If a first responder dies in the line of duty, their survivors can file a claim for compensation, which will be at least $250,000 starting after December 31, 2024. Additionally, courts will add a $20 surcharge in all criminal cases in Missouri. The goal is to protect first responders from violence and ensure their families receive support if they are killed on the job.
