summary: |
  This bill establishes the Missouri Task Force on Nonprofit Safety and Security, which will study the security needs of nonprofit organizations that face a higher risk of terrorist attacks. The task force will make recommendations on how to manage and fund security measures, such as hiring security personnel and hardening facilities, as well as how to help nonprofits apply for federal grants. It also calls for outreach and education to assist nonprofits, especially first-time applicants, in accessing the grant programs. The bill creates a special fund to store money allocated for nonprofit safety and security efforts. The task force will include various officials and representatives from law enforcement, nonprofit groups, faith-based organizations, and others, meeting regularly to provide annual reports with findings and recommendations. This aims to better protect nonprofits in Missouri and make security resources more accessible.
