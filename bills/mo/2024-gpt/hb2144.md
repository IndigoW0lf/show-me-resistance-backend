summary_short: "This bill changes how the motor fuel tax revenue is distributed to support transportation and local areas in Missouri."
summary: |
  The bill updates the rules for distributing money collected from motor fuel taxes in Missouri. It creates a dedicated Motor Fuel Tax Fund where all fuel tax money is deposited. The funds are then allocated to various programs: some go back to the state highway department, some are refunded for fuel not used on roads, a portion is shared with counties and local governments, and extra funds are added to communities recognized as high tourism destinations based on hotel occupancy rates. The goal is to ensure a fair and clear process for funding transportation projects and local infrastructure, benefiting both state and local communities.
