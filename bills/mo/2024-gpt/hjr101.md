  The bill proposes an amendment to Missouri’s Constitution to clarify and possibly narrow the requirements for voting.

This includes residents over 18 who have registered or have been residents for at least 30 days before an election. The bill also emphasizes that individuals with certain mental incapacity or those convicted of felonies related to voting may be excluded from voting. This change is meant to ensure only qualified citizens can participate in elections.
