summary: |
  This bill changes the laws about home brewing alcohol in Missouri. It states that adults aged 21 and over do not need a license to make alcohol for personal or family use, as long as they do not produce more than 200 gallons per year if there are multiple adults in the household, or 100 gallons if there is only one adult. The brewed alcohol cannot be sold. The bill also allows home brewers to remove their beer from their home for events like tastings or competitions, and to do so on certain licensed premises a limited number of times per year. Additionally, organized events where beer is served and an entry fee is paid are not considered sales if the brewer does not profit and the event follows specific rules. Lastly, homebrewing groups and event hosts will need to carry liability insurance. This bill mainly affects adult home brewers, brewing organizations, and event organizers by clarifying permitted activities and safety requirements.
