summary: |
  The bill authorizes cities and counties in Missouri to establish neighborhood improvement districts dedicated to installing, maintaining, and paying for electric or solar-powered street lights in residential areas. These districts can last up to 20 years, with the possibility of extension. Funding for these street lights comes from assessments on local properties, and the state may provide matching grants to support the costs. A new fund called the Neighborhood Safety and Crime Prevention Street Lighting Fund will be created to hold and manage the money allocated for these projects, which the Department of Economic Development will oversee. The bill aims to improve neighborhood safety and lighting, involving local governments and residents in funding and managing street light projects.
