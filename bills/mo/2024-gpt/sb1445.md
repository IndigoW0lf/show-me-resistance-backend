summary: |
  This bill updates Missouri law to permit healthcare providers to give medication directly to the sexual partners of individuals diagnosed with specific infections like chlamydia and gonorrhea. This practice, known as expedited partner therapy, can be done without the partner needing a medical exam or counseling first. The goal is to help prevent further transmission of these infections. The bill also clarifies that providers who follow this process have legal protection from lawsuits unless they act negligently. It affects healthcare professionals, patients with STIs, and public health efforts to control infections.
