summary: |
  This bill changes the rules in Missouri about spousal support (also called maintenance) after divorce or legal separation. It specifies when a court can grant maintenance, including types like bridge, rehabilitative, or durational support, and sets clear guidelines for who may receive it. The bill emphasizes that spouses have a duty to become self-supporting and that maintenance should not replace employment or be open-ended without limits. It also details the factors courts should consider when deciding maintenance, such as financial resources, employment efforts, marriage duration, and individual circumstances. Further, the bill clarifies that maintenance orders will state if they are temporary or permanent and whether they can be changed if circumstances change.
