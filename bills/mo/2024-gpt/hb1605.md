  This bill changes the laws in Missouri about certificates of need for health care facilities and services. It clarifies what counts as a new project and when a certificate is required based on the amount of money spent. The bill also sets new minimum expenditure amounts for different types of health care projects and updates the definitions used to evaluate proposals. It affects hospitals, long-term care facilities, and other health care providers planning expansions or new services, making the process clearer and potentially easier for some projects to move forward.
