summary_short: "This bill creates a new licensing compact for dentists and dental hygienists to make licensing easier across participating states."

summary: |
  This legislation establishes an agreement, called a compact, that allows dentists and dental hygienists to practice in Missouri and other participating states more easily. It updates existing licensing laws to simplify the process for out-of-state professionals, especially military members and their spouses, who want to work in Missouri. The bill also sets rules for licensing requirements, including for those licensed in other states or military branches, making it easier for qualified professionals to serve the community and address workforce needs.
