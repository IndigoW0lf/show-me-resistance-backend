summary_short: "This bill allows school district employees to also work as members of the Missouri General Assembly without losing their jobs or pay."
summary: |
  The bill amends the Missouri Constitution to specify that teachers, substitute teachers, and notaries public working for school districts can hold positions in the state legislature (the Missouri General Assembly) without having to give up their jobs. Previously, holding certain employment outside the legislature could disqualify someone from serving as a senator or representative. This change ensures that school district employees can serve in the legislature while continuing their work in education, making it easier for educators to participate in state government.
