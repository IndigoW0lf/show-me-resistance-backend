summary_short: "This bill makes certain food purchases exempt from sales tax in Missouri."

summary: |
  The bill changes the law so that most food bought for home consumption is no longer subject to sales tax. Specifically, it exempts food items that can be purchased with food stamps and vending machine food from sales tax. However, food sold for immediate eating at restaurants or caf√©s, which make most of their money from prepared food consumed on-site, will still be taxed. This change aims to make grocery food more affordable for residents by removing sales tax on essential food items.
