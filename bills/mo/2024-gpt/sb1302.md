summary: |
  The bill, called the "Foreign Adversary Divestment Act of 2024," requires Missouri's public funds—such as state retirement funds, local government investment pools, and university endowments—to stop investing in any companies or banks connected to foreign adversaries. It also mandates that these funds begin to sell off any existing investments in these entities, working toward complete divestment. The goal is to prevent public funds from supporting or benefiting from foreign adversaries' companies or banks. This impacts state and local government-managed funds, as well as university endowments, ensuring they do not hold or continue to invest in these restricted entities.
