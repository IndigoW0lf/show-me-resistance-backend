summary_short: "This bill establishes that the City of St. Louis will elect its own city assessor every four years, rather than having an appointed assessor."
summary: |
  This bill changes how the City of St. Louis chooses its city assessor. Starting in 2025, residents will vote in an election to select the city assessor, who will serve a four-year term. This shifts the assessor position from being appointed by the mayor to being an elected role, giving voters more direct control over who manages property assessments in the city. The bill also updates related laws to reflect this new election process. It primarily affects residents of St. Louis, along with current and future city assessors and city government officials.
