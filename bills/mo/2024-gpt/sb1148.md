summary_short: "This bill changes how public defender caseload issues are handled by allowing motions for conferences with judges to address individual workload concerns."
summary: |
  The bill allows a district public defender to ask a judge for a meeting if they believe their caseload prevents them from providing effective legal help to clients. If the judge agrees, they will set a meeting within 30 days to discuss options. After the meeting, the judge can issue orders such as appointing private lawyers, investigating defendants' finances, or adjusting case conditions. This process helps ensure public defenders can better serve their clients by managing caseload problems without affecting the entire office.
