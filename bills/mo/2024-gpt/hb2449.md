summary: |
  The bill, known as HB2449, makes it illegal for landlords to evict military veterans from their rental homes unless the tenants are involved in illegal conduct on the property. A "veteran" is defined as someone who has served honorably in the U.S. Armed Forces, including certain reserve or National Guard members. The law aims to provide additional housing stability for veterans by preventing unjust evictions, ensuring they are only removed if they engage in illegal behavior.
