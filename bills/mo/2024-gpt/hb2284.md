summary_short: "This bill prevents the government from regulating certain personal property uses, like parking or how residents use their homes, in most cases."

summary: |
  This law limits how local governments and the state can control how private property is used. Specifically, it says they cannot create rules or enforce laws about parking unlicensed vehicles on private property, as long as the vehicle is parked fully on the property, on a suitable surface like concrete or asphalt, and supported only by its own wheels, except for limited repairs. It also protects homeowners and renters of single-family homes from rules that unfairly restrict how they can use their homes or parts of their homes, as long as their use does not threaten health or safety. Basically, the bill gives residents more freedom to use their property without government interference, except in certain safety or pollution cases.
