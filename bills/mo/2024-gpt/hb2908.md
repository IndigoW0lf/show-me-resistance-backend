summary_short: "This bill allows counties in Missouri to replace property taxes with an earnings tax if approved by voters."

summary: |
  The bill gives counties in Missouri the option to eliminate their property taxes and instead impose a tax on income and profits earned within the county. This earnings tax can apply to residents' wages and salaries, as well as the income and profits of businesses and non-residents working or operating in the county. To make this change, the county government must propose the switch to voters during an election, and a majority must approve it. If approved, the county will no longer collect property taxes and will instead collect the new earnings tax from residents and businesses.
