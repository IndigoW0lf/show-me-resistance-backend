summary: |
  This resolution from Missouri’s state government asks the United States Congress to quickly renew and update the Radiation Exposure Compensation Act (RECA). The law provides compensation to people affected by nuclear contamination from sites like Weldon Spring, which used to process uranium and caused environmental and health problems. Reauthorizing RECA is important to ensure justice for those who were harmed and to help future generations. It’s a moral step to acknowledge past wrongs and support the communities impacted by nuclear activities.
