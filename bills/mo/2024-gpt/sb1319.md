summary: |
  This bill mandates that both public and private colleges and universities in Missouri that use animals for research must publish an annual report on their websites by December 31st. The report should include details about the research funds spent, the projects ongoing, compliance with animal welfare laws, and efforts to improve animal treatment. It also updates animal cruelty laws, making it a crime to intentionally harm, kill, or neglect animals, with harsher penalties for repeat offenses or acts of torture. These changes aim to promote transparency in animal research and strengthen protections against animal cruelty across the state.
