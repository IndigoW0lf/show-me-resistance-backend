summary_short: "This bill gets rid of the need for most vehicles to have front license plates, allowing only one plate per vehicle."
summary: |
  The bill changes the rules for license plates in Missouri. For most vehicles, only one license plate will be required instead of two, usually the rear plate. This affects passenger cars, commercial vehicles under a certain weight, and other registered motor vehicles. Some specific vehicles, like certain commercial trucks over 12,000 pounds, may still get two plates if requested. The goal is to simplify vehicle registration and reduce the number of license plates needed on vehicles.
