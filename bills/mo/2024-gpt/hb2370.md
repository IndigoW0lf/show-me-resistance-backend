summary: |
  This bill mandates that starting July 1, 2025, all public middle and high schools, as well as eligible charter schools, must supply free period products like tampons and sanitary napkins in their restrooms. The goal is to ensure that students have easy and free access to menstrual supplies, especially in schools serving many students from low-income households. The costs for these products will be covered by state Education Department funds, and the requirement applies to schools and charter schools that serve a significant number of students in need. This law aims to promote student health, comfort, and attendance by removing barriers related to menstrual product access.
