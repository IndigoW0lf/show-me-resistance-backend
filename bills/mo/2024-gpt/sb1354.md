  This bill allows broadband service providers to buy the equipment they use to provide internet and related services without paying sales tax, starting January 1, 2025. It covers a wide range of equipment like cables, antennas, routers, and software that help deliver internet and television services. The goal is to support the expansion and improvement of broadband networks by reducing the costs for providers. Companies providing broadband services will need to give a certificate to sellers to qualify for this exemption, and they may also choose to handle tax payments directly to the state. This measure mainly impacts internet service providers and aims to promote better internet access across Missouri.
