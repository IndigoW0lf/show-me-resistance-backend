summary: |
  The bill is a formal request for Missouriâ€™s congressional representatives to continue funding the Affordable Connectivity Program (ACP). This program helps low-income households access the internet by providing discounts on internet bills and devices like computers and tablets. Many families in Missouri, especially those on tribal lands, benefit from this program, which is crucial for participating in online activities like education, work, and healthcare. The resolution emphasizes that the current funding may be exhausted by spring 2024 and aims to ensure continued support so more Missourians can stay connected.
