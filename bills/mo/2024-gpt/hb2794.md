summary: |
  This bill changes the way Missouri schools help students plan for their futures. It requires students in middle and high school to work with counselors to create a personal plan of study that includes their academic requirements, career goals, and needed experiences. Starting in the 2025-26 school year, students in eighth grade will take career assessments and start developing their plans, with follow-up assessments in tenth grade and annual reviews in high school. The goal is to better prepare students for college, careers, and life after high school, while allowing flexibility for students with disabilities. These rules will affect students, parents, teachers, and school counselors across Missouri.
