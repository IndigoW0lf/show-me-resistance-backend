summary: |
  This bill, called the "Stop the Bleed Act," mandates that all public and charter school classrooms in Missouri be equipped with bleeding control kits. These kits include items like tourniquets, bandages, gloves, and instructional materials to help stop severe bleeding. The law also requires schools to develop a blood loss response plan, place kits in high-traffic or risky areas, and ensure staff members are trained annually on how to use the kits properly. The goal is to improve emergency response for injuries involving heavy bleeding and to keep students and staff safer during emergencies.
