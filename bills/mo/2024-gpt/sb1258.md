summary_short: "This bill exempts certain earnings from taxes in designated economic zones within distressed communities starting in 2024."
summary: |
  This legislation changes Missouri's earnings tax laws to encourage economic growth in specific areas called earnings tax opportunity zones, which are part of distressed communities. Starting January 1, 2024, people working or earning income in these zones—whether through wages, profits, or business activities—will not have to pay earnings tax on certain income. This aims to attract investment and support redevelopment in these communities, benefiting residents and local economies. Local governments in distressed communities will be responsible for maintaining and sharing maps of these designated zones.
