summary_short: "This bill updates the rules for how class actions can be filed and managed in Missouri courts to clarify when they are allowed and how they should be conducted."

summary: |
  This bill modifies Missouri's Supreme Court Rule 52.08 regarding class actions, which are lawsuits brought on behalf of many people with similar claims. It clarifies the conditions under which a group can file a class action, such as having enough members, shared legal questions, and the representative's ability to protect the group's interests. It also specifies when courts can certify these lawsuits, how they must notify potential class members, and how the cases are to be managed. These changes aim to make class actions clearer and more consistent, affecting both plaintiffs and defendants in large-scale legal cases.
