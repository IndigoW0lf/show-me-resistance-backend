summary: |
  This bill updates rules about how school districts share information on school board members, elections, and vacancies. It requires districts to submit details like the names of board members, their term dates, and links to candidate information to election authorities before June 1 each year. The election authorities then report this data to the state and keep it publicly available online. This helps ensure voters and the public have easy access to accurate, up-to-date information about school board elections and leadership changes. The bill affects school districts, election officials, and the Secretary of State's office by establishing clear reporting and transparency measures.
