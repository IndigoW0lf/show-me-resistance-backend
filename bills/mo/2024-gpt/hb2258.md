summary_short: "This bill updates how Missouri's laws handle land acquired by the U.S. government, including clarifying the process for land purchase, condemnation, and management of federal land within the state."

summary: |
  This bill makes changes to Missouri's laws about land that the federal government wants to buy or use within the state. It specifies when and how the U.S. government can acquire land for things like post offices, military buildings, hospitals, and scenic areas, often requiring approval from Missouri's legislature. The bill also clarifies the state's rights to tax land even after the federal government acquires it. Additionally, it defines jurisdiction and management rules for certain federal lands, such as penal farm areas and the Ozark Riverways, and limits applicability to specific watersheds. These updates may affect landowners, government agencies, and local communities involved with federal land use in Missouri.
