summary: |
  This bill makes it illegal for Missouri cities and towns to adopt "sanctuary policies," which are rules that limit or prevent local officials from working with federal agencies on immigration enforcement. It also states that local law enforcement must cooperate with federal immigration laws. Additionally, the bill requires businesses to verify that their employees are authorized to work in the U.S. and prohibits employers from knowingly hiring unauthorized workers. Cities that have sanctuary policies may lose state funding and face fines. The bill aims to strengthen immigration enforcement and ensure cooperation between local authorities and federal immigration agencies.
