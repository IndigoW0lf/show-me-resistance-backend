summary_short: "This bill requires all school districts and charter schools in Missouri to provide early childhood education programs for three- and four-year-olds, with specific enrollment rules and phased implementation over several years."

summary: |
  This bill mandates that every public school district and charter school in Missouri must offer early childhood education programs for three- and four-year-old children. Starting in the 2024-25 school year, a limited number of eligible children (those who qualify for free and reduced-price lunch) can attend these programs and be counted in the school's average daily attendance, but only up to 4% of the total eligible students for that age group. By the 2025-26 school year and beyond, all school districts and charter schools must provide free early childhood programs to all children in that age group who live in the state. The law aims to expand access to early education, helping young children get ready for kindergarten and improving early learning opportunities across Missouri.
