summary_short: "This bill updates rules about on-site sewage disposal systems in Missouri to improve standards and oversight."

summary: |
  The bill revises existing laws related to sewage disposal systems that are built on individual properties. It requires the Department of Health to develop new standards for things like tank size and the layout of sewage lines based on soil types. The bill also sets up a list of qualified soil evaluators, creates a voluntary registration program for contractors who install these systems, and funds training programs for contractors and local officials. These changes aim to make sewage systems safer, more consistent, and better monitored across cities and counties in Missouri.
