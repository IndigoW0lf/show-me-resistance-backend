summary_short: "This bill updates rules about probation lengths and how private agencies can supervise misdemeanor offenders in Missouri."
summary: |
  This bill makes changes to Missouri laws regarding probation. It specifies the maximum lengths of probation for different offenses: one to five years for felonies, up to 18 months for misdemeanors, and up to one year for infractions. The bill also allows courts to extend probation once, by up to one additional year if the person admits to or is found to have violated probation rules. Additionally, it permits certain courts to partner with private agencies to supervise misdemeanor offenders instead of the state division, including rules on drug testing and travel limits for supervised individuals.
