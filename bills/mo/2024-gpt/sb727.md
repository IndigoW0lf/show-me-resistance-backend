summary_short: "This bill allows taxpayers to get a tax credit for donations to educational assistance organizations supporting school scholarships in Missouri."

summary: |
  This bill changes the rules for tax credits related to donations made to organizations that help fund school scholarships for students. If you donate to one of these organizations after August 28, 2021, you can receive a tax credit equal to 100% of your donation, up to 50% of your total Missouri state tax liability. The total amount of tax credits available each year is limited to $75 million, which adjusts for inflation, and these credits can be carried over for up to four years. The bill also sets procedures for how the credits are allocated among organizations, ensuring fair distribution and allowing unused credits to be reallocated. This affects taxpayers who make donations to educational organizations and aims to encourage more support for school scholarships in Missouri.
