summary_short: "This bill updates rules for Missouri school districts on setting start dates and school year requirements to improve transparency and flexibility."
summary: |
  The bill changes how school districts in Missouri decide their opening dates and plan the school year. It allows districts to start school more than 14 days before September if they follow certain public notice procedures, but limits early starts for most districts starting from the 2020-21 school year. It also sets a minimum number of school days and hours students must attend each year, and requires planning for weather-related make-up days. Additionally, the bill addresses funding penalties if districts do not comply with start date rules and allows exceptions in special cases. This affects local school boards, school staff, and families by providing clearer rules and more flexibility in school calendar planning.
