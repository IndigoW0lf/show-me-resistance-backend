summary_short: "This proposed amendment would change Missouri's laws to expand access to health coverage for adults aged 19 to 64 under the MO HealthNet program, depending on state funding."
summary: |
  This bill suggests a constitutional change that would allow more adults, aged 19 to 64, to qualify for health coverage through Missouriâ€™s Medicaid program, known as MO HealthNet. The income eligibility would be based on a specific percentage of the federal poverty level, with eligibility determined each year based on state funding appropriations. If the legislature funds the program for a given year and specifically includes this group in the budget, those individuals would be able to receive health services. This change affects adults who are not currently covered under MO HealthNet and aims to improve access to healthcare, depending on how the state appropriates funds each year.
