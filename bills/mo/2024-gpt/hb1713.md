summary: |
  This bill updates Missouri's tax rules to make it easier for members of the armed forces to deduct their military income from their state taxes. Starting in 2016, active-duty military members can subtract 100% of their salary, including signing bonuses, from their Missouri taxable income. Beginning in 2020, members of the National Guard and reserve units can also claim deductions for a portion of their military pay, with the amount increasing each year until it reaches 100% in 2024 and later. These changes mainly aim to provide financial relief to service members by reducing their state income tax burden. The law does not apply to military pay received while performing civilian federal jobs or civil service positions.
