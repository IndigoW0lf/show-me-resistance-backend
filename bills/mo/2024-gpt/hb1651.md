summary: |
  This legislation, known as the "Anti-Red Flag Gun Seizure Act," prevents Missouri state and local law enforcement agencies from enforcing any federal or state laws, orders, or measures that remove firearms from individuals without a court trial, known as red flag laws. It also bans state agencies from using federal funds to carry out such laws and makes it illegal for any state or local officer to enforce them. Officers or agencies that try to enforce red flag laws could face civil penalties, including fines. This bill mainly aims to protect Missouri residents' gun rights and limit federal and state actions that involve seizing firearms without proper legal procedures.
