summary_short: "This bill proposes a constitutional change to enhance gun rights and allow local governments to regulate firearm possession through ordinances."
summary: |
  The bill recommends a new constitutional amendment for Missouri voters to decide on in 2024, which would replace the current gun rights language with a broader guarantee of the right to keep and bear arms. It states that this right is unchangeable and cannot be questioned, while still allowing laws to restrict firearm access for violent offenders or those deemed a danger due to mental health issues. Additionally, it grants cities and counties the authority to create local ordinances to regulate firearms, including issuing permits, setting fees, and establishing penalties, with certain exemptions for law enforcement, judges, military, and security personnel. This bill affects gun owners, law enforcement, local governments, and residents across Missouri.
