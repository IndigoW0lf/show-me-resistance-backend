summary: |
  This bill, known as the Missouri Covenant Marriage Act, establishes a new process for couples to choose a special kind of marriage called a covenant marriage. To enter into this type of marriage, couples must sign a declaration of their intent, which includes a statement of their commitment to stay married for life and their understanding of the marriage's seriousness. They also must attend premarital counseling and sign an affidavit confirming they received counseling about the lifelong commitment and legal obligations. The bill offers couples the option to obtain a covenant marriage license, which is recognized equally with a standard marriage license by all government agencies. This law aims to promote more committed marriages and encourages couples to seek counseling if they face difficulties.
