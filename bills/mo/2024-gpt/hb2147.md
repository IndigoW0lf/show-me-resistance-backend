summary_short: "This bill updates Missouri's statewide student assessment system to focus on performance-based testing and provide more local flexibility."
summary: |
  The bill revises the rules for how Missouri evaluates student performance in public schools. It shifts the focus toward performance-based assessments that measure skills like problem-solving, creativity, and application, rather than just memorization. The new system aims to give local schools more flexibility in how they assess and demonstrate student learning. It also sets standards for recognizing schools that excel at helping students learn and proposes ways for high-performing schools to earn special waivers. These changes will affect students, teachers, and school administrators across the state by updating testing methods and accountability measures.
