summary_short: "Allows students to attend multiple public summer school programs in different districts without attending more than one at the same time."
summary: |
  This bill changes the rules for summer school attendance in Missouri. It allows students to enroll in summer programs in more than one public school district, as long as they do not attend classes concurrently in multiple districts. When a student attends a summer program outside their home district, the district they are attending considers the student a resident for funding and aid purposes. This helps families and students access more summer educational options and encourages districts to work together to share resources. The bill affects students, school districts, and state funding policies for summer education.
