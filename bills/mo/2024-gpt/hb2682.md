summary_short: "This bill changes how juvenile court records and information about offenses are kept confidential and who can access them, especially regarding serious crimes and weapons."
summary: |
  This bill updates laws about juvenile court records to improve privacy and clarify who can see certain information. It specifies that most juvenile court records, including social and official records, are generally not open to the public unless the court grants permission. However, records related to serious crimes like murder, kidnapping, or sexual assault will still be kept more confidential to protect the juvenile's privacy. The bill also allows juvenile officers to share some information with specific people involved in the child's case, like victims, law enforcement, or treatment providers, but not with the general public. These changes affect the procedures for handling juvenile court records and who has access to sensitive information.
