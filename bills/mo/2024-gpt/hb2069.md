summary: |
  The bill changes the way Missouri distributes funds to regional planning commissions. It requires the state to match half of the local funds provided by each commission, with specific maximum amounts allocated to certain regions. Starting July 1, 2026, the funding amounts will be adjusted each year based on the consumer price index. This affects the regional planning groups that work on local development and planning projects across the state.
