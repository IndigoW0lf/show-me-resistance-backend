summary: |
  This bill changes the state's rules about renewable energy. It requires electric utilities to gradually increase the amount of electricity they generate or purchase from renewable sources like wind, solar, and hydro. By specific future dates, utilities will need to meet higher minimum percentagesâ€”starting with 15% and reaching 100% by 2059. The bill also makes sure that at least 2% of the energy comes from solar power. It affects utility companies, energy producers, and regulators by setting standards for clean energy use and creating a system for tracking renewable energy credits.
