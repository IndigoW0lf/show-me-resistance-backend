summary_short: "This bill proposes a constitutional change to exempt certain disabled veterans and related properties from property taxes in Missouri."
summary: |
  The bill, known as SJR 58, sets the stage for a future vote by Missouri voters to amend the state constitution. If approved, this change would make specific types of property owned by disabled veterans and certain other groups exempt from property taxes. It applies to real estate used as a homestead by disabled veterans, former prisoners of war, and certain nonprofit organizations like religious, educational, or charitable groups. The legislation also includes provisions to compensate local governments for the revenue lost due to these exemptions, ensuring they continue to receive necessary funding. The goal is to provide financial relief to disabled veterans and other approved entities while maintaining the state's overall tax revenue balance.
