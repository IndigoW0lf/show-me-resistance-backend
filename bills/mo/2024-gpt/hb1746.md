summary: |
  This bill changes the rules for how solar energy projects are taxed in Missouri. Starting January 1, 2025, the stateâ€™s assessors will determine the value of solar energy properties, but small or older projects built before December 31, 2024, are considered to have little to no value for tax purposes. For projects built before that date, property taxes will not exceed $500 per megawatt. The bill also clarifies legal rules about property taxes related to utilities and ensures that certain tax exemptions remain in place. Overall, it aims to make solar energy property taxes more consistent and to clarify existing utility-related property tax laws in the state.
