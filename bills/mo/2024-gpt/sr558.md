summary_short: "This bill changes the rules for how amendments to state appropriations bills can be made, especially those that increase or decrease spending."

summary: |
  This bill clarifies and tightens the process for amending state budget bills. It states that amendments cannot go beyond the second level of change to an original bill. For appropriations bills, any amendment that increases total spending must be balanced by a corresponding decrease to ensure total appropriations stay the same. The bill also sets rules for how amendments that offset each other's changes are considered and requires that all amendments be properly documented and printed before final approval. It affects Senators, legislative staff, and those involved in budget planning and approval.
