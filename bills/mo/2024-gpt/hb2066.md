summary_short: "This bill updates laws about the sale and handling of catalytic converters and other vehicle parts to improve regulation and prevent illegal activity."
summary: |
  This bill makes changes to existing laws related to vehicle parts, especially catalytic converters. It requires certain businesses, like salvage yards and rebuilders, to get licenses and keep detailed records of their sales, including who is buying salvage vehicles and parts. The bill also sets rules for stamping titles to indicate that vehicles are for export only, helping to prevent theft and illegal resale. These regulations aim to increase transparency, track the movement of catalytic converters, and reduce crime involving vehicle parts. Anyone involved in salvaging, dismantling, or selling vehicle parts or scrap metal will be affected by these new rules.
