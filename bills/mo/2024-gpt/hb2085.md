summary_short: "This bill creates a one-year window for people to set up payment plans for unpaid vehicle sales taxes in Missouri."

summary: |
  This bill allows vehicle owners in Missouri to apply for payment plans to settle unpaid sales taxes on cars, boats, trailers, and outboard motors. The one-time, one-year period gives people a chance to pay their owed taxes over time instead of all at once. It affects vehicle buyers, sellers, and leasing companies who may have unpaid sales taxes. The law also updates procedures for issuing vehicle titles to show whether sales tax has been paid or if the vehicle is exempt.
