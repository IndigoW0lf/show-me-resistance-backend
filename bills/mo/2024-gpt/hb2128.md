summary_short: "This bill allows certain long-serving, elderly prisoners to have a parole hearing after 30 years of incarceration."

summary: |
  This bill changes the rules for parole eligibility for some prisoners in Missouri. Specifically, it applies to offenders who are serving very long sentences, including life sentences of at least 50 years, for crimes committed before October 1, 1984. To qualify, the offender must be 60 or older, have no prior convictions for dangerous felonies, and not be a sex offender. If these conditions are met, they can request a parole hearing after serving 30 years. The parole board then reviews whether they are likely to live and follow the law if released, considering factors like good behavior, self-rehabilitation, community support, and risk scores. If parole is granted, the offender will be supervised for at least five years after release. This bill aims to provide some elderly, non-violent offenders a chance for early parole based on their rehabilitation and circumstances.
