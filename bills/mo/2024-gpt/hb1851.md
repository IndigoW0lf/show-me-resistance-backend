summary: |
  This bill changes the regulations around the statewide assessment system for public schools in Missouri. It requires the State Board of Education to create up to 75 academic performance standards that help guide what students should learn and achieve in areas like reading, math, science, and history. The bill also details how work groups of education professionals should be formed to develop and review these standards, ensuring a diverse and qualified team includes teachers, parents, and experts. These standards aim to support schools in providing engaging curricula, preparing students for high school graduation, and preparing them for college or careers. The changes will affect the state's education policies and how schools plan and assess student progress.
