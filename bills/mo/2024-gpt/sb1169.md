summary_short: "This bill updates the jury instructions and trial process for first-degree murder cases in Missouri, especially regarding the death penalty and sentencing procedures."

summary: |
  This bill changes how first-degree murder cases are handled in Missouri courts. When a case involves first-degree murder and the death penalty, the trial is now split into two stages: first to determine guilt, and then to decide on the punishment if guilt is established. If the death penalty is not waived or if the defendant is convicted of a lesser charge, the court will proceed with the appropriate sentencing process. The bill also outlines rules for presenting evidence related to punishment, including aggravating and mitigating factors, and specifies circumstances under which the death penalty can be imposed or avoided. Overall, it affects criminal defendants, victims' families, attorneys, and judges involved in serious homicide cases.
