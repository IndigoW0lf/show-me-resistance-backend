summary_short: "This bill requires law enforcement agencies to report data on use of force, complaints, and officer contacts to increase transparency and accountability."

summary: |
  This bill mandates that law enforcement agencies in Missouri regularly report detailed information about their activities, including use of force incidents, complaints from the public, and officer contacts. Starting January 1, 2025, agencies must submit data on events such as shootings or injuries caused during police actions, officersâ€™ interactions with the public, and any resignations while under investigation. The POST commission will create a database to store complaints and analyze patterns of officer behavior, helping to evaluate training effectiveness and identify potential misconduct. These measures aim to increase transparency, improve police accountability, and build public trust by providing clearer insights into law enforcement practices.
