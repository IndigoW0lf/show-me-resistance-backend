summary_short: "This bill allows eligible vehicles in Missouri to be registered permanently instead of annually by paying a one-time fee."
summary: |
  The bill lets vehicle owners in Missouri choose to register their vehicle permanently rather than renewing registration every year. To do this, they pay a fee that is seven times the usual annual registration cost. Once registered permanently, the vehicle will get special plates, and the registration is tied specifically to that vehicle. If the vehicle is sold, the permanent registration and plates are canceled and must be returned. This change impacts vehicle owners, DMV procedures, and the way vehicle registration fees are handled, making vehicle ownership simpler for those who opt for permanent registration.
