summary_short: "This bill updates the trial procedures for first-degree murder cases, including how guilt and punishment are decided."
summary: |
  This bill changes how first-degree murder cases are handled in court. If the defendant faces the death penalty, the trial is split into two parts: one to decide if they are guilty, and another to determine the punishment. If the death penalty is not being sought or is waived, the case proceeds like other criminal trials. The bill also specifies what evidence can be presented during the sentencing phase and clarifies how the judge or jury will decide between life imprisonment and other punishments, including considering the defendant's mental ability and circumstances of the crime. These changes aim to improve clarity and fairness in murder trials affecting defendants, victims' families, and legal practitioners.
