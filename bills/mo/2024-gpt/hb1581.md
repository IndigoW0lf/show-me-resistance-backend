summary_short: "This bill bans the use of corporal punishment in Missouri schools and sets policies for discipline and reporting school violence."
summary: |
  This legislation requires all school districts in Missouri to have a written discipline policy that explicitly prohibits the use of corporal punishment and spanking. The policies must be shared with students and their parents at the start of each school year and be available for public viewing. Schools are also required to report acts of serious violence to staff and law enforcement quickly, especially crimes that could involve dangerous behavior like assault or robbery. The bill affects students, parents, teachers, and school administrators by establishing clear rules about discipline and violence reporting to improve safety and transparency in schools.
