summary: |
  This legislation, called the Firearm Violence Prevention Act, introduces measures to reduce gun-related injuries and deaths in Missouri. It allows courts to issue temporary or ongoing extreme risk protection orders (ERPOs) that can result in the temporary removal of firearms from individuals deemed to be a danger to themselves or others. The bill also updates search and seizure rules, especially concerning firearms and related evidence, making it easier for law enforcement to act in certain cases, such as when a person is subject to an ERPO or a felony arrest warrant. The law affects gun owners, law enforcement agencies, and courts by establishing new procedures for firearm removal and evidence collection to promote public safety.
