summary: |
  This bill, HB2175, aims to ensure that Missouri maintains control over health care decisions related to abortion by restricting the ways federal laws and regulations can affect state policies. It affirms that federal rules cannot force the state or its public employees to perform or fund abortion services, and it promotes encouraging childbirth over abortion using public funds. The bill also prevents federal government actions from coercing Missouri into supporting abortion-related activities and prohibits public money from being spent at abortion clinics or their affiliates. Additionally, it clarifies the rules for health care payments, such as those for hospital services under the MO HealthNet program, while reinforcing protections for religious and moral beliefs. Overall, the bill affects state health care policies, public funding, and individuals and organizations involved in health services and abortion care in Missouri.
