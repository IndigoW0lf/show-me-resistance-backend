summary: |  
  This bill, called HB2242, requires the Secretary of State in Missouri to create a process for automatically registering eligible voters. When people complete specific actions—such as renewing a driver’s license, applying for social services, registering for college, or getting unemployment benefits—their information can be automatically updated to include them on the voter registration list. Local election officials will receive lists of these suggested registrations and will notify individuals, giving them a chance to decline registration if they wish. The goal is to make it easier for eligible citizens to register to vote and stay registered without extra steps, while still giving them control over whether they are added.
