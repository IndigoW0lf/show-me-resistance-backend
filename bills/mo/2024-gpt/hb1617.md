summary: |
  This bill changes the laws about when survivors of childhood sexual abuse can sue for damages. It now allows victims to bring legal action up to 20 years after they turn 21 years old or within three years of discovering that their injury or illness was caused by the abuseâ€”whichever time period is longer. Previously, the deadline was only 10 years after turning 21. The bill applies to abuse that happened in Missouri and will take effect for cases starting on or after August 28, 2024. It affects anyone who was abused as a child and wants to seek justice through a civil lawsuit.
