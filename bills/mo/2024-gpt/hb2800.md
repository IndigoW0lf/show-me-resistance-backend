summary: |
  The bill requires original motorcycle manufacturers to make repair documents, tools, and parts available to independent repair shops and owners at fair and reasonable terms. This means owners and independent repair shops will be able to get the same access to repair information and parts as official authorized repair services. The goal is to promote fair competition and empower consumers by making repairs more accessible and affordable. It affects motorcycle owners, repair shops, and manufacturers by establishing transparent and fair repair practices.
