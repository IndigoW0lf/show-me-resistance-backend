summary_short: "This bill updates the rules for transferring core college courses across Missouri public higher education institutions to make transfer easier and ensure consistent credit recognition."
summary: |
  This bill modifies existing laws to create a standardized core curriculum of 60 credit hours for Missouri public colleges and universities. It requires the coordination board to develop recommended courses and a common numbering system to help students transfer credits more smoothly between schools. Once implemented, students who complete this core at one institution can transfer and have their credits accepted at any other public college or university in the state, reducing duplication and saving time. The bill affects students, faculty, and institutions of higher education across Missouri by making transfer processes clearer and more consistent.
