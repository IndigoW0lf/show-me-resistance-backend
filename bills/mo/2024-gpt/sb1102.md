summary_short: "This bill limits the out-of-pocket costs for people with advanced stage cancer under their health insurance plans."

summary: |
  The bill, called the Missouri Advanced Stage Cancer Cost Burden Cap, makes it illegal for health insurance plans to charge extra costs like copayments or coinsurance for treating advanced stage cancer. Patients with this serious form of cancer will only need to pay their usual deductible, just as they would for other health services. This helps reduce the financial burden on patients who are battling advanced cancer, making treatment more affordable and easier to access.
