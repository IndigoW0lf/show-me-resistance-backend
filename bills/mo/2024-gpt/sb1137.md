summary_short: "This bill updates when certain child homes and foster facilities need to be licensed in Missouri."
summary: |
  The bill changes the rules about licensing for homes that care for children. It removes some older exemptions, meaning more types of child care homes may now need to be licensed by the state. Specifically, it clarifies which homes are not required to have a license, such as homes operated by religious organizations or those providing short-term, free care for friends' children. The goal is to ensure proper oversight while allowing certain organizations to operate without licensure if they meet specific criteria.
