summary: |
  This bill sets clear rules to ensure parents have a say in their child's special education plans. Schools must get written permission from parents before changing or removing services for students with disabilities. Parents can visit classrooms and review proposed plans before agreeing. The law also requires the Department of Elementary and Secondary Education to provide a standardized consent form in parents' native languages. Overall, these changes give parents more control and transparency over their child's education, especially when it involves special needs services.
