summary: |
  This bill updates Missouri’s health insurance laws to specify that, when calculating how much enrollees have paid toward their out-of-pocket maximums or other cost-sharing limits, health plans must include all payments for medications, even if there isn’t a generic version available. It also clarifies how these rules apply to high-deductible health plans and health savings accounts, ensuring that certain cost-sharing counts toward savings and tax benefits. Additionally, the bill states that these changes do not prevent insurers from using step therapy, a process that requires trying certain medications before others. Overall, the bill affects health insurance companies, enrollees, and pharmacy benefit managers by making the calculation of out-of-pocket costs more transparent and comprehensive.
