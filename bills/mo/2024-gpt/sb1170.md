summary_short: "This bill protects students' free speech and association rights at state-funded colleges and universities in Missouri."
summary: |
  This bill, called the College Student Free Speech and Association Act, ensures that students attending public or state-funded colleges and universities in Missouri cannot be barred or punished for participating in protected speech or groups. Institutions must review their policies to confirm they do not unfairly limit students' free speech rights, and they must disclose whether they guarantee these rights. The bill also allows institutions to discipline students for disruptive behavior during speeches or classes and recognizes efforts to prevent issues like alcohol abuse and harassment. It affects both public institutions and private colleges that receive state funds, making sure students' rights are respected without undermining safety or order on campus.
