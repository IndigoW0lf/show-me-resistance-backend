summary_short: "This bill makes changes to how prescription drug payments are handled to ensure patients have more choice and transparency."
summary: |
  This bill updates laws in Missouri to give patients more control over where they get their prescription drugs and how they pay for them. It clarifies that pharmacies and pharmacists can provide advice and that patients can choose any licensed pharmacy they prefer, either by bringing a written prescription or electronically transmitting it. The bill also prevents pharmacy benefits managers from making contracts that force patients to pay more than they should at the point of sale, based on copayments or cash prices. Additionally, pharmacies have the right to inform patients about their costs without interference, helping consumers make informed choices about their prescriptions.
