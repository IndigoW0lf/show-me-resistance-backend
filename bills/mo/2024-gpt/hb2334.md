summary: |
  This bill, known as HB2334, prevents schools in Missouri from hiring collection agencies to collect money owed for student meals. This means if a student or family owes money for school meals, the school cannot turn to outside companies to get that money. The bill applies to public, private, religious, and charter schools that participate in federal meal programs. Its goal is to protect families from aggressive debt collection practices related to school meals.
