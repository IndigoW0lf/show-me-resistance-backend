summary_short: "This bill gives parents more rights to access and review their child's school records, materials, and information about school activities in Missouri."
summary: |
  The bill, called the "Parents' Bill of Rights Act of 2024," ensures that parents or guardians can quickly access important information about their children’s education. It allows them to see classroom materials, learn who teaches their children, and view details about school funding and contracts—all within two business days of request. Parents can also review their child's education and health records, as well as information related to safety and school events, as long as privacy laws are followed. The bill makes it clear that schools cannot require parents to sign non-disclosure agreements to see curriculum materials and must provide nonproprietary curricula in accessible formats. It is intended to promote transparency and enable parents to be more involved in their children's education.
