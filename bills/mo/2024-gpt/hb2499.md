summary: |
  This bill changes the eligibility rules for Missouri's A+ Schools Program, which provides grants to high schools. The goal is to make sure all students graduate, complete challenging coursework, and are prepared for college, vocational training, or good jobs. Schools must set clear performance standards, offer rigorous courses, and work with community partners and businesses to support students. Nonpublic schools can also apply to participate if they meet the same requirements, helping more students qualify for postsecondary financial aid.
