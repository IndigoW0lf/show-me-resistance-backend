summary: |
  The "Employment Security and Job Referrals Act of 2024" requires the Missouri Department of Labor to create a system that shares available job openings directly with people collecting unemployment benefits. It will also refer these claimants to appropriate job opportunities, help them connect with employers, and monitor their responsiveness. The goal is to improve employment chances for those out of work, ensuring they receive support to find suitable jobs more efficiently. This law affects unemployment benefit recipients and the departments responsible for employment services, starting from January 1, 2025.
