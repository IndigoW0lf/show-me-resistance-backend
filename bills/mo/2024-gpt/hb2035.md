summary_short: "The PRAISE Act prevents the government from closing or restricting places of worship during emergencies, except in cases of immediate danger."
summary: |
  This bill, called the PRAISE Act, ensures that during a state of emergency, places of worship such as churches, mosques, temples, and synagogues cannot be shut down or made unable to hold religious services. The law applies to state and local government actions, but there are some exceptions for emergencies like natural disasters or threats where people are in immediate danger. If a government entity wrongly restricts religious services during an emergency, affected religious groups can file a lawsuit to seek damages or orders to stop the violation. The bill aims to protect religious freedom during critical situations while allowing for safety measures when necessary.
