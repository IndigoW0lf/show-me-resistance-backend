  This bill makes changes to Missouri's laws regarding crimes committed while operating vehicles and vessels. It defines new categories for repeat offenders, such as "aggravated" and "chronic" offenders, based on the number of intoxication-related offenses. The law applies to both motor vehicles and boats, and it establishes clear definitions for these offenses. The goal is to enhance penalties and improve public safety for drivers, boaters, and the general community.
