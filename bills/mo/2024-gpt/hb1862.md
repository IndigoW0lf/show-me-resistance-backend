summary: |
  This bill updates the rules for how the state’s utility regulatory commission calculates the fees it charges to utility companies like electricity, water, and gas providers. It sets limits on the total amount the commission can collect from these companies, starting at 0.315% of their gross revenues and gradually increasing to 0.5% over several years. The bill also details how the commission estimates and allocates costs among different types of utilities and requires utilities to account for differences between actual assessments and those used to set their rates. Overall, it affects utility companies’ costs and how those costs are managed and recovered through customer rates.
