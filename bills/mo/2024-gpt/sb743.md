summary_short: "This bill updates funding rules for early childhood education programs to include certain preschool kids for more resources."
summary: |
  This bill changes the way Missouri funds early childhood education programs by including three- and four-year-old children who qualify for free and reduced-price lunch and attend approved preschool programs. It allows these children to be counted in their school districtâ€™s or charter school's average daily attendance, which can increase the funding they receive. The bill also specifies how districts can fill vacant spots if a child leaves during the year and ensures that these changes won't reduce other types of state aid. Overall, it aims to support more young children in early education and ensure they are considered in school funding calculations.
