summary: |
  The bill, titled HJR85, makes a change to the Missouri Constitution so that starting January 1, 2025, certain seniors and disabled individuals will pay only half of the usual property tax on their homes. To qualify, the person must be at least 65 years old or permanently disabled, and have a household income of $50,000 or less if single, or $75,000 or less if married and filing jointly. This benefit aims to make property taxes more affordable for low-income seniors and disabled persons. The change applies to residential properties they own and helps reduce their financial burden.
