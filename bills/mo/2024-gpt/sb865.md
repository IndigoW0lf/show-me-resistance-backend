summary_short: "This bill restricts how foreign ownership of property can receive state benefits and requires disclosure of large gifts from foreign entities to universities."

summary: |
  This bill changes the laws around foreign ownership of property in Missouri. It prevents state agencies from offering any public benefits, like grants or tax credits, to properties owned by foreign entities. It also defines who counts as a foreign government, legal entity, or person, and sets rules for universities to report large gifts from foreign sourcesâ€”specifically, gifts worth $100,000 or more. If a foreign organization or individual gives a large gift to a university, the university must report it to the state, especially if it has conditions that could violate laws about discrimination. These rules aim to increase transparency about foreign involvement and ensure compliance with state and federal laws.
