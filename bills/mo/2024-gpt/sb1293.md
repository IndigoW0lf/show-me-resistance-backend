summary: |
  The bill, called the "Uniform Public Expression Protection Act," sets rules for dismissing legal cases that are based on what someone says or does in public, especially when discussing government proceedings or public issues. It mainly applies to civil lawsuits where a personâ€™s speech or expression is related to public concerns or government actions. There are some exceptions, such as cases involving government officials acting in their official capacity or lawsuits related to selling goods or services. The law also gives people a way to quickly ask courts to dismiss inappropriate lawsuits, helping protect free speech rights and reducing unnecessary legal burdens.
