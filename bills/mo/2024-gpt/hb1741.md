summary_short: "This bill grants legal protection from lawsuits to charities and religious groups when they share allegations of sexual misconduct with each other."

summary: |
  This law makes it so that charities, nonprofits, religious organizations, and churches cannot be sued for sharing information about someone accused of sexual misconduct, abuse, harassment, or related offenses, as long as the information was properly reported under existing child abuse laws. It encourages these groups to communicate openly about serious misconduct without fear of being sued. However, individuals who disclose their own misconduct or share false or malicious accusations still remain liable. The law applies specifically to reports that were previously made to child protection authorities and is intended to protect organizations that responsibly share such information.
