summary: |
  This bill makes changes to the laws regarding certified registered nurse anesthetists (CRNAs) in Missouri. It states that CRNAs can order and give controlled substances, such as certain pain medications, when providing anesthesia for surgeries or medical procedures. Importantly, CRNAs are not required to enter into collaborative practice agreements with doctors, dentists, or podiatrists, nor do they need a separate prescriptive authority from the state. The bill also updates rules about other healthcare providers' ability to prescribe controlled substances and clarifies that veterinarians can prescribe controlled drugs in the course of their veterinary practice. These changes aim to streamline the role of CRNAs and expand their ability to provide anesthesia-related care efficiently.
