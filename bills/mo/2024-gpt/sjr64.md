summary_short: "This bill lets crime victims file a civil lawsuit within the same time limit as the criminal case against the offender."
summary: |
  This legislation changes the Missouri Constitution to give crime victims the right to sue the person who harmed them, within the same time period allowed for prosecuting the criminal case. It also confirms victims' rights to be informed, present at hearings, seek restitution, and be protected during criminal proceedings. The bill does not create a cause of action for damages against the state or its agencies, and courts cannot overturn criminal guilt findings. Overall, it enhances victims' ability to seek justice and participate in the legal process.
