summary: |
  This bill allows certain corporations that have contracts with the state to provide dental care in correctional centers to avoid the usual licensing requirements for practicing dentistry. It clarifies that hospitals can employ licensed dentists, oral surgeons, and prosthodontists to treat patients with specific dental and oral health issues, especially those related to treating complex conditions or surgeries. It also establishes rules about who can practice dentistry or dental hygiene in Missouri, including exceptions for students, licensed professionals, and certain health practitioners. Overall, the bill aims to make it easier for qualified dental providers working under these contracts to deliver care without the need for separate licensure, affecting both healthcare providers and incarcerated individuals receiving dental services.
