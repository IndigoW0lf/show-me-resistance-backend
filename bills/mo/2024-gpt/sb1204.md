summary_short: "This law requires electric utilities in Missouri to reimburse customers for certain losses caused by long power outages."

summary: |
  This bill helps protect Missouri electricity customers by requiring electric companies to pay back customers who lose money during power outages that last more than 48 hours. If a customer incurs expenses such as spoiled food or medicines due to the outage, the utility must reimburse them, especially if the loss exceeds $200 and receipts are provided. Utilities are also required to keep records of major outages, including details like when and where they happen, how many people are affected, causes, and how the utility responded. These records will be made available to the public on utility websites, promoting transparency and accountability.
