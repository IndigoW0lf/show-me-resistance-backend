summary: |
  This bill, called the "Patients First Act," makes it illegal for health insurance plans in Missouri to discriminate against healthcare providers because of their professional licenses. It requires insurance companies to reimburse providers equally for the same services, as long as those services are within the providerâ€™s legal scope. The law aims to promote fair treatment and payment for healthcare providers, ensuring patients have access to a variety of qualified providers. The Missouri Department of Commerce and Insurance will oversee and enforce these rules to make sure health plans follow the law.
