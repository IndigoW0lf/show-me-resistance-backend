summary_short: "This bill requires government employees to get landowner permission or a search warrant before placing cameras on private property."

summary: |
  The bill changes the rules about placing surveillance or game cameras on private land. Now, government workers must first ask the landowner for permission or have a legal search warrant before installing a camera. This applies to cameras used for surveillance or hunting-related purposes. The goal is to protect private property rights and ensure privacy is respected unless there is proper legal authority to conduct surveillance.
