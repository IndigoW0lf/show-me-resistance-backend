summary: |
  The bill updates rules for filing to run for school board or other local offices in Missouri. It specifies that, in small districts with 2,000 or fewer residents, if no election is needed because the number of candidates matches the available seats, those candidates automatically assume office without an election. The bill also clarifies how candidates file their paperwork, including rules for determining the order of candidate names on ballots. Overall, it aims to simplify and clarify the process of running for local school board and district offices, affecting candidates, election officials, and local governments.
