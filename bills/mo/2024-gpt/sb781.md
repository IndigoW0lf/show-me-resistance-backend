summary_short: "This bill lets counties in Missouri choose to pass laws that prevent requiring workers to join or pay fees to labor unions, known as 'right-to-work' laws."

summary: |
  This bill allows individual counties in Missouri to decide whether to adopt laws that give workers the right not to join or pay fees to labor unions as a condition of employment. It defines rights for workers to choose whether they want to be part of a labor organization and prohibits employers from forcing employees to join or financially support such groups. The bill also establishes penalties for violations, allows injured workers to seek damages, and outlines enforcement responsibilities. However, this law would only apply in counties that choose to pass it through local government votes, meaning not all areas would be affected unless they opt in.
