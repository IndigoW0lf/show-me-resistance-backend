summary: |
  This bill establishes the "Forgivable Grant Program for Families of Adopted Children with Special Needs" within the division of senior and disability services. The program provides grants that can be forgiven over time to help families who have adopted children with special needs, specifically for home improvements or projects that support the children's needs. To qualify, families must have adopted at least three children with special needs, with at least two of those children living in the home for more than 18 years, and all children in the home must have lived there for a total of at least 50 years. The program includes conditions on how the grants are repaid and forgiven, and funds come from a dedicated state account. This aims to support families who have made long-term commitments to children with special needs by helping improve their living environments.
