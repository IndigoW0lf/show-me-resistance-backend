19 than the political subdivision, towards any new construction or improvements on such real
20 property completed after January 1, 2008, and which are included in the above-mentioned
21 possessory interest, regardless of the year in which such costs were incurred or whether such
22 costswereconsideredinanyprioryear. Theassessorshallannuallyassessallrealpropertyin
23 the following manner: new assessed values shall be determined as of January first of each
24 odd-numbered year and shall be entered in the assessor's books; those same assessed values
25 shall apply in the following even-numbered year, except for new construction and property
26 improvementswhich shall be valued as though they had been completed as of Januaryfirst of
27 the preceding odd-numbered year. The assessor may call at the office, place of doing
28 business, or residence of each person required by this chapter to list property, and require the
29 person to make a correct statement of all taxable tangible personal property owned by the
30 person or under his or her care, charge or management, taxable in the county. On or before
31 January first of each even-numbered year, the assessor shall prepare and submit a two-year
32 assessment maintenance plan to the county governing body and the state tax commission for
33 their respective approval or modification. The county governing body shall approve and
34 forward such plan or its alternative to the plan to the state tax commission by February first.
35 If the county governing body fails to forward the plan or its alternative to the plan to the state
36 tax commission by February first, the assessor's plan shall be considered approved by the
37 countygoverning body. If the state tax commission fails to approve a plan and if the state tax
38 commission and the assessor and the governing body of the county involved are unable to
39 resolve the differences, in order to receive state cost-share funds outlined in section 137.750,
40 the county or the assessor shall petition the administrative hearing commission, by May first,
41 to decide all matters in dispute regarding the assessment maintenance plan. Upon agreement
42 of the parties, the matter may be stayed while the parties proceed with mediation or
43 arbitration upon terms agreed to by the parties. The final decision of the administrative
44 hearing commission shall be subject to judicial review in the circuit court of the county
45 involved. In the event a valuation of subclass (1) real property within any county with a
46 charter form of government, or within a city not within a county, is made by a computer,
47 computer-assisted method or a computer program, the burden of proof, supported by clear,
48 convincing and cogent evidence to sustain such valuation, shall be on the assessor at any
49 hearing or appeal. In any such county, unless the assessor proves otherwise, there shall be a
50 presumption that the assessment was made by a computer, computer-assisted method or a
51 computer program. Such evidence shall include, but shall not be limited to, the following:
52 (1) The findings of the assessor based on an appraisal of the property by generally
53 accepted appraisal techniques; and
HB 2403 3
54 (2) The purchase prices from sales of at least three comparable properties and the
55 address or location thereof. As used in this subdivision, the word "comparable" means that:
56 (a) Such sale was closed at a date relevant to the property valuation; and
57 (b) Such properties are not more than one mile from the site of the disputed property,
58 except where no similar properties exist within one mile of the disputed property, the nearest
59 comparable property shall be used. Such property shall be within five hundred square feet in

61 rooms, and other relevant characteristics.
62 2. Assessors in each county of this state and the City of St. Louis may send personal
63 property assessment forms through the mail.
64 3. The following items of personal property shall each constitute separate subclasses
65 of tangible personal property and shall be assessed and valued for the purposes of taxation at
66 the following percentages of their true value in money, except as provided in subsection 9
67 of this section:
68 (1) Grain and other agricultural crops in an unmanufactured condition, one-half of
69 one percent;
70 (2) Livestock, twelve percent;

76 (5) Poultry, twelve percent; and
77 (6) Tools and equipment used for pollution control and tools and equipment used in

79 to existing products by any company which is located in a state enterprise zone and which is
80 identified by any standard industrial classification number cited in subdivision (7) of section
81 135.200, twenty-five percent.
82 4. The person listing the property shall enter a true and correct statement of the
83 property, in a printed blank prepared for that purpose. The statement, after being filled out,
84 shall be signed and either affirmed or sworn to as provided in section 137.155. The list shall
85 then be delivered to the assessor.
86 5. (1) All subclasses of real property, as such subclasses are established in Section 4
87 (b)ofArticleXoftheMissouriConstitutionanddefinedinsection137.016,shallbeassessed

HB 2403 4
91 (c) For real property in subclass (3), thirty-two percent.

93 thentheassessorofsuchcity,forthereclassificationofsuchtaxpayer'srealpropertyiftheuse
94 or purpose of such real property is changed after such property is assessed under the
95 provisions of this chapter. If the assessor determines that such property shall be reclassified,
96 he or she shall determine the assessment under this subsection based on the percentage of the
97 tax year that such property was classified in each subclassification.
98 6. Manufactured homes, as defined in section 700.010, which are actually used as
99 dwelling units shall be assessed at the same percentage of true value as residential real
100 property for the purpose of taxation. The percentage of assessment of true value for such
101 manufactured homes shall be the same as for residential real property. If the county collector
102 cannot identify or find the manufactured home when attempting to attach the manufactured
103 home for payment of taxes owed by the manufactured home owner, the county collector may
104 request the county commission to have the manufactured home removed from the tax books,
105 and such request shall be granted within thirty days after the request is made; however, the
106 removal from the tax books does not remove the tax lien on the manufactured home if it is
107 later identified or found. For purposes of this section, a manufactured home located in a
108 manufactured home rental park, rental community or on real estate not owned by the
109 manufactured home owner shall be considered personal property. For purposes of this
110 section, a manufactured home located on real estate owned by the manufactured home owner
111 may be considered real property.
112 7. Each manufactured home assessed shall be considered a parcel for the purpose of
113 reimbursement pursuant to section 137.750, unless the manufactured home is deemed to be
114 realestate asdefined in subsection7 of section442.015 and assessedas a realtyimprovement
115 to the existing real estate parcel.
116 8. Any amount of tax due and owing based on the assessment of a manufactured
117 home shall be included on the personal property tax statement of the manufactured home
118 owner unless the manufactured home is deemed to be real estate as defined in subsection 7 of
119 section 442.015, in which case the amount of tax due and owing on the assessment of the
120 manufactured home as a realty improvement to the existing real estate parcel shall be
121 included on the real property tax statement of the real estate owner.
122 9. To determine the true value in money for motor vehicles and farm machinery,
123 the assessor of each county and each city not within a county shall use the [trade-in value
124 publishedinthe October issueofthe National AutomobileDealers' AssociationOfficial Used
125 Car Guide, or its successor publication, as the recommended guide of information for

131 listing for a particular motor vehicle in such publication, the assessor shall use such
132 information or publications which in the assessor's judgment will fairly estimate the true

157 by the state tax commission from the general assembly. The state tax commission or the
158 state of Missouri shall be the registered user of the value guide with rights to allow all
159 assessors access to the guide and to an online site. Counties shall be responsible for

165 If a county creates its own software, it shall meet the same standards as the approved
166 vendors. The data shall be available to all vendors by August fifteenth annually. All
167 vendors shall have the data available for use in their client counties by October first
168 prior to the January first assessment date. When the manufacturer's suggested retail
169 price data is not available from the approved source or the assessor deems it not
170 appropriate for the vehicle value he or she is valuing, the assessor may obtain a
171 manufacturer's suggested retail price from a source he or she deems reliable and apply
172 the depreciation schedule set out above.
173 10. Before the assessor may increase the assessed valuation of any parcel of subclass
174 (1) real property by more than fifteen percent since the last assessment, excluding increases
175 due to new construction or improvements, the assessor shall conduct a physical inspection of
176 such property.
177 11. If a physical inspection is required, pursuant to subsection 10 of this section, the
178 assessor shall notify the property owner of that fact in writing and shall provide the owner
179 clear written notice of the owner's rights relating to the physical inspection. If a physical
180 inspection is required, the property owner may request that an interior inspection be
181 performed during the physical inspection. The owner shall have no less than thirty days to
182 notify the assessor of a request for an interior physical inspection.
183 12. A physical inspection, as required by subsection 10 of this section, shall include,
