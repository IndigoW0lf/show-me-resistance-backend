65 operating permit requirements.
66 [7.] 8. Before issuing any permit required by this section, the director shall issue such

86 from the source, establish and maintain records and make reports regarding such
87 determination.
88 [9.] 10. The director shall promptly notify the applicant in writing of his or her action

103 hearing commission, or modifies or vacates the decision recommended by the administrative
104 hearing commission, it shall issue its own decision, which shall include findings of fact and

137 permittee to notify the clean water commission of any substantial change in volume or
138 character of water contaminants or pollutants being introduced into its treatment works or
139 facility by a source which was introducing water contaminants or pollutants into its works at
140 the time of issuance of the permit. Notice must describe the quality and quantity of effluent
141 being introduced or to be introduced into such works or facility by a source which was
142 introducing water contaminants or pollutants into its works at the time of issuance of the
143 permit. Notice must describe the quality and quantity of effluent being introduced or to be
144 introduced into such works or facility and the anticipated impact of such introduction on the
145 quality or quantity of effluent to be released from such works or facility into waters of the
146 state.
147 [15.] 16. The director or the commission may require the filing or posting of a bond
148 as a condition for the issuance of permits for construction of temporary or future water

151 provisionsofsections644.006to644.141,andanyrulesorregulationsofthecommissionand
152 any condition as to such construction in the permit. For the purposes of this section,
153 "innovative technology for wastewater treatment" shall mean a completely new and generally
154 unproven technology in the type or method of its application that bench testing or theory
155 suggest has environmental, efficiency, and cost benefits beyond the standard technologies.
156 No bond shall be required for designs approved by any federal agency or environmental
