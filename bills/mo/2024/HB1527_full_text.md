2 thereof, to be known as section 137.115, to read as follows:
137.115. 1. All other laws to the contrary notwithstanding, the assessor or the
2 assessor's deputies in all counties of this state including the City of St. Louis shall annually
3 make a list of all real and tangible personal property taxable in the assessor's city, county,
4 town or district. Except as otherwise provided in subsection 3 of this section and section
5 137.078, the assessor shall annually assess all personal property at thirty-three and one-third
6 percentofits truevalueinmoneyasofJanuaryfirst ofeachcalendaryear. Theassessorshall
7 annually assess all real property, including any new construction and improvements to real
8 property, and possessory interests in real property at the percent of its true value in money set

10 property in subclass (3), where such real property is on or lies within the ultimate airport
11 boundary as shown by a federal airport layout plan, as defined by 14 CFR 151.5, of a
12 commercial airport having a FAR Part 139 certification and owned by a political subdivision,
13 shall be the otherwise applicable true value in money of any such possessory interest in real
14 property, less the total dollar amount of costs paid by a party, other than the political
15 subdivision, towards any new construction or improvements on such real property completed

HB 1527 2
18 considered in any prior year. The assessor shall annually assess all real property in the
19 following manner: new assessed values shall be determined as of January first of each odd-
20 numbered year and shall be entered in the assessor's books; those same assessed values shall
21 apply in the following even-numbered year, except for new construction and property
22 improvementswhich shall be valued as though they had been completed as of Januaryfirst of
23 the preceding odd-numbered year. The assessor may call at the office, place of doing
24 business, or residence of each person required by this chapter to list property, and require the
25 person to make a correct statement of all taxable tangible personal property owned by the
26 person or under his or her care, charge or management, taxable in the county. On or before
27 January first of each even-numbered year, the assessor shall prepare and submit a two-year
28 assessment maintenance plan to the county governing body and the state tax commission for
29 their respective approval or modification. The county governing body shall approve and
30 forward such plan or its alternative to the plan to the state tax commission by February first.
31 If the county governing body fails to forward the plan or its alternative to the plan to the state
32 tax commission by February first, the assessor's plan shall be considered approved by the
33 countygoverning body. If the state tax commission fails to approve a plan and if the state tax
34 commission and the assessor and the governing body of the county involved are unable to
35 resolve the differences, in order to receive state cost-share funds outlined in section 137.750,
36 the county or the assessor shall petition the administrative hearing commission, by May first,
37 to decide all matters in dispute regarding the assessment maintenance plan. Upon agreement
38 of the parties, the matter may be stayed while the parties proceed with mediation or
39 arbitration upon terms agreed to by the parties. The final decision of the administrative
40 hearing commission shall be subject to judicial review in the circuit court of the county
41 involved. In the event a valuation of subclass (1) real property within any county with a
42 charter form of government, or within a city not within a county, is made by a computer,
43 computer-assisted method or a computer program, the burden of proof, supported by clear,
44 convincing and cogent evidence to sustain such valuation, shall be on the assessor at any
45 hearing or appeal. In any such county, unless the assessor proves otherwise, there shall be a
46 presumption that the assessment was made by a computer, computer-assisted method or a
47 computer program. Such evidence shall include, but shall not be limited to, the following:
48 (1) The findings of the assessor based on an appraisal of the property by generally
49 accepted appraisal techniques; and
50 (2) The purchase prices from sales of at least three comparable properties and the
51 address or location thereof. As used in this subdivision, the word "comparable" means that:
52 (a) Such sale was closed at a date relevant to the property valuation; and
53 (b) Such properties are not more than one mile from the site of the disputed property,
54 except where no similar properties exist within one mile of the disputed property, the nearest

58 2. Assessors in each county of this state and the City of St. Louis may send personal
59 property assessment forms through the mail.
60 3. The following items of personal property shall each constitute separate subclasses
61 of tangible personal property and shall be assessed and valued for the purposes of taxation at
62 the following percentages of their true value in money:
63 (1) Grain and other agricultural crops in an unmanufactured condition, one-half of
64 one percent;
65 (2) Livestock, twelve percent;
66 (3) Farm machinery, twelve percent;
67 (4) Motorvehicleswhichareatleastsevenyearsold,basedonthemodelyear,and

76 to existing products by any company which is located in a state enterprise zone and which is
77 identified by any standard industrial classification number cited in subdivision (7) of section
78 135.200, twenty-five percent.
79 4. The person listing the property shall enter a true and correct statement of the
80 property, in a printed blank prepared for that purpose. The statement, after being filled out,
81 shall be signed and either affirmed or sworn to as provided in section 137.155. The list shall
82 then be delivered to the assessor.
83 5. (1) All subclasses of real property, as such subclasses are established in Section 4
84 (b)ofArticleXoftheMissouriConstitutionanddefinedinsection137.016,shallbeassessed
85 at the following percentages of true value:
86 (a) For real property in subclass (1), nineteen percent;
87 (b) For real property in subclass (2), twelve percent; and

91 or purpose of such real property is changed after such property is assessed under the
HB 1527 4
92 provisions of this chapter. If the assessor determines that such property shall be reclassified,
93 he or she shall determine the assessment under this subsection based on the percentage of the
94 tax year that such property was classified in each subclassification.
95 6. Manufactured homes, as defined in section 700.010, which are actually used as
96 dwelling units shall be assessed at the same percentage of true value as residential real
97 property for the purpose of taxation. The percentage of assessment of true value for such
98 manufactured homes shall be the same as for residential real property. If the county collector
99 cannot identify or find the manufactured home when attempting to attach the manufactured
100 home for payment of taxes owed by the manufactured home owner, the county collector may
101 request the county commission to have the manufactured home removed from the tax books,
102 and such request shall be granted within thirty days after the request is made; however, the
103 removal from the tax books does not remove the tax lien on the manufactured home if it is
104 later identified or found. For purposes of this section, a manufactured home located in a
105 manufactured home rental park, rental community or on real estate not owned by the
106 manufactured home owner shall be considered personal property. For purposes of this
107 section, a manufactured home located on real estate owned by the manufactured home owner
108 may be considered real property.
109 7. Each manufactured home assessed shall be considered a parcel for the purpose of
110 reimbursement pursuant to section 137.750, unless the manufactured home is deemed to be
111 realestate asdefined in subsection7 of section442.015 and assessedas a realtyimprovement
112 to the existing real estate parcel.
113 8. Any amount of tax due and owing based on the assessment of a manufactured
114 home shall be included on the personal property tax statement of the manufactured home
115 owner unless the manufactured home is deemed to be real estate as defined in subsection 7 of
116 section 442.015, in which case the amount of tax due and owing on the assessment of the
117 manufactured home as a realty improvement to the existing real estate parcel shall be
118 included on the real property tax statement of the real estate owner.

121 Used Car Guide, or its successor publication, as the recommended guide of information for
122 determiningthetruevalueofmotorvehiclesdescribedinsuchpublication. Theassessorshall
123 not use a value that is greater than the average trade-in value in determining the true value of
124 themotorvehiclewithoutperformingaphysicalinspectionofthemotorvehicle. Forvehicles
125 two years old or newer from a vehicle's model year, the assessor may use a value other than
126 average without performing a physical inspection of the motor vehicle. In the absence of a
127 listing for a particular motor vehicle in such publication, the assessor shall use such
HB 1527 5
128 information or publications which in the assessor's judgment will fairly estimate the true
129 value in money of the motor vehicle.
130 10. Before the assessor may increase the assessed valuation of any parcel of subclass
131 (1) real property by more than fifteen percent since the last assessment, excluding increases
132 due to new construction or improvements, the assessor shall conduct a physical inspection of
133 such property.
134 11. If a physical inspection is required, pursuant to subsection 10 of this section, the
135 assessor shall notify the property owner of that fact in writing and shall provide the owner
136 clear written notice of the owner's rights relating to the physical inspection. If a physical
137 inspection is required, the property owner may request that an interior inspection be
138 performed during the physical inspection. The owner shall have no less than thirty days to
139 notify the assessor of a request for an interior physical inspection.
140 12. A physical inspection, as required by subsection 10 of this section, shall include,
141 butnotbelimited to,anon-sitepersonalobservationandreview ofallexteriorportionsofthe
142 land and any buildings and improvements to which the inspector has or may reasonably and

153 such payment a fee equal to the fee charged the county by the bank, processor, or issuer of
154 such electronic payment.

156 the governing body of such county, opt out of the provisions of this section and sections

182 section may levy separate and differing tax rates for real and personal property only if such
183 city bills and collects its own property taxes or satisfies the entire cost of the billing and
184 collection of such separate and differing tax rates. Such separate and differing rates shall not
185 exceed such city's tax rate ceiling.
186 16. Any portion of real property that is available as reserve for strip, surface, or coal
187 mining for minerals for purposes of excavation for future use or sale to others that has not
188 been bonded and permitted under chapter 444 shall be assessed based upon how the real
189 property is currently being used. Any information provided to a county assessor, state tax
190 commission, state agency, or political subdivision responsible for the administration of tax
191 policies shall, in the performance of its duties, make available all books, records, and
