23 investment decisions.
24 (2) For purposes of this subsection, the following
25 terms mean:
26 (a) "Nonfinancial objective", the material fact to

33 seeking to obtain an effect other than the maximization of
34 financial return to the client;

60 if applicable, by repurchase agreement in obligations

62 Missouri, as the treasurer in the exercise of the
63 treasurer's best judgment determines to be in the best
64 overall interest of the people of the state of Missouri,
65 giving due consideration to:
66 (1) The preservation of such state moneys;
67 (2) The benefits to the economy and welfare of the
68 people of Missouri when such state money is invested in
69 banking institutions in this state that, in turn, provide
70 additional loans and investments in the Missouri economy and
71 generate state taxes from such initial investments and the
72 loans and investments created by the banking institutions,
73 compared to the removal or withholding from banking
74 institutions in the state of all or some such state moneys
75 and investing same in obligations authorized in Section 15,
76 Article IV of the Missouri Constitution;
77 (3) The liquidity needs of the state;
78 (4) The aggregate return in earnings and taxes on the

80 (5) All other factors which to the treasurer as a
81 prudent state treasurer seem to be relevant to the general
SB 827 4
82 public welfare in the light of the circumstances at the time
83 prevailing. The state treasurer may also place state moneys
84 which are determined not needed for current operations of

174 the Missouri Constitution, or any other calculation
175 determined by the state treasurer based on current market

189 investment of state moneys at the time and in payment
190 therefor may withdraw moneys from any bank account, demand
191 or time, maintained by the treasurer without having any
192 supporting warrant of the commissioner of administration.

197 manner that securities pledged to secure the repayment of
198 state moneys deposited in banking institutions are kept by
199 the treasurer pursuant to law. The state treasurer may hold
200 any such obligation so acquired by the treasurer until its
201 maturity or prior thereto may sell the same outright or by
