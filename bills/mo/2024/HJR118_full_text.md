10 profit and used exclusively for religious worship, for schools and colleges, for purposes
11 purely charitable, for agricultural and horticultural societies, or for veterans' organizations
12 may be exempted from taxation by general law. In addition to the above, household goods,
13 furniture, wearing apparel and articles of personal use and adornment owned and used by a
14 person in his home or dwelling place may be exempt from taxation by general law but any
15 such law may provide for approximate restitution to the respective political subdivisions of
16 revenues lost by reason of the exemption. All laws exempting from taxation property other
17 than the property enumerated in this article, shall be void. The provisions of this section
18 exempting certain personal property of manufacturers, refiners, distributors, wholesalers, and
19 retail merchants and establishments from taxation shall become effective, unless otherwise
20 provided by law, in each county on January 1 of the year in which that county completes its
21 first general reassessment as defined by law.
22 2. All revenues lost because of the exemption of certain personal property of
23 manufacturers, refiners, distributors, wholesalers, and retail merchants and establishments
24 shall be replaced to each taxing authority within a county from a countywide tax hereby
25 imposed on all property in subclass 3 of class 1 in each county. For the year in which the
26 exemption becomes effective, the county clerk shall calculate the total revenue lost by all
27 taxing authorities in the county and extend upon all property in subclass 3 of class 1 within
28 the county, a tax at the rate necessary to produce that amount. The rate of tax levied in each
29 county according to this subsection shall not be increased above the rate first imposed and
30 will stand levied at that rate unless later reduced according to the provisions of subsection 3.
31 The county collector shall disburse the proceeds according to the revenue lost by each taxing
32 authority because of the exemption of such property in that county. Restitution of the
33 revenues lost by any taxing district contained in more than one county shall be from the
34 several counties according to the revenue lost because of the exemption of property in each
35 county. Each year after the first year the replacement tax is imposed, the amount distributed
36 to each taxing authority in a county shall be increased or decreased by an amount equal to the
37 amount resulting from the change in that district's total assessed value of property in subclass
38 3 of class 1 at the countywide replacement tax rate. In order to implement the provisions of
39 this subsection, the limits set in section 11(b) of this article may be exceeded, without voter
40 approval, if necessary to allow each county listed in section 11(b) to comply with this
41 subsection.
42 3. Any increase in the tax rate imposed pursuant to subsection 2 of this section shall
43 be decreased if such decrease is approved by a majority of the voters of the county voting on
44 suchdecrease. Adecreaseintheincreasedtaxrateimposedundersubsection2ofthissection

50 property tax on all personal property held as industrial inventories, including raw materials,
51 work in progress and finished work on hand, by manufacturers and refiners, and all personal
52 property held as goods, wares, merchandise, stock in trade or inventory for resale by
53 distributors, wholesalers, or retail merchants or establishments in the last full tax year
54 immediately preceding the effective date of the exemption from taxation granted for such
55 property under subsection 1 of this section, and which was no longer received after such
