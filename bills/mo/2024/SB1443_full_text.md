126 nursing facility. Personal care services shall be rendered
127 by an individual not a member of the participant's family
128 who is qualified to provide such services where the services
129 are prescribed by a physician in accordance with a plan of
130 treatment and are supervised by a licensed nurse. Persons
131 eligible to receive personal care services shall be those
132 persons who would otherwise require placement in a hospital,
133 intermediate care facility, or skilled nursing facility.
134 Benefits payable for personal care services shall not exceed
135 for any one participant one hundred percent of the average
136 statewide charge for care and treatment in an intermediate
137 care facility for a comparable period of time. Such
138 services, when delivered in a residential care facility or
139 assisted living facility licensed under chapter 198 shall be
140 authorized on a tier level based on the services the
141 resident requires and the frequency of the services. A
142 resident of such facility who qualifies for assistance under
143 section 208.030 shall, at a minimum, if prescribed by a
144 physician, qualify for the tier level with the fewest
145 services. The rate paid to providers for each tier of
146 service shall be set subject to appropriations. Subject to
SB 1443 6
147 appropriations, each resident of such facility who qualifies
148 for assistance under section 208.030 and meets the level of
149 care required in this section shall, at a minimum, if
150 prescribed by a physician, be authorized up to one hour of
151 personal care services per day. Authorized units of
152 personal care services shall not be reduced or tier level
153 lowered unless an order approving such reduction or lowering
154 is obtained from the resident's personal physician. Such
155 authorized units of personal care services or tier level
156 shall be transferred with such resident if he or she
157 transfers to another such facility. Such provision shall
158 terminate upon receipt of relevant waivers from the federal
159 Department of Health and Human Services. If the Centers for
160 Medicare and Medicaid Services determines that such
161 provision does not comply with the state plan, this
162 provision shall be null and void. The MO HealthNet division
163 shall notify the revisor of statutes as to whether the
164 relevant waivers are approved or a determination of
165 noncompliance is made;
166 (16) Mental health services. The state plan for
167 providing medical assistance under Title XIX of the Social
168 Security Act, 42 U.S.C. Section [301] 1396 et seq., as

177 health shall establish by administrative rule the definition

373 interdisciplinary assessment designed to restore an
374 individual to optimal level of physical, cognitive, and
375 behavioral function. The MO HealthNet division shall
376 establish by administrative rule the definition and criteria
377 for designation of a comprehensive day rehabilitation
378 service facility, benefit limitations and payment
379 mechanism. Any rule or portion of a rule, as that term is

382 effective only if it complies with and is subject to all of
383 the provisions of chapter 536 and, if applicable, section
384 536.028. This section and chapter 536 are nonseverable and
385 if any of the powers vested with the general assembly
386 pursuant to chapter 536 to review, to delay the effective
387 date, or to disapprove and annul a rule are subsequently
388 held unconstitutional, then the grant of rulemaking
389 authority and any rule proposed or adopted after August 28,
390 2005, shall be invalid and void.
391 3. The MO HealthNet division may require any
392 participant receiving MO HealthNet benefits to pay part of
393 the charge or cost until July 1, 2008, and an additional
394 payment after July 1, 2008, as defined by rule duly
395 promulgated by the MO HealthNet division, for all covered
396 services except for those services covered under
397 subdivisions (15) and (16) of subsection 1 of this section
398 and sections 208.631 to 208.657 to the extent and in the
399 manner authorized by Title XIX of the federal Social
400 Security Act (42 U.S.C. Section 1396, et seq.) and
401 regulations thereunder. When substitution of a generic drug
SB 1443 14
402 is permitted by the prescriber according to section 338.056,
403 and a generic drug is substituted for a name-brand drug, the
404 MO HealthNet division may not lower or delete the
405 requirement to make a co-payment pursuant to regulations of
406 Title XIX of the federal Social Security Act. A provider of
407 goods or services described under this section must collect
408 from all participants the additional payment that may be
409 required by the MO HealthNet division under authority
410 granted herein, if the division exercises that authority, to
411 remain eligible as a provider. Any payments made by
412 participants under this section shall be in addition to and
413 not in lieu of payments made by the state for goods or
414 services described herein except the participant portion of
415 the pharmacy professional dispensing fee shall be in
416 addition to and not in lieu of payments to pharmacists. A
417 provider may collect the co-payment at the time a service is
418 provided or at a later date. A provider shall not refuse to
419 provide a service if a participant is unable to pay a
420 required payment. If it is the routine business practice of
421 a provider to terminate future services to an individual
422 with an unclaimed debt, the provider may include uncollected
423 co-payments under this practice. Providers who elect not to
424 undertake the provision of services based on a history of
425 bad debt shall give participants advance notice and a
426 reasonable opportunity for payment. A provider,
427 representative, employee, independent contractor, or agent
428 of a pharmaceutical manufacturer shall not make co-payment
429 for a participant. This subsection shall not apply to other
430 qualified children, pregnant women, or blind persons. If
431 the Centers for Medicare and Medicaid Services does not
432 approve the MO HealthNet state plan amendment submitted by
433 the department of social services that would allow a
SB 1443 15
434 provider to deny future services to an individual with
435 uncollected co-payments, the denial of services shall not be
436 allowed. The department of social services shall inform
437 providers regarding the acceptability of denying services as
438 the result of unpaid co-payments.
439 4. The MO HealthNet division shall have the right to
440 collect medication samples from participants in order to
441 maintain program integrity.
442 5. Reimbursement for obstetrical and pediatric
443 services under subdivision (6) of subsection 1 of this
444 section shall be timely and sufficient to enlist enough
445 health care providers so that care and services are
446 available under the state plan for MO HealthNet benefits at
447 least to the extent that such care and services are
448 available to the general population in the geographic area,
449 as required under subparagraph (a)(30)(A) of 42 U.S.C.
450 Section 1396a and federal regulations promulgated thereunder.
451 6. Beginning July 1, 1990, reimbursement for services
452 rendered in federally funded health centers shall be in
453 accordance with the provisions of subsection 6402(c) and
454 Section 6404 of P.L. 101-239 (Omnibus Budget Reconciliation
455 Act of 1989) and federal regulations promulgated thereunder.
456 7. Beginning July 1, 1990, the department of social
457 services shall provide notification and referral of children
458 below age five, and pregnant, breast-feeding, or postpartum
459 women who are determined to be eligible for MO HealthNet
460 benefits under section 208.151 to the special supplemental
461 food programs for women, infants and children administered
462 by the department of health and senior services. Such
463 notification and referral shall conform to the requirements
464 of Section 6406 of P.L. 101-239 and regulations promulgated
465 thereunder.
SB 1443 16
466 8. Providers of long-term care services shall be
467 reimbursed for their costs in accordance with the provisions
468 of Section 1902 (a)(13)(A) of the Social Security Act, 42
469 U.S.C. Section 1396a, as amended, and regulations
470 promulgated thereunder.
471 9. Reimbursement rates to long-term care providers
472 with respect to a total change in ownership, at arm's
473 length, for any facility previously licensed and certified
474 for participation in the MO HealthNet program shall not
475 increase payments in excess of the increase that would
476 result from the application of Section 1902 (a)(13)(C) of
477 the Social Security Act, 42 U.S.C. Section 1396a (a)(13)(C).
