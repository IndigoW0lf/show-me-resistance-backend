SB 1413 2
14 county, or the county executive thereof, in any manner
15 impede, obstruct, hinder, or interfere with the boards of
16 police, any officer, agent, or servant thereof or thereunder.
1 84.020. In [all cities of this state that now have, or
2 may hereafter attain, a population of five hundred thousand
3 inhabitants or over] any charter county with more than four
4 hundred thousand but less than five hundred thousand
5 inhabitants, there shall be, and is hereby established,
6 within and for said [cities] county, a board of police, to
7 consist of four commissioners, as provided in sections
8 84.040 to 84.080, together with the [mayor of said cities]
9 county executive of the county for the time being, or
10 whosoever may be officially acting in that capacity, and
11 said board shall appoint one of its members as president,
12 and one member who shall act as vice president during the
13 absence of the president; and such president or vice
14 president shall be the executive officer of the board and
15 shall act for it when the board is not in session.
1 84.030. Beginning on [January 9, 1989] August 28,
2 2024, and no later than September 28, 2024, the governor of
3 the state of Missouri, by and with the advice and consent of

6 appointed for a term of one year; one commissioner shall be
7 appointed for a term of two years; one commissioner shall be
8 appointed for a term of three years; one commissioner shall
9 be appointed for a term of four years. Their successors
10 shall each be appointed for a term of four years, and said
11 commissioners shall hold office for their term of
12 appointment and until their successors shall have been
13 appointed and qualified. In case of a vacancy in said board
14 for any cause whatsoever, it shall be filled by appointment
SB 1413 3
15 for the unexpired term, in the same manner as in the case of
16 original appointments. The governor shall issue commissions
17 to the persons so appointed, designating the time for which
18 they are appointed in case the appointment is to fill an
19 unexpired term occasioned by death, resignation or any other
20 cause, and whenever the term of office of any commissioner
21 expires, the appointment of his successor shall be for four
22 years. [The commissioners now holding offices under
23 existing laws in any city of this state to which sections
24 84.010 to 84.340 apply are to hold their offices until the
25 expiration of their terms, and their successors are duly
26 appointed and qualified.]
1 84.100. To enable the boards to perform the duties
2 imposed upon them, they are hereby authorized and required
3 to appoint, enroll and employ [a] only one permanent police
4 force for the [cities] county which they shall equip and arm
5 as they may judge necessary. Except as provided below, the
6 number of patrolmen to be appointed shall not be [more] less
7 than one thousand [six] three hundred [eighty-three]
8 thirteen, of which number not more than two hundred fifty
9 are to be probationary patrolmen. Any increase in the
10 number of patrolmen authorized, in addition to that provided
11 for above, shall be permitted upon recommendation by the
12 board of police commissioners, with the approval of the
13 [municipal board] governing body of the county of estimate
14 and apportionment. [The number of turnkeys to be appointed
15 shall be sixty-five, except that for each patrolman
16 hereafter promoted, demoted, removed, resigned or otherwise
17 separated from the force, an additional turnkey may be
18 appointed, but under no circumstances shall more than one
19 hundred fifty turnkeys be appointed. As each additional
20 turnkey is appointed, the maximum number of patrolmen to be
SB 1413 4
21 appointed shall be reduced accordingly so that when one
22 hundred fifty turnkeys have been appointed, the number of
23 patrolmen to be appointed shall not be more than one
24 thousand five hundred ninety-eight.] The board may continue
25 to employ as many noncommissioned police civilians, which
26 shall include park rangers, as it deems necessary in order
27 to perform the duties imposed upon it.
1 84.150. The maximum number of officers of the police
2 force in each such [city] county shall be as follows: [one
3 chief of police with the rank of colonel; lieutenant
4 colonels, not to exceed five in number and other such ranks
5 and number of members within such ranks as the board from
6 time to time deems necessary] seventy-six commissioned
7 officers at the rank of lieutenant and above; two hundred
8 commissioned officers at the rank of sergeant; and one
9 thousand thirty-seven commissioned officers at the rank of
10 patrolman. The officers of the police force shall have
11 commissions issued to them by the boards of police
12 commissioners, and those heretofore and those hereafter
13 commissioned shall serve so long as they shall faithfully
14 perform their duties and possess the necessary mental and
15 physical ability, and be subject to removal only for cause
16 after a hearing by the board, who are hereby invested with
17 exclusive jurisdiction in the premises.
1 84.160. 1. As of August 28, [2006] 2024, the board of
2 police commissioners shall have the authority to compute and
3 establish the annual salary of each member of the police

5 assembly, which shall not be less than the annual salary
6 paid to any member at the time of the enactment of this act.
7 2. Each officer of police and patrolman whose regular
8 assignment requires nonuniformed attire may receive, in
SB 1413 5
9 addition to his or her salary, an allowance not to exceed
10 three hundred sixty dollars per annum payable biweekly.
11 Notwithstanding the provisions of subsection 1 of this
12 section to the contrary, no additional compensation or
13 compensatory time off for overtime, court time, or standby
14 court time shall be paid or allowed to any officer of the
15 rank of [sergeant] lieutenant or above. Notwithstanding any
16 other provision of law to the contrary, nothing in this
17 section shall prohibit the payment of additional
18 compensation pursuant to this subsection to officers of the
19 ranks of sergeants and above, provided that funding for such
20 compensation shall not:
21 (1) Be paid from the general funds of either the
22 [city] county or the board of police commissioners of the
23 city; or
24 (2) Be violative of any federal law or other state law.
25 3. It is the duty of the [municipal assembly or common
26 council of the cities] governing body of the county to make

29 hereafter provided; provided, that in no event shall [such
30 municipal assembly or common council] the governing body of
31 the county be required to appropriate for such purposes
32 (including, but not limited to, costs of funding pensions or
33 retirement plans) for any fiscal year a sum in excess of any
34 limitation imposed by article X, section 21, Missouri
35 Constitution; and provided further, that such [municipal
36 assembly or common council] governing body may appropriate a
37 sum in excess of such limitation for any fiscal year by an
38 appropriations ordinance enacted in conformity with the
39 provisions of the charter of such [cities] county.

14 penalty of one thousand dollars for each offense,
15 recoverable by the boards by action at law in the name of
16 the state, and shall forever thereafter be disqualified from
17 holding or exercising any office or employment whatsoever
18 under the county executive or governing body of the county,
19 or under sections 84.012 to 84.340; provided that, nothing
20 in this section shall be construed to interfere with the
SB 1413 9
21 punishment, under any existing or any future laws of this
22 state, of any criminal offense that is committed by the
23 parties in or about the resistance, obstruction, hindrance,
24 conspiracy, combination, or disbursement aforesaid.
1 84.325. 1. On August 28, 2024, the board of police
2 commissioners shall assume control of any police force of
3 any charter county with more than four hundred thousand but
4 fewer than five hundred thousand inhabitants, according to
5 the procedures and requirements of this section and any
6 rules promulgated under subsection 6 of this section. The
7 purpose of these procedures and requirements is to provide
8 for an orderly and appropriate transition in the governance
9 of the police force and provide for an equitable employment
10 transition for commissioned and civilian personnel.
11 2. Upon the assumption of control by the board of
12 police commissioners under subsection 1 of this section, any
13 police department shall convey, assign, and otherwise
14 transfer to the board title and ownership of all
15 indebtedness and assets, including, but not limited to, all
16 funds and real and personal property held in the name of or
17 controlled by the municipal police department. Such county
18 shall thereafter cease the operation of any police
19 department or police force.
20 3. Upon the assumption of control by the board of
21 police commissioners under subsection 1 of this section, the
22 state shall accept responsibility, ownership, and liability
23 as successor-in-interest for contractual obligations and
24 other lawful obligations of the county police department.
25 4. The board of police commissioners shall initially
26 employ, without a reduction in rank, salary, or benefits,
27 all commissioned and civilian personnel of the police
28 department who were employed by the police department
SB 1413 10
29 immediately prior to the date the board assumed control.
30 The board shall recognize all accrued years of service that
31 such commissioned and civilian personnel had with the police
32 department, as well as all accrued years of service that
33 such commissioned and civilian personnel had previously with
34 the board of police commissioners. Such personnel shall be
35 entitled to the same holidays, vacation, sick leave, sick
36 bonus time, and annual step-increases they were entitled to
37 as employees of the police department.
38 5. The commissioned and civilian personnel who retire
39 from service with the police department before the board of
40 police commissioners assumes control of the department under
41 subsection 1 of this section shall continue to be entitled
42 to the same pension benefits provided as employees of the
43 police department and the same benefits set forth in
44 subsection 5 of this section. Any police pension system
45 created under chapter 86 for the benefit of a police force
46 established under sections 84.012 to 84.340 shall continue
47 to be governed by chapter 86 and shall apply to any
48 comprehensive policing plan and any police force established
49 under sections 84.012 to 84.340. Other than any provision
50 that makes chapter 86 applicable to a police force
51 established under sections 84.343 to 84.346, nothing in
52 sections 84.012 to 84.340 shall be construed as limiting or
53 changing the rights or benefits provided under chapter 86.
54 6. The board of police commissioners may promulgate
55 all necessary rules and regulations for the implementation
56 and administration of this section. Any rule or portion of
57 a rule, as that term is defined in section 536.010, that is
58 created under the authority delegated in this section shall
59 become effective only if it complies with and is subject to
60 all of the provisions of chapter 536 and, if applicable,
SB 1413 11
61 section 536.028. This section and chapter 536 are
62 nonseverable and if any of the powers vested with the
63 general assembly pursuant to chapter 536 to review, to delay
64 the effective date, or to disapprove and annul a rule are
65 subsequently held unconstitutional, then the grant of
66 rulemaking authority and any rule proposed or adopted after
67 August 28, 2024, shall be invalid and void.
1 105.726. 1. Nothing in sections 105.711 to 105.726
2 shall be construed to broaden the liability of the state of
3 Missouri beyond the provisions of sections 537.600 to
4 537.610, nor to abolish or waive any defense at law which
5 might otherwise be available to any agency, officer, or
6 employee of the state of Missouri. Sections 105.711 to
7 105.726 do not waive the sovereign immunity of the state of
8 Missouri.
9 2. The creation of the state legal expense fund and
10 the payment therefrom of such amounts as may be necessary
11 for the benefit of any person covered thereby are deemed
12 necessary and proper public purposes for which funds of this
13 state may be expended.
14 3. Moneys in the state legal expense fund shall not be
15 available for the payment of any claim or any amount
16 required by any final judgment rendered by a court of
17 competent jurisdiction against a board of police
18 commissioners established under chapter 84, including the
19 commissioners, any police officer, notwithstanding sections
20 84.330 and 84.710, or other provisions of law, other
21 employees, agents, representative, or any other individual
22 or entity acting or purporting to act on its or their
23 behalf. Such was the intent of the general assembly in the
24 original enactment of sections 105.711 to 105.726, and it is
25 made express by this section in light of the decision in
SB 1413 12
26 Wayman Smith, III, et al. v. State of Missouri, 152 S.W.3d
27 275. Except that the commissioner of administration shall
28 reimburse from the legal expense fund the board of police
29 commissioners established under [section 84.350, and any
30 successor-in-interest established pursuant to section
31 84.344,] chapter 84 for liability claims otherwise eligible
32 for payment under section 105.711 paid by such [board]
33 boards on an equal share basis per claim up to a maximum of
34 one million dollars per fiscal year.
35 4. [Subject to the provisions of subsection 2 of
36 section 84.345,] If the representation of the attorney
37 general is requested by a board of police commissioners [or
38 its successor-in-interest established pursuant to section
39 84.344], the attorney general shall represent, investigate,
40 defend, negotiate, or compromise all claims under sections
41 105.711 to 105.726 for the board of police commissioners,
42 its successor-in-interest pursuant to section 84.344, any
43 police officer, other employees, agents, representatives, or
44 any other individual or entity acting or purporting to act
45 on their behalf. The attorney general may establish
46 procedures by rules promulgated under chapter 536 under
47 which claims must be referred for the attorney general's
48 representation. The attorney general and the officials of
49 the [city] county which the police board represents [or
50 represented] shall meet and negotiate reasonable expenses or
51 charges that will fairly compensate the attorney general and
52 the office of administration for the cost of the
53 representation of the claims under this section.
54 5. Claims tendered to the attorney general promptly
55 after the claim was asserted as required by section 105.716
56 and prior to August 28, 2005, may be investigated, defended,
57 negotiated, or compromised by the attorney general and full
SB 1413 13
58 payments may be made from the state legal expense fund on
59 behalf of the entities and individuals described in this
60 section as a result of the holding in Wayman Smith, III, et
61 al. v. State of Missouri, 152 S.W.3d 275.
1 [84.175. 1. Upon recommendation of the
2 chief of police, the board may authorize and
3 provide for the organization of a police reserve
4 force composed of members who receive a service
5 retirement under the provisions of sections
6 86.200 to 86.366 and who qualify under the
7 provisions of section 84.120. Such reserve
8 force shall be under the command of the chief of
9 police and shall be provided training,
10 equipment, uniforms, and arms as the chief shall
11 direct with the approval of the board. Members
12 of the reserve force shall possess all of the
13 powers of regular police officers and shall be
14 subject to all laws and regulations applicable
15 to police officers; provided, however, that the
16 city council or other governing body of any such
17 city may in its discretion fix a total in number
18 which the reserve force may not exceed.
19 2. In event of riot or other emergencies
20 as declared and defined by the mayor, in
21 concurrence with the board, the board, upon
22 recommendation of the chief, may appoint special
23 officers or patrolmen for temporary service in
24 addition to the police reserve force herein
25 provided for, but the length of time for which
26 such officers or patrolmen shall be employed
27 shall be limited to the time during which such
28 emergency shall exist.]
1 [84.240. The board of police commissioners
2 shall establish the Bertillon system of
3 identification of criminals and others by means
4 of anthropometric indications, and they are
5 further required to employ such additional
6 assistance as may be necessary to properly
7 conduct and manage this department.]
1 [84.341. No elected or appointed official
2 of the state or any political subdivision
SB 1413 14
3 thereof shall act or refrain from acting in any
4 manner to impede, obstruct, hinder, or otherwise
5 interfere with any member of a municipal police
6 force established under sections 84.343 to
7 84.346 in the performance of his or her job
8 duties, or with any aspect of any investigation
9 arising from the performance of such job
10 duties. This section shall not be construed to
11 prevent such officials from acting within the
12 normal course and scope of their employment or
13 from acting to implement sections 84.343 to
14 84.346. Any person who violates this section
15 shall be liable for a penalty of two thousand
16 five hundred dollars for each offense and shall
17 forever be disqualified from holding any office
18 or employment whatsoever with the governmental
19 entity the person served at the time of the
20 violation. The penalty shall not be paid by the
21 funds of any committee as the term committee is
22 defined in section 130.011. This section shall
23 not be construed to interfere with the
24 punishment, under any laws of this state, of a
25 criminal offense committed by such officials,
26 nor shall this section apply to duly appointed
27 members of the municipal police force, or their
28 appointing authorities, whose conduct is
29 otherwise provided for by law.]
1 [84.342. 1. It shall be an unlawful
2 employment practice for an official, employee,
3 or agent of a municipal police force established
4 under sections 84.343 to 84.346 to discharge,
5 demote, reduce the pay of, or otherwise
6 retaliate against an employee of the municipal

17 2. Any person who acts as a private
18 watchman, private detective, or private

20 a written license from said cities is guilty of
21 a class A misdemeanor.]
1 [84.344. 1. Notwithstanding any
2 provisions of this chapter to the contrary, any
3 city not within a county may establish a
4 municipal police force on or after July 1, 2013,
5 according to the procedures and requirements of

12 2. Upon the establishment of a municipal
13 police force by a city under sections 84.343 to

17 assets, including, but not limited to, all funds
18 and real and personal property held in the name
19 of or controlled by the board of police
20 commissioners created under sections 84.010 to
21 84.340. The board of police commissioners shall
22 execute all documents reasonably required to
23 accomplish such transfer of ownership and
24 obligations.
SB 1413 16
25 3. If the city establishes a municipal
26 police force and completes the transfer
27 described in subsection 2 of this section, the
28 city shall provide the necessary funds for the
29 maintenance of the municipal police force.
30 4. Before a city not within a county may
31 establish a municipal police force under this
32 section, the city shall adopt an ordinance
33 accepting responsibility, ownership, and
34 liability as successor-in-interest for
35 contractual obligations, indebtedness, and other
36 lawful obligations of the board of police
37 commissioners subject to the provisions of
38 subsection 2 of section 84.345.
39 5. A city not within a county that
40 establishes a municipal police force shall
41 initially employ, without a reduction in rank,
42 salary, or benefits, all commissioned and
43 civilian personnel of the board of police
44 commissioners created under sections 84.010 to
45 84.340 that were employed by the board
46 immediately prior to the date the municipal
47 police force was established. Such commissioned
48 personnel who previously were employed by the
49 board may only be involuntarily terminated by
50 the city not within a county for cause. The
51 city shall also recognize all accrued years of
52 service that such commissioned and civilian
53 personnel had with the board of police
54 commissioners. Such personnel shall be entitled
55 to the same holidays, vacation, and sick leave
56 they were entitled to as employees of the board
57 of police commissioners.
58 6. Commissioned and civilian personnel of
59 a municipal police force established under this

64 one-hour response time.
65 7. The commissioned and civilian personnel
66 who retire from service with the board of police
67 commissioners before the establishment of a

SB 1413 17
69 this section shall continue to be entitled to
70 the same pension benefits provided under chapter
71 86 and the same benefits set forth in subsection
72 5 of this section.
73 8. If the city not within a county elects
74 to establish a municipal police force under this
75 section, the city shall establish a separate
76 division for the operation of its municipal
77 police force. The civil service commission of
78 the city may adopt rules and regulations
79 appropriate for the unique operation of a police
80 department. Such rules and regulations shall
81 reserve exclusive authority over the
82 disciplinary process and procedures affecting
83 commissioned officers to the civil service
84 commission; however, until such time as the city
85 adopts such rules and regulations, the
86 commissioned personnel shall continue to be
87 governed by the board of police commissioner's
88 rules and regulations in effect immediately
89 prior to the establishment of the municipal
90 police force, with the police chief acting in
91 place of the board of police commissioners for
92 purposes of applying the rules and regulations.
93 Unless otherwise provided for, existing civil
94 service commission rules and regulations
95 governing the appeal of disciplinary decisions
96 to the civil service commission shall apply to
97 all commissioned and civilian personnel. The
98 civil service commission's rules and regulations
99 shall provide that records prepared for
100 disciplinary purposes shall be confidential,
101 closed records available solely to the civil
102 service commission and those who possess
103 authority to conduct investigations regarding
104 disciplinary matters pursuant to the civil
105 service commission's rules and regulations. A
106 hearing officer shall be appointed by the civil
107 service commission to hear any such appeals that
108 involve discipline resulting in a suspension of
109 greater than fifteen days, demotion, or
110 termination, but the civil service commission
111 shall make the final findings of fact,
SB 1413 18
112 conclusions of law, and decision which shall be
113 subject to any right of appeal under chapter 536.
114 9. A city not within a county that
115 establishes and maintains a municipal police
116 force under this section:
117 (1) Shall provide or contract for life
118 insurance coverage and for insurance benefits
119 providing health, medical, and disability
120 coverage for commissioned and civilian personnel
121 of the municipal police force to the same extent
122 as was provided by the board of police
123 commissioners under section 84.160;
124 (2) Shall provide or contract for medical
125 and life insurance coverage for any commissioned
126 or civilian personnel who retired from service
127 with the board of police commissioners or who
128 were employed by the board of police
129 commissioners and retire from the municipal
130 police force of a city not within a county to
131 the same extent such medical and life insurance
132 coverage was provided by the board of police
133 commissioners under section 84.160;
134 (3) Shall make available medical and life
135 insurance coverage for purchase to the spouses
136 or dependents of commissioned and civilian
137 personnel who retire from service with the board
138 of police commissioners or the municipal police
139 force and deceased commissioned and civilian
140 personnel who receive pension benefits under
141 sections 86.200 to 86.366 at the rate that such
142 dependent's or spouse's coverage would cost
143 under the appropriate plan if the deceased were
144 living; and
145 (4) May pay an additional shift
146 differential compensation to commissioned and
147 civilian personnel for evening and night tours
148 of duty in an amount not to exceed ten percent
149 of the officer's base hourly rate.
150 10. A city not within a county that
151 establishes a municipal police force under
152 sections 84.343 to 84.346 shall establish a
153 transition committee of five members for the
154 purpose of: coordinating and implementing the
155 transition of authority, operations, assets, and
SB 1413 19
156 obligations from the board of police
157 commissioners to the city; winding down the
158 affairs of the board; making nonbinding
159 recommendations for the transition of the police
160 force from the board to the city; and other
161 related duties, if any, established by executive
162 order of the city's mayor. Once the ordinance
163 referenced in this section is enacted, the city
164 shall provide written notice to the board of
165 police commissioners and the governor of the
166 state of Missouri. Within thirty days of such
167 notice, the mayor shall appoint three members to
168 the committee, two of whom shall be members of a
169 statewide law enforcement association that
170 represents at least five thousand law
171 enforcement officers. The remaining members of
172 the committee shall include the police chief of
173 the municipal police force and a person who
174 currently or previously served as a commissioner
175 on the board of police commissioners, who shall
176 be appointed to the committee by the mayor of
177 such city.]
1 [84.345. 1. Except as required for the
2 board of police commissioners to conclude its
3 affairs and pursue legal claims and defenses,
4 upon the establishment of a municipal police
5 force, the terms of office of the commissioners
6 of the board of police created under sections
7 84.020 and 84.030 shall expire, and the
8 provisions of sections 84.010 to 84.340 shall
9 not apply to any city not within a county or its
10 municipal police force as of such date. The
11 board shall continue to operate, if necessary,
12 to wind down the board's affairs until the
13 transfer of ownership and obligations under
14 subsection 2 of section 84.344 has been
15 completed. During such time, the board of
16 police commissioners shall designate and
17 authorize its secretary to act on behalf of the
18 board for purposes of performing the board's
19 duties and any other actions incident to the
20 transfer and winding down of the board's affairs.
SB 1413 20
21 2. For any claim, lawsuit, or other action
22 arising out of actions occurring before the date
23 of completion of the transfer provided under
24 subsection 2 of section 84.344, the state shall
25 continue to provide legal representation as set
26 forth in section 105.726, and the state legal
27 expense fund shall continue to provide
28 reimbursement for such claims under section
29 105.726. This subsection applies to all claims,
30 lawsuits, and other actions brought against any
31 commissioner, police officer, employee, agent,
32 representative, or any individual or entity
33 acting or purporting to act on its or their
34 behalf.
35 3. Notwithstanding any other provision of
36 law, rule, or regulation to the contrary, any
37 city not within a county that establishes a
38 municipal police force under sections 84.343 to
39 84.346 shall not be restricted or limited in any
40 way in the selection of a police chief or chief
41 of the division created under subsection 8 of
42 section 84.344.
43 4. It shall be the duty of the sheriff for
44 any city not within a county, whenever called
45 upon by the police chief of the municipal police
46 force, to act under the police chief's control
47 for the preservation of the public peace and
48 quiet; and, whenever the exigency or
49 circumstances may, in the police chief's
50 judgment, warrant it, said police chief shall
51 have the power to assume the control and command
52 of all local and municipal conservators of the
53 peace of the city, whether sheriff, constable,
54 policemen or others, and they shall act under
55 the orders of the said police chief and not
56 otherwise.]
1 [84.346. Any police pension system created
2 under chapter 86 for the benefit of a police
3 force established under sections 84.010 to
4 84.340 shall continue to be governed by chapter
5 86, and shall apply to any police force
6 established under section 84.343 to 84.346.
7 Other than any provision that makes chapter 86
SB 1413 21
8 applicable to a municipal police force
9 established under section 84.343 to 84.346,
10 nothing in sections 84.343 to 84.346 shall be
11 construed as limiting or changing the rights or
12 benefits provided under chapter 86.]
1 [84.347. Notwithstanding the provisions of
2 section 1.140 to the contrary, the provisions of
3 sections 84.343 to 84.346 shall be
4 nonseverable. If any provision of sections
5 84.343 to 84.346 is for any reason held to be
6 invalid, such decision shall invalidate all of
7 the remaining provisions of this act.]
