13 promulgated by the department pursuant to sections 190.001
14 to 190.245.
15 3. The department shall issue a new ground ambulance

18 licensed by the department and is seeking to expand its

20 of this section, to be valid for a period of five years,

59 services for that political subdivision shall expand,
60 without further action by the department, the ambulance
61 service area of the licensed ambulance service to include
SB 1340 5
62 the jurisdictional boundaries of the political subdivision.
63 The termination of the aforementioned contract shall result
64 in a reduction of the licensed ambulance service's ambulance
65 service area by removing the geographic area of the
66 political subdivision from its ambulance service area,
67 except that licensed ambulance service providers may provide
68 ambulance services as are needed at and around the state
69 fair grounds for protection of attendees at the state fair.

71 service license if the applicant meets the requirements

99 information as the department deems necessary to make a
100 determination as to whether the ground ambulance service
101 meets all the requirements of sections 190.001 to 190.245
102 and rules promulgated pursuant to sections 190.001 to
103 190.245.

26 section.
1 190.166. 1. In addition to the provisions of section
2 190.165, the department of health and senior services may
3 refuse to issue, deny renewal of, or suspend a license
4 required pursuant to section 190.109, or take other
5 corrective actions as described in this section, based on
6 the following considerations:
7 (1) The license holder is determined to be financially
8 insolvent;
9 (2) The ambulance service has inadequate personnel to
10 operate the ambulance service to provide for basic emergency
11 operations, determined by the ability to staff a minimum of
12 one ambulance unit twenty-four hours per day, seven days per
13 week, with at least two licensed emergency medical
14 technicians and a reasonable plan and schedule for the
15 services of a second ambulance;
16 (3) The ambulance service requires an inordinate
17 amount of mutual aid from neighboring services, such as more
18 than ten percent of the total runs in the service area in
19 any given month, or than would be considered prudent and
20 thus cannot provide an appropriate level of emergency
21 response for the service area as would be considered prudent
22 by the typical ground ambulance services operator;
23 (4) The principal manager, board members, or other
24 executives are determined to be criminally liable for
25 actions related to the license or service provided;
26 (5) The license holder or principal manager, board
27 members, or other executives are determined by the Centers
SB 1340 8
28 for Medicare and Medicaid Services to be ineligible for
29 participation in Medicare;
30 (6) The license holder or principal manager, board
31 members, or other executives are determined by the MO
32 HealthNet division to be ineligible for participation in MO
33 HealthNet;
34 (7) The ambulance service administrator has failed to
35 meet the required qualifications or failed to complete the
36 training required pursuant to section 190.112; and
37 (8) Three or more board members have failed to
38 complete required training pursuant to section 190.053 if
39 the ambulance service is an ambulance district.
40 2. If the department makes a determination of
41 insolvency or insufficiency of operations of a license
42 holder under subsection 1 of this section, then the
43 department may require the license holder to submit a
44 corrective plan within fifteen days and require
45 implementation of the corrective plan within thirty days.
46 3. The department shall be required to provide notice
47 of any determination by the department of insolvency or
48 insufficiency of operations of a license holder to other
49 license holders operating in the license holder's vicinity,
50 members of the general assembly who represent the license
51 holder's service area, the governing officials of any county
52 or municipal entity in the license holder's service area,
53 the appropriate regional emergency medical services advisory
54 committee, and the state advisory council on emergency
55 medical services.
56 4. The department shall immediately engage with other
57 license holders in the area to determine the extent to which
58 ground ambulance service may be provided to the affected
59 service area during the time in which the license holder is
SB 1340 9
60 unable to provide adequate services, including any long-term
61 service arrangements. The nature of the agreement between
62 the license holder and other license holders providing
63 services to the affected area may include an agreement to
64 provide services, a joint powers agreement, formal
65 consideration, or some payment for services rendered.
66 5. Any license holder who provides assistance in the
67 service area of another license holder whose license has
68 been suspended under this section shall have the right to
69 seek reasonable compensation from the license holder whose
70 license to operate has been suspended for all calls, stand-
71 by time, and responses to medical emergencies during such
72 time as the license remains suspended. The reasonable
73 compensation shall not be limited to those expenses incurred
74 in actual responses, but may also include reasonable
75 expenses to maintain ambulance service, including, but not
76 limited to, the daily operation costs of maintaining the
77 service, personnel wages and benefits, equipment purchases
78 and maintenance, and other costs incurred in the operation
79 of a ground ambulance service. The license holder providing
80 assistance shall be entitled to an award of costs and
81 reasonable attorney fees in any action to enforce the
82 provisions of this subsection.
