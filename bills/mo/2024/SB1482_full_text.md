36 the [secretary] director or [secretary's] director's
37 designee may enter an order directing the family trust
38 company, family trust company affiliated party, or the
39 individual named in the notice of charges to cease and

42 effective when reduced to writing and served upon the family
43 trust company, family trust company affiliated party, or the
44 individual named therein. An uncontested cease and desist
45 order is effective as agreed.
46 5. If the [secretary] director or the [secretary's]
47 director's designee finds that conduct described under
48 subsection 1 of this section is likely to cause substantial
49 prejudice to members, [shareholders] stockholders,
50 beneficiaries of fiduciary accounts of the family trust
51 company, or beneficiaries of services rendered by the family
52 trust company, the [secretary] director or the [secretary's]
53 director's designee may issue an emergency cease and desist
54 order requiring the family trust company, family trust
55 company affiliated party, or individual named therein to
56 immediately cease and desist from engaging in the conduct
57 stated and to take corrective action. The emergency order
58 is effective immediately upon service of a copy of the order
59 upon the family trust company or family trust company
60 affiliated party and shall remain effective for ninety
61 days. If the [secretary] director or the [secretary's]
SB 1482 18
62 director's designee begins nonemergency cease and desist
63 proceedings under subsection 1 of this section, the
64 emergency order shall remain effective until the conclusion
65 of the proceedings under this section.
66 6. A family trust company shall have ninety days to
67 wind up its affairs after entry of any order to cease and
68 desist from operating as a family trust company. If a
69 family trust company that is not a foreign family trust
70 company is still operating after ninety days, the
71 [secretary] director or the [secretary's] director's
72 designee may seek an order from a circuit court for the
73 annulment or dissolution of the company. If a foreign
74 family trust company is still operating after ninety days,
75 the [secretary] director or the [secretary's] director's

6 the family trust company affiliated party is engaging or has
7 engaged in conduct that:
8 (1) Demonstrates that the family trust company does

10 a foreign family trust company under sections 362.1010 to
11 362.1117;

27 (9) Is an act of commission or omission or a practice
28 that the [secretary] director or the [secretary's]
SB 1482 20
29 director's designee has reason to believe is a breach of
30 trust or fiduciary duty.
31 2. The notice of charges shall contain a statement of
32 facts and notice of opportunity for a hearing.
33 3. If no hearing is requested within thirty days after
34 the date of service of the notice of charges or if a hearing
35 is held and the [secretary] director or [secretary's]
36 director's designee finds that any of the charges in the
37 notice of charges are true, the [secretary] director or
38 [secretary's] director's designee may enter an order that
39 removes the family trust company affiliated party from the
40 family trust company or that restricts or prohibits the
41 family trust company affiliated party from participating in
42 the affairs of the family trust company.
43 4. A contested or default order of removal is
44 effective when reduced to writing and served upon the family
45 trust company and the family trust company affiliated
46 party. An uncontested order of removal is effective as
47 agreed.
48 5. (1) The chief executive officer of a family trust
49 company or the person holding the equivalent office shall
50 promptly notify the [secretary] director if such person has
51 actual knowledge that a family trust company affiliated
52 party is charged with a felony in a state or federal court.
53 (2) If a family trust company affiliated party is
54 charged with a felony in a state or federal court or, in a
55 court of a foreign country with which the United States
56 maintains diplomatic relations, is charged with an offense
57 that involves a violation of law relating to fraud, currency
58 transaction reporting, money laundering, theft, or moral
59 turpitude and such offense is equivalent to a felony charge
60 under state or federal law, then the [secretary] director or
SB 1482 21
61 the [secretary's] director's designee may enter an emergency
62 order that suspends the family trust company affiliated
63 party or that restricts or prohibits participation by such
64 party in the affairs of the family trust company effective
65 upon service of the order on the company and such family
66 trust company affiliated party.
67 (3) The order shall contain notice of opportunity for
68 a hearing, at which the family trust company affiliated
69 party may request a postsuspension hearing to show that
70 continued service to or participation in the affairs of the
71 family trust company does not pose a threat to the interests
72 of the family trust company. In accordance with applicable
73 rules, the [secretary] director or [secretary's] director's
74 designee shall notify the family trust company affiliated
75 party whether the order suspending or prohibiting the family
76 trust company affiliated party from participating in the
77 affairs of the family trust company will be rescinded or
78 otherwise modified. The emergency order shall remain in
79 effect, unless otherwise modified by the [secretary]
80 director or [secretary's] director's designee, until the
81 criminal charge is disposed. The emergency order shall
82 dissolve upon the final, unappealed dismissal of all charges
83 against or the acquittal of the family trust company
84 affiliated party. Such occurrences shall not prohibit the
85 [secretary] director or the [secretary's] director's
86 designee from instituting proceedings under subsection 1 of
87 this section. If the family trust company affiliated party
88 charged is convicted or pleads guilty or nolo contendere,
89 regardless of adjudication, the emergency order shall become
90 final.
91 6. No family trust company affiliated party removed
92 from office under this section shall be eligible for
SB 1482 22
93 reinstatement to such office or to any other official
94 position in a family trust company or financial institution
95 in this state except with the written consent of the
96 [secretary] director. A family trust company affiliated
97 party who is removed, restricted, or prohibited from
98 participation in the affairs of a family trust company under
99 this section may petition the [secretary] director for
100 modification or termination of such removal, restriction, or
101 prohibition.
102 7. The resignation, termination of employment or
103 participation, or separation from a family trust company of
104 the family trust company affiliated party shall not affect
105 the jurisdiction and authority of the [secretary] director
106 or the [secretary's] director's designee to issue a notice
107 and proceed under this section against the family trust
108 company affiliated party if such notice is served within six
109 years of the date such person ceased to be a family trust
110 company affiliated party.

2 company are confidential and shall be made available for
3 inspection and examination only:

5 authorized representative] director's designee;
6 (2) To any person authorized to act for the family
7 trust company;
8 (3) As compelled by a court, pursuant to a subpoena
9 issued in accordance with state or federal law. Before the
10 production of the books and records, the party seeking
11 production shall agree to reimburse the company for the
12 reasonable costs and fees incurred in compliance with the
13 production. If the parties disagree on the amount of
14 reimbursement, the party seeking the records may request the
SB 1482 23
15 court that issued the subpoena to set the amount of
16 reimbursement;
17 (4) Pursuant to a subpoena held by any federal or
18 state law enforcement or prosecutorial instrumentality
19 authorized to investigate suspected criminal activity;

28 the determination of such person's voting rights.
29 (2) The books and records pertaining to customers,
30 members, and stockholders of a family trust company shall be
31 kept confidential by the company and its directors,

33 customers, members, and stockholders shall not be released
34 except upon the express authorization of the customer as to
35 his or her own accounts or a stockholder or member regarding
36 his or her voting rights. However, information may be
37 released without the authorization of a customer, member, or
38 [shareholder] stockholder in a manner prescribed by the
39 board of directors of a corporation or managers of a limited
40 liability company for the purposes of verifying or
41 corroborating the existence or amount of a customer's
42 account if such information is reasonably provided to meet
43 the needs of commerce and to ensure accurate credit
44 information. Notwithstanding this subdivision, this
45 subsection shall not prohibit a family trust company from
SB 1482 24
46 disclosing financial information as permitted under 15
47 U.S.C. Section 6802, as amended.
48 (3) The willful unlawful disclosure of confidential
49 information in violation of this section shall be a class E
50 felony.
51 (4) This subsection shall not apply to a foreign

12 representative] director's designee during the normal
13 business hours of the family trust company. A current list
14 of [shareholders] stockholders or members shall be made
15 available to the [secretary] director or the [secretary's
16 authorized representative] director's designee for their
SB 1482 25
17 inspection and, upon the request of the [secretary]
18 director, shall be submitted to the [secretary] director.

32 4. Orders issued by courts or administrative law
33 judges for the production of confidential records or
34 information shall provide for inspection in camera by the

36 administrative law judge determines that the documents
37 requested are relevant or would likely lead to the discovery
38 of admissible evidence, the documents shall be subject to
39 further orders by the court or the administrative law judge
40 to protect the confidentiality thereof. An order directing
41 the release of information shall be immediately reviewable,
42 and a petition by the [secretary] director for review of the
43 order shall automatically stay any further proceedings in a
44 trial court or administrative hearing until the disposition
45 of the petition by the reviewing court. If any other party
46 files a petition for review, such filing shall stay
47 proceedings only upon an order of the reviewing court.
