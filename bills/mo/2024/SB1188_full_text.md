AN ACT
To repeal sections 354.535 and 376.386, RSMo, and to enact in lieu thereof two new sections
relating to cost-sharing for prescription drugs.
Be it enacted by the General Assembly of the State of Missouri, as follows:
1 Section A. Sections 354.535 and 376.386, RSMo, are
2 repealed and two new sections enacted in lieu thereof, to be
3 known as sections 354.535 and 376.386, to read as follows:
1 354.535. 1. If a pharmacy, operated by or contracted
2 with by a health maintenance organization, is closed or is
3 unable to provide health care services to an enrollee in an
4 emergency, a pharmacist may take an assignment of such
5 enrollee's right to reimbursement, if the policy or contract
6 provides for such reimbursement, for those goods or services
7 provided to an enrollee of a health maintenance
8 organization. No health maintenance organization shall
9 refuse to pay the pharmacist any payment due the enrollee
10 under the terms of the policy or contract.
11 2. No health maintenance organization, conducting
12 business in the state of Missouri, shall contract with a
13 pharmacy, pharmacy distributor or wholesale drug
14 distributor, nonresident or otherwise, unless such pharmacy
15 or distributor has been granted a permit or license from the
16 Missouri board of pharmacy to operate in this state.
17 3. Every health maintenance organization shall apply
18 the same coinsurance, co-payment and deductible factors to
EXPLANATION-Matter enclosed in bold-faced brackets [thus] in this bill is not enacted
and is intended to be omitted in the law.
SB 1188 2
19 all drug prescriptions filled by a pharmacy provider who
20 participates in the health maintenance organization's
21 network if the provider meets the contract's explicit
22 product cost determination. If any such contract is
23 rejected by any pharmacy provider, the health maintenance
24 organization may offer other contracts necessary to comply
25 with any network adequacy provisions of this act. However,
26 nothing in this section shall be construed to prohibit the
27 health maintenance organization from applying different
28 coinsurance, co-payment and deductible factors between
29 generic and brand name drugs.
30 4. If the cost-sharing applied by a health maintenance
31 organization exceeds the usual and customary retail price of
32 the prescription drug, enrollees shall only be required to
33 pay the usual and customary retail price of the prescription
34 drug, and no further charge to the enrollee or plan sponsor
35 shall be incurred on such prescription.
36 5. Health maintenance organizations shall not set a
37 limit on the quantity of drugs which an enrollee may obtain
38 at any one time with a prescription, unless such limit is
39 applied uniformly to all pharmacy providers in the health
40 maintenance organization's network.
41 [5.] 6. Health maintenance organizations shall not
42 insist or mandate any physician or other licensed health
43 care practitioner to change an enrollee's maintenance drug
44 unless the provider and enrollee agree to such change. For
45 the purposes of this provision, a maintenance drug shall
46 mean a drug prescribed by a practitioner who is licensed to
47 prescribe drugs, used to treat a medical condition for a
48 period greater than thirty days. Violations of this
49 provision shall be subject to the penalties provided in
50 section 354.444. Notwithstanding other provisions of law to
SB 1188 3
51 the contrary, health maintenance organizations that change
52 an enrollee's maintenance drug without the consent of the
53 provider and enrollee shall be liable for any damages
54 resulting from such change. Nothing in this subsection,
55 however, shall apply to the dispensing of generically
56 equivalent products for prescribed brand name maintenance
57 drugs as set forth in section 338.056.
1 376.386. 1. For any health carrier or health benefit
2 plan, as defined in section 376.1350, that provides
3 prescription drug coverage, if a prescription drug covered
4 by a health carrier or health benefit plan is prescribed in
5 a single dosage amount for which the particular prescription
6 drug is not manufactured in such single dosage amount and
7 requires dispensing the particular prescription drug in a
8 combination of different manufactured dosage amounts, the
9 health carrier or health benefit plan shall only impose one
10 co-payment for the dispensing of the combination of
11 manufactured dosages that equal the prescribed dosage for
12 such prescription drug. Such co-payment requirement shall
13 not apply to prescriptions in excess of a one-month supply.
14 If technology does not permit such adjudication, the health
15 carrier or health benefit plan shall provide reimbursement
16 forms for the patient.
17 2. If the cost-sharing for prescription drugs applied
18 by a health carrier, as defined in section 376.1350, exceeds
19 the usual and customary retail price of the prescription
20 drug, enrollees shall only be required to pay the usual and
21 customary retail price of the prescription drug, and no
22 further charge to the enrollee or plan sponsor shall be
23 incurred on such prescription.
