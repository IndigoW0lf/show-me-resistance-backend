1 332.700. SECTION 1. TITLE AND PURPOSE
SB 778 8
2 This statute shall be known and cited as the Dentist
3 and Dental Hygienist Compact. The purposes of this Compact
4 are to facilitate the interstate practice of dentistry and
5 dental hygiene and improve public access to dentistry and
6 dental hygiene services by providing Dentists and Dental
7 Hygienists licensed in a Participating State the ability to
8 practice in Participating States in which they are not
9 licensed. The Compact does this by establishing a pathway
10 for Dentists and Dental Hygienists licensed in a
11 Participating State to obtain a Compact Privilege that
12 authorizes them to practice in another Participating State
13 in which they are not licensed. The Compact enables
14 Participating States to protect the public health and safety
15 with respect to the practice of such Dentists and Dental
16 Hygienists, through the State's authority to regulate the
17 practice of dentistry and dental hygiene in the State. The
18 Compact:
19 A. Enables Dentists and Dental Hygienists who qualify
20 for a Compact Privilege to practice in other Participating
21 States without satisfying burdensome and duplicative
22 requirements associated with securing a License to practice
23 in those States;
24 B. Promotes mobility and addresses workforce shortages
25 through each Participating State's acceptance of a Compact
26 Privilege to practice in that State;
27 C. Increases public access to qualified, licensed
28 Dentists and Dental Hygienists by creating a responsible,
29 streamlined pathway for Licensees to practice in
30 Participating States.
31 D. Enhances the ability of Participating States to
32 protect the public's health and safety;
SB 778 9
33 E. Does not interfere with licensure requirements
34 established by a Participating State;
35 F. Facilitates the sharing of licensure and
36 disciplinary information among Participating States;
37 G. Requires Dentists and Dental Hygienists who
38 practice in a Participating State pursuant to a Compact
39 Privilege to practice within the Scope of Practice
40 authorized in that State;
41 H. Extends the authority of a Participating State to
42 regulate the practice of dentistry and dental hygiene within
43 its borders to Dentists and Dental Hygienists who practice
44 in the State through a Compact Privilege;
45 I. Promotes the cooperation of Participating States in
46 regulating the practice of dentistry and dental hygiene
47 within those States;
48 J. Facilitates the relocation of military members and
49 their spouses who are licensed to practice dentistry or
50 dental hygiene;

328 may choose to charge a reduced fee or no fee to an Active
329 Military Member and their spouse for a Compact Privilege.
330 SECTION 6. ADVERSE ACTIONS
331 A. A Participating State in which a Licensee is

333 Action against the Qualifying License issued by that
334 Participating State.
335 B. A Participating State may take Adverse Action based
336 on the Significant Investigative Information of a Remote

338 procedures for imposing Adverse Action.
339 C. Nothing in this Compact shall override a
340 Participating State's decision that participation in an
341 Alternative Program may be used in lieu of Adverse Action
342 and that such participation shall remain non-public if
343 required by the Participating State's laws. Participating
344 States must require Licensees who enter any Alternative
SB 778 19
345 Program in lieu of discipline to agree not to practice
346 pursuant to a Compact Privilege in any other Participating
347 State during the term of the Alternative Program without
348 prior authorization from such other Participating State.
349 D. Any Participating State in which a Licensee is
350 applying to practice or is practicing pursuant to a Compact
351 Privilege may investigate actual or alleged violations of
352 the statutes and regulations authorizing the practice of
353 dentistry or dental hygiene in any other Participating State
354 in which the Dentist or Dental Hygienist holds a License or

360 under the Compact and the Commission's Rules issue subpoenas
361 for both hearings and investigations that require the
362 attendance and testimony of witnesses, and the production of
363 evidence. Subpoenas issued by a State Licensing Authority in
364 a Participating State for the attendance and testimony of
365 witnesses, or the production of evidence from another
366 Participating State, shall be enforced in the latter State
367 by any court of competent jurisdiction, according to the
368 practice and procedure of that court applicable to subpoenas
369 issued in proceedings pending before it. The issuing
370 authority shall pay any witness fees, travel expenses,
371 mileage, and other fees required by the service statutes of
372 the State where the witnesses or evidence are located; and
373 3. If otherwise permitted by State law, recover from
374 the Licensee the costs of investigations and disposition of
375 cases resulting from any Adverse Action taken against that
376 Licensee.
SB 778 20
377 F. Joint Investigations
378 1. In addition to the authority granted to a
379 Participating State by its Dentist or Dental Hygienist
380 licensure act or other applicable State law, a Participating
381 State may jointly investigate Licensees with other
382 Participating States.
383 2. Participating States shall share any Significant
384 Investigative Information, litigation, or compliance
385 materials in furtherance of any joint or individual
386 investigation initiated under the Compact.
387 G. Authority to Continue Investigation
388 1. After a Licensee's Compact Privilege in a Remote
389 State is terminated, the Remote State may continue an
390 investigation of the Licensee that began when the Licensee
391 had a Compact Privilege in that Remote State.
392 2. If the investigation yields what would be
393 Significant Investigative Information had the Licensee
394 continued to have a Compact Privilege in that Remote State,
395 the Remote State shall report the presence of such
396 information to the Data System as required by Section 8.B.6
397 as if it was Significant Investigative Information.
398 SECTION 7. ESTABLISHMENT AND OPERATION OF THE
399 COMMISSION.

778 order to effectively and efficiently implement and
779 administer the purposes and provisions of the Compact. A
780 Commission Rule shall be invalid and have no force or effect

785 hereunder, or based upon another applicable standard of
786 review.
787 B. The Rules of the Commission shall have the force of
788 law in each Participating State, provided however that where
SB 778 33
789 the Rules of the Commission conflict with the laws of the
790 Participating State that establish the Participating State's
791 Scope of Practice as held by a court of competent
792 jurisdiction, the Rules of the Commission shall be
793 ineffective in that State to the extent of the conflict.

800 a Commission Rule, by enactment of a statute or resolution
801 in the same manner used to adopt the Compact, within four
802 (4) years of the date of adoption of the Rule, then such
803 Rule shall have no further force and effect in any
804 Participating State or to any State applying to participate
805 in the Compact.
806 E. Rules shall be adopted at a regular or special
807 meeting of the Commission.

822 specify.
823 H. The Notice of Proposed Rulemaking shall include:
824 1. The time, date, and location of the public hearing
825 at which the Commission will hear public comments on the
826 proposed Rule and, if different, the time, date, and
827 location of the meeting where the Commission will consider
828 and vote on the proposed Rule;
829 2. If the hearing is held via telecommunication, video
830 conference, or other electronic means, the Commission shall
831 include the mechanism for access to the hearing in the
832 Notice of Proposed Rulemaking;
833 3. The text of the proposed Rule and the reason
834 therefor;
835 4. A request for comments on the proposed Rule from
836 any interested person; and
837 5. The manner in which interested persons may submit
838 written comments.
839 I. All hearings will be recorded. A copy of the
840 recording and all written comments and documents received by
841 the Commission in response to the proposed Rule shall be
842 available to the public.
843 J. Nothing in this section shall be construed as
844 requiring a separate hearing on each Commission Rule. Rules
845 may be grouped for the convenience of the Commission at
846 hearings required by this section.
847 K. The Commission shall, by majority vote of all
848 Commissioners, take final action on the proposed Rule based
849 on the rulemaking record.
850 1. The Commission may adopt changes to the proposed
851 Rule provided the changes do not enlarge the original
852 purpose of the proposed Rule.
SB 778 35
853 2. The Commission shall provide an explanation of the
854 reasons for substantive changes made to the proposed Rule as
855 well as reasons for substantive changes not made that were
856 recommended by commenters.
857 3. The Commission shall determine a reasonable
858 effective date for the Rule. Except for an emergency as
859 provided in subsection L, the effective date of the Rule
860 shall be no sooner than thirty (30) days after the
861 Commission issuing the notice that it adopted or amended the
862 Rule.
863 L. Upon determination that an emergency exists, the
864 Commission may consider and adopt an emergency Rule with 24
865 hours' notice, with opportunity to comment, provided that
866 the usual rulemaking procedures provided in the Compact and
867 in this section shall be retroactively applied to the Rule
868 as soon as reasonably possible, in no event later than
869 ninety (90) days after the effective date of the Rule. For
870 the purposes of this provision, an emergency Rule is one
871 that must be adopted immediately in order to:
872 1. Meet an imminent threat to public health, safety,
873 or welfare;
874 2. Prevent a loss of Commission or Participating State
875 funds;
876 3. Meet a deadline for the promulgation of a Rule that
877 is established by federal law or rule; or
878 4. Protect public health and safety.
879 M. The Commission or an authorized committee of the
880 Commission may direct revisions to a previously adopted Rule
881 for purposes of correcting typographical errors, errors in
882 format, errors in consistency, or grammatical errors.
883 Public notice of any revisions shall be posted on the
884 website of the Commission. The revision shall be subject to
SB 778 36
885 challenge by any person for a period of thirty (30) days
886 after posting. The revision may be challenged only on
887 grounds that the revision results in a material change to a
888 Rule. A challenge shall be made in writing and delivered to
889 the Commission prior to the end of the notice period. If no
890 challenge is made, the revision will take effect without
891 further action. If the revision is challenged, the revision
892 may not take effect without the approval of the Commission.
893 N. No Participating State's rulemaking requirements
894 shall apply under this Compact.
895 SECTION 10. OVERSIGHT, DISPUTE RESOLUTION, AND
896 ENFORCEMENT
897 A. Oversight
898 1. The executive and judicial branches of State
899 government in each Participating State shall enforce this
900 Compact and take all actions necessary and appropriate to
901 implement the Compact.
902 2. Venue is proper and judicial proceedings by or
903 against the Commission shall be brought solely and
904 exclusively in a court of competent jurisdiction where the
905 principal office of the Commission is located. The
906 Commission may waive venue and jurisdictional defenses to
907 the extent it adopts or consents to participate in
908 alternative dispute resolution proceedings. Nothing herein
909 shall affect or limit the selection or propriety of venue in
910 any action against a Licensee for professional malpractice,
911 misconduct or any such similar matter.
912 3. The Commission shall be entitled to receive service
913 of process in any proceeding regarding the enforcement or
914 interpretation of the Compact or Commission Rule and shall
915 have standing to intervene in such a proceeding for all
916 purposes. Failure to provide the Commission service of
SB 778 37
917 process shall render a judgment or order void as to the
918 Commission, this Compact, or promulgated Rules.
919 B. Default, Technical Assistance, and Termination
920 1. If the Commission determines that a Participating
921 State has defaulted in the performance of its obligations or
922 responsibilities under this Compact or the promulgated
923 Rules, the Commission shall provide written notice to the
924 defaulting State. The notice of default shall describe the
925 default, the proposed means of curing the default, and any
926 other action that the Commission may take, and shall offer
927 training and specific technical assistance regarding the
928 default.
929 2. The Commission shall provide a copy of the notice
930 of default to the other Participating States.
931 C. If a State in default fails to cure the default,
932 the defaulting State may be terminated from the Compact upon
933 an affirmative vote of a majority of the Commissioners, and
934 all rights, privileges and benefits conferred on that State
935 by this Compact may be terminated on the effective date of
936 termination. A cure of the default does not relieve the
937 offending State of obligations or liabilities incurred
938 during the period of default.
939 D. Termination of participation in the Compact shall
940 be imposed only after all other means of securing compliance
941 have been exhausted. Notice of intent to suspend or
942 terminate shall be given by the Commission to the governor,
943 the majority and minority leaders of the defaulting State's
944 legislature, the defaulting State's State Licensing
945 Authority or Authorities, as applicable, and each of the
946 Participating States' State Licensing Authority or
947 Authorities, as applicable.
SB 778 38
948 E. A State that has been terminated is responsible for
949 all assessments, obligations, and liabilities incurred
950 through the effective date of termination, including
951 obligations that extend beyond the effective date of
952 termination.
953 F. Upon the termination of a State's participation in
954 this Compact, that State shall immediately provide notice to
955 all Licensees of the State, including Licensees of other
956 Participating States issued a Compact Privilege to practice
957 within that State, of such termination. The terminated
958 State shall continue to recognize all Compact Privileges
959 then in effect in that State for a minimum of one hundred
960 eighty (180) days after the date of said notice of
961 termination.
962 G. The Commission shall not bear any costs related to
963 a State that is found to be in default or that has been
964 terminated from the Compact, unless agreed upon in writing
965 between the Commission and the defaulting State.
966 H. The defaulting State may appeal the action of the
967 Commission by petitioning the U.S. District Court for the
968 District of Columbia or the federal district where the
969 Commission has its principal offices. The prevailing party
970 shall be awarded all costs of such litigation, including
971 reasonable attorney's fees.
972 I. Dispute Resolution
973 1. Upon request by a Participating State, the
974 Commission shall attempt to resolve disputes related to the
975 Compact that arise among Participating States and between
976 Participating States and non-Participating States.
977 2. The Commission shall promulgate a Rule providing
978 for both mediation and binding dispute resolution for
979 disputes as appropriate.
SB 778 39
980 J. Enforcement
981 1. The Commission, in the reasonable exercise of its
982 discretion, shall enforce the provisions of this Compact and
983 the Commission's Rules.
984 2. By majority vote, the Commission may initiate legal
985 action against a Participating State in default in the
986 United States District Court for the District of Columbia or
987 the federal district where the Commission has its principal
988 offices to enforce compliance with the provisions of the
989 Compact and its promulgated Rules. The relief sought may
990 include both injunctive relief and damages. In the event
991 judicial enforcement is necessary, the prevailing party
992 shall be awarded all costs of such litigation, including
993 reasonable attorney's fees. The remedies herein shall not
994 be the exclusive remedies of the Commission. The Commission
995 may pursue any other remedies available under federal or the
996 defaulting Participating State's law.
997 3. A Participating State may initiate legal action
998 against the Commission in the U.S. District Court for the
999 District of Columbia or the federal district where the
1000 Commission has its principal offices to enforce compliance
1001 with the provisions of the Compact and its promulgated
1002 Rules. The relief sought may include both injunctive relief
1003 and damages. In the event judicial enforcement is
1004 necessary, the prevailing party shall be awarded all costs
1005 of such litigation, including reasonable attorney's fees.
1006 4. No individual or entity other than a Participating
1007 State may enforce this Compact against the Commission.
1008 SECTION 11. EFFECTIVE DATE, WITHDRAWAL, AND AMENDMENT
1009 A. The Compact shall come into effect on the date on
1010 which the Compact statute is enacted into law in the seventh
1011 Participating State.
SB 778 40
1012 1. On or after the effective date of the Compact, the
1013 Commission shall convene and review the enactment of each of
1014 the States that enacted the Compact prior to the Commission
1015 convening ("Charter Participating States") to determine if
1016 the statute enacted by each such Charter Participating State
1017 is materially different than the Model Compact.
1018 a. A Charter Participating State whose enactment is
1019 found to be materially different from the Model Compact
1020 shall be entitled to the default process set forth in
1021 Section 10.
1022 b. If any Participating State is later found to be in
1023 default, or is terminated or withdraws from the Compact, the
1024 Commission shall remain in existence and the Compact shall
1025 remain in effect even if the number of Participating States
1026 should be less than seven (7).
1027 2. Participating States enacting the Compact
1028 subsequent to the Charter Participating States shall be
1029 subject to the process set forth in Section 7.C.23 to
1030 determine if their enactments are materially different from
1031 the Model Compact and whether they qualify for participation
1032 in the Compact.
1033 3. All actions taken for the benefit of the Commission
1034 or in furtherance of the purposes of the administration of
1035 the Compact prior to the effective date of the Compact or
1036 the Commission coming into existence shall be considered to
1037 be actions of the Commission unless specifically repudiated
1038 by the Commission.
1039 4. Any State that joins the Compact subsequent to the
1040 Commission's initial adoption of the Rules and bylaws shall
1041 be subject to the Commission's Rules and bylaws as they
1042 exist on the date on which the Compact becomes law in that
1043 State. Any Rule that has been previously adopted by the
SB 778 41
1044 Commission shall have the full force and effect of law on
1045 the day the Compact becomes law in that State.
1046 B. Any Participating State may withdraw from this
1047 Compact by enacting a statute repealing that State's
1048 enactment of the Compact.
1049 1. A Participating State's withdrawal shall not take
1050 effect until one hundred eighty (180) days after enactment
1051 of the repealing statute.
1052 2. Withdrawal shall not affect the continuing
1053 requirement of the withdrawing State's Licensing Authority
1054 or Authorities to comply with the investigative and Adverse
1055 Action reporting requirements of this Compact prior to the
1056 effective date of withdrawal.
1057 3. Upon the enactment of a statute withdrawing from
1058 this Compact, the State shall immediately provide notice of
1059 such withdrawal to all Licensees within that State.
1060 Notwithstanding any subsequent statutory enactment to the
1061 contrary, such withdrawing State shall continue to recognize
1062 all Compact Privileges to practice within that State granted
1063 pursuant to this Compact for a minimum of one hundred eighty
1064 (180) days after the date of such notice of withdrawal.
1065 C. Nothing contained in this Compact shall be
1066 construed to invalidate or prevent any licensure agreement
1067 or other cooperative arrangement between a Participating
1068 State and a non-Participating State that does not conflict
1069 with the provisions of this Compact.
1070 D. This Compact may be amended by the Participating
1071 States. No amendment to this Compact shall become effective
1072 and binding upon any Participating State until it is enacted
1073 into the laws of all Participating States.
1074 SECTION 12. CONSTRUCTION AND SEVERABILITY
SB 778 42
1075 A. This Compact and the Commission's rulemaking
1076 authority shall be liberally construed so as to effectuate
1077 the purposes, and the implementation and administration of
1078 the Compact. Provisions of the Compact expressly
1079 authorizing or requiring the promulgation of Rules shall not
1080 be construed to limit the Commission's rulemaking authority
1081 solely for those purposes.
1082 B. The provisions of this Compact shall be severable
1083 and if any phrase, clause, sentence or provision of this
1084 Compact is held by a court of competent jurisdiction to be
1085 contrary to the constitution of any Participating State, a
1086 State seeking participation in the Compact, or of the United
1087 States, or the applicability thereof to any government,
1088 agency, person or circumstance is held to be
1089 unconstitutional by a court of competent jurisdiction, the
1090 validity of the remainder of this Compact and the
1091 applicability thereof to any other government, agency,
1092 person or circumstance shall not be affected thereby.
1093 C. Notwithstanding subsection B of this section, the
1094 Commission may deny a State's participation in the Compact
1095 or, in accordance with the requirements of Section 10.B,
1096 terminate a Participating State's participation in the
1097 Compact, if it determines that a constitutional requirement
1098 of a Participating State is a material departure from the
1099 Compact. Otherwise, if this Compact shall be held to be
1100 contrary to the constitution of any Participating State, the
1101 Compact shall remain in full force and effect as to the
1102 remaining Participating States and in full force and effect
1103 as to the Participating State affected as to all severable
1104 matters.
1105 SECTION 13. CONSISTENT EFFECT AND CONFLICT WITH OTHER
1106 STATE LAWS
SB 778 43
1107 A. Nothing herein shall prevent or inhibit the
1108 enforcement of any other law of a Participating State that
1109 is not inconsistent with the Compact.
1110 B. Any laws, statutes, regulations, or other legal
1111 requirements in a Participating State in conflict with the
1112 Compact are superseded to the extent of the conflict.
1113 C. All permissible agreements between the Commission
1114 and the Participating States are binding in accordance with
1115 their terms.
