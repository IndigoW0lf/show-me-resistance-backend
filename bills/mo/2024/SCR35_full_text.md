SENATE CONCURRENT RESOLUTION NO. 35
Whereas, the Weldon Spring Site was historically used
to process uranium and left damage to the environment and
health of the local residents; and
Whereas, the community surrounding the Weldon Spring
Site has been affected by nuclear contamination in the name
of national security; and
Whereas, the Radiation Exposure Compensation Act (RECA)
represents a critical means of providing compensation to the
affected populations and acknowledgment of the damage from
the nuclear exposure; and
Whereas, the expiration of RECA would deny justice to
the individuals currently affected by the nuclear exposure
and would fail future generations that may feel the effects
of the nuclear exposure; and
Whereas, the reauthorization of RECA is not only a
financial matter but a moral imperative to right the past
wrongs; and
Whereas, it is the duty of Missouri's elected officials
to ensure justice for those within the state's borders who
have suffered from the government-induced nuclear radiation
exposure:
Now Therefore Be It Resolved that the members of the
Missouri Senate, One Hundred Second General Assembly, second
Regular Session, the House of Representatives concurring
therein, hereby urge the United States Congress to swiftly
reauthorize and update the RECA; and
Be It Further Resolved that the Secretary of the Senate
be instructed to prepare a property inscribed copy of this
resolution for the United States Senate, to the Speaker of
1
the United States House of Representatives, and to the
members of the Missouri congressional delegation.
