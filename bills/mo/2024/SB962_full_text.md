AN ACT
To repeal sections 92.105, 92.111, and 92.115, RSMo, and to enact in lieu thereof three new
sections relating to earnings tax.
Be it enacted by the General Assembly of the State of Missouri, as follows:
1 Section A. Sections 92.105, 92.111, and 92.115, RSMo, are
2 repealed and three new sections enacted in lieu thereof, to be
3 known as sections 92.105, 92.111, and 92.115, to read as
4 follows:

2 that starting in 2011 voters in any city imposing an

4 earnings tax. If the majority of local voters vote to
5 continue the earnings tax, it will continue for five years,
6 or in any city with more than four hundred thousand
7 inhabitants and located in more than one county, for ten
8 years, and then will be voted on again. If a majority of
9 voters in any city having an earnings tax vote against
10 continuing the earnings tax, it will be phased out pursuant
11 to section 92.125 in such city over a period of ten years.
12 Further, sections 92.105 to 92.125 prohibit any Missouri
13 city or town that does not, as of November 2, 2010, impose
14 an earnings tax, from imposing such a tax on residents and
15 businesses.

7 whether to continue such earnings tax for a period of five
8 years, or if such city with more than four hundred thousand
9 inhabitants and located in more than one county, for a
10 period of ten years, and a majority of such qualified voters
11 voting thereon approve such question, however, if no such
12 election is held, or if in any election held to continue to
13 impose or levy the earnings tax a majority of such qualified
14 voters voting thereon fail to approve the continuation of
15 the earnings tax, such city shall no longer be authorized to
