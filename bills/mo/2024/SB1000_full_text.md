185 boundaries of the eligible project area in the application.
186 The department shall verify that the applicant has submitted

188 department. The department shall verify that the municipal
189 authority held the requisite hearings and gave the requisite
190 notices for such hearings in accordance with the applicable

207 million dollars.] At no time shall the annual amount of the
SB 1000 8
208 tax credits issued under this section exceed twenty million
209 dollars. If the tax credits that are to be issued under
210 this section exceed, in any year, the twenty million dollar
211 limitation, the department shall either:
212 (1) Issue tax credits to the applicant in the amount
213 of twenty million dollars, if there is only one applicant
214 entitled to receive tax credits in that year; or
215 (2) Issue the tax credits on a pro rata basis to all
216 applicants entitled to receive tax credits in that year.
217 Any amount of tax credits, which an applicant is, or
218 applicants are, entitled to receive on an annual basis and
219 are not issued due to the twenty million dollar limitation,
220 shall be carried forward for the benefit of the applicant or
221 applicants to subsequent years.
222 No tax credits provided under this section shall be
223 authorized after August 28, [2013] 2030. Any tax credits
224 which have been authorized on or before August 28, [2013]
225 2030, but not issued, may be issued, subject to the
226 limitations provided under this subsection, until all such
227 authorized tax credits have been issued.
228 8. Upon issuance of any tax credits pursuant to this
229 section, the department shall report to the municipal
230 authority the applicant's name and address, the parcel
231 numbers of the eligible parcels for which the tax credits
232 were issued, the itemized acquisition costs and interest
233 costs for which tax credits were issued, and the total value
234 of the tax credits issued. The municipal authority and the
235 state shall not consider the amount of the tax credits as an
236 applicant's cost, but shall include the tax credits in any
237 sources and uses and cost benefit analysis reviewed or
238 created for the purpose of awarding other economic
SB 1000 9
239 incentives. The amount of the tax credits shall not be
240 considered an applicant's cost in the evaluation of the
241 amount of any award of any other economic incentives, but
242 shall be considered in measuring the reasonableness of the
243 rate of return to the applicant with respect to such award
244 of other economic incentives. The municipal authority shall
245 provide the report to any relevant commission, board, or
246 entity responsible for the evaluation and recommendation or
247 approval of other economic incentives to assist in the
248 redevelopment of the eligible project area. Tax credits
249 authorized under this section shall constitute redevelopment
250 tax credits, as such term is defined under section 135.800,
251 and shall be subject to all provisions applicable to
252 redevelopment tax credits provided under sections 135.800 to
253 135.830.
254 9. The department may promulgate rules to implement
255 the provisions of this section. Any rule or portion of a
256 rule, as that term is defined in section 536.010, that is
257 created under the authority delegated in this section shall
258 become effective only if it complies with and is subject to
259 all of the provisions of chapter 536 and, if applicable,
260 section 536.028. This section and chapter 536 are
261 nonseverable and if any of the powers vested with the
262 general assembly pursuant to chapter 536 to review, to delay
263 the effective date, or to disapprove and annul a rule are
264 subsequently held unconstitutional, then the grant of
265 rulemaking authority and any rule proposed or adopted after
266 August 28, 2007, shall be invalid and void.
