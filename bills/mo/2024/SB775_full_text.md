To repeal sections 541.033, 562.071, 563.026, and 565.002, RSMo, and to enact in lieu thereof
five new sections relating to the protection of unborn children, with a referendum
clause.
Be it enacted by the General Assembly of the State of Missouri, as follows:
1 Section A. Sections 541.033, 562.071, 563.026, and
2 565.002, RSMo, are repealed and five new sections enacted in
3 lieu thereof, to be known as sections 1.207, 541.033, 562.071,
4 563.026, and 565.002, to read as follows:
1 1.207. 1. This section shall be known and may be
2 cited as the "Abolition of Abortion in Missouri Act".
3 2. Acknowledging the sanctity of innocent human life,
4 created in the image of God, it is the intent of the general
5 assembly:
6 (1) To follow Article I, Section 2, of the Missouri
7 Constitution, which provides, "That all constitutional
8 government is intended to promote the general welfare of the
9 people; that all persons have a natural right to life,
10 liberty, the pursuit of happiness and the enjoyment of the
11 gains of their own industry; that all persons are created
12 equal and are entitled to equal rights and opportunity under
13 the law; that to give security to these things is the
14 principal office of government, and that when government
15 does not confer this security, it fails in its chief
16 design.";
EXPLANATION-Matter enclosed in bold-faced brackets [thus] in this bill is not enacted
and is intended to be omitted in the law.
SB 775 2
17 (2) Pursuant to section 1.205, to acknowledge on
18 behalf of the unborn child at every stage of development,
19 all the rights, privileges, and immunities available to
20 other persons, citizens, and residents of this state;
21 (3) To follow the Constitution of the United States,
22 which requires that "no state...shall deny to any person
23 within its jurisdiction the equal protection of the laws";
24 (4) To fulfill such constitutional and statutory
25 requirements by protecting the lives of unborn persons with
26 the same criminal and civil laws protecting the lives of
27 born persons by repealing provisions that permit willful
28 prenatal homicide or assault;
29 (5) To ensure that all persons potentially subject to
30 such laws are entitled to due process protections; and
31 (6) To abolish abortion in this state.
32 3. Unless specifically provided otherwise, enforcement
33 is subject to the same presumptions, defenses,
34 justifications, laws of parties, immunities, and clemencies
35 as would apply where the victim is a person who had been
36 born alive.
1 541.033. 1. Persons accused of committing offenses
2 against the laws of this state, except as may be otherwise
3 provided by law, shall be prosecuted:
4 (1) In the county in which the offense is committed; or
5 (2) If the offense is committed partly in one county
6 and partly in another, or if the elements of the crime occur
7 in more than one county, then in any of the counties where
8 any element of the offense occurred.
9 2. Persons accused of committing the offenses of
10 identity theft against the laws of this state in sections
11 570.223, 570.224, and 575.120 shall be prosecuted:
12 (1) In the county in which the offense is committed;
SB 775 3
13 (2) If the offense is committed partly in one county
14 and partly in another, or if the elements of the offense
15 occur in more than one county, then in any of the counties
16 where any element of the offense occurred;
17 (3) In the county in which the victim resides; or
18 (4) In the county in which the property obtained or
19 attempted to be obtained was located.
20 3. Persons accused of committing an offense against
21 the laws of this state under chapter 565 where the victim is
22 an unborn child shall be prosecuted:
23 (1) In the county in which the offense is committed;
24 (2) If the offense is committed partly in one county
25 and partly in another, or if the elements of the offense
26 occur in more than one county, then in any of the counties
27 where any element of the offense occurred;
28 (3) In the county in which the accused resides;
29 (4) In the county in which the victim resides; or
30 (5) In the county in which the accused is apprehended.
1 562.071. 1. It is an affirmative defense that the
2 defendant engaged in the conduct charged to constitute an
3 offense because he or she was coerced to do so, by the use
4 of, or threatened imminent use of, unlawful physical force
5 upon him or her or a third person, which force or threatened
6 force a person of reasonable firmness in his situation would
7 have been unable to resist.
8 2. The defense of "duress" as defined in subsection 1
9 is not available:
10 (1) As to the [crime] offense of murder, except where
11 the victim is an unborn child and the defendant is the
12 child's mother;
13 (2) As to any offense when the defendant recklessly
14 places himself or herself in a situation in which it is
SB 775 4
15 probable that he or she will be subjected to the force or
16 threatened force described in subsection 1 of this section.
1 563.026. 1. Unless inconsistent with other provisions
2 of this chapter defining justifiable use of physical force,
3 or with some other provision of law, conduct which would
4 otherwise constitute any offense other than a class A felony
5 or murder is justifiable and not criminal when it is
6 necessary as an emergency measure to avoid an imminent
7 public or private injury which is about to occur by reason
8 of a situation occasioned or developed through no fault of
9 the actor, and which is of such gravity that, according to
10 ordinary standards of intelligence and morality, the
11 desirability of avoiding the injury outweighs the
12 desirability of avoiding the injury sought to be prevented
13 by the statute defining the offense charged.
14 2. The necessity and justifiability of conduct under
15 subsection 1 of this section may not rest upon
16 considerations pertaining only to the morality and
17 advisability of the statute, either in its general
18 application or with respect to its application to a
19 particular class of cases arising thereunder. Whenever
20 evidence relating to the defense of justification under this
21 section is offered, the court shall rule as a matter of law
22 whether the claimed facts and circumstances would, if
23 established, constitute a justification.
24 3. Conduct which would otherwise constitute any
25 offense is justifiable and not criminal when it is a lawful
26 medical procedure:
27 (1) Performed by a licensed physician;
28 (2) Performed on a pregnant female to avert the death
29 of the pregnant female;
SB 775 5
30 (3) That results in the accidental or unintentional
31 death of the unborn child the pregnant female is carrying;
32 and
33 (4) Performed when all reasonable alternatives to save
34 the life of the unborn child:
35 (a) Are unavailable; or
36 (b) Were attempted unsuccessfully before the
37 performance of the medical procedure.
38 4. The defense of justification under this section is
39 an affirmative defense.
