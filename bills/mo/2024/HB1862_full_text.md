6 groups of public utilities: electrical corporations, gas corporations, water corporations,

11 utilities.

13 expenses directly attributable to the regulation of such group and an amount equal to such
14 proportion of the estimated expenses not directly attributable to any group as the gross

18 amount so allocated to each group of public utilities, subject to reduction as herein provided,
19 to the public utilities in such group in proportion to their respective gross intrastate operating
20 revenues during the preceding calendar year, except that the total amount so assessed to all
21 such public utilities shall not exceed three hundred fifteen thousandths of one percent of the
22 total gross intrastate operating revenues of all utilities subject to the jurisdiction of the
23 commission. Beginning January 1, 2025, the total amount assessed on the total gross
24 intrastate operating revenues of all utilities subject to the jurisdiction of the commission
25 shall not exceed three hundred fifty thousandths of one percent and shall increase every
26 two years thereafter by one hundredth of one percent until such time as the maximum
27 amount available to be assessed is equal to one-half of one percent. All corporations
28 subject to the jurisdiction of the commission shall defer to an asset or liability account
29 any difference in the assessment actually incurred and the assessment on which the
30 revenue requirement used to set rates in the corporation's most recently completed
31 general rate proceeding was based. The asset or liability account balances shall be
32 included in the revenue requirement used to set rates through an amortization over a
33 reasonable period of time in such corporation's subsequent general rate proceedings.
34 The commission shall also adjust the rate base used to establish the revenue
35 requirement of the utility to reflect the unamortized asset or liability account balance
36 in such general rate proceedings.
37 3. The commission shall render a statement of such assessment to each such public
38 utility on or before July first and the amount so assessed to each such public utility shall be
39 paid by it to the director of revenue in full on or before July fifteenth next following the
40 rendition of such statement, except that any such public utility may at its election pay such
41 assessment in four equal installments not later than the following dates next following the
42 rendition of said statement, to wit: July fifteenth, October fifteenth, January fifteenth and
43 April fifteenth. The director of revenue shall remit such payments to the state treasurer.
44 4. The state treasurer shall credit such payments to a special fund, which is hereby
45 created, to be known as "The Public Service Commission Fund", which fund, or its successor
46 fund created pursuant to section 33.571, shall be devoted solely to the payment of
47 expenditures actually incurred by the commission and attributable to the regulation of such
48 public utilities subject to the jurisdiction of the commission, as aforesaid. Any amount
49 remaining in such special fund or its successor fund at the end of any fiscal year shall not
50 revert to the general revenue fund, but shall be applicable by appropriation of the general

58 shall file with the commission, within ten days after August 28, 1996, and thereafter on or
59 before March thirty-first of each year, a statement under oath showing its gross intrastate
