115 including annual performance reports, of students enrolled in the charter school. The state
116 board of education shall approve or deny a charter application within sixty days of receipt of

118 application fails to meet the requirements of sections 160.400 to 160.425 and section 167.349
119 or that a charter sponsor previously failed to meet the statutory responsibilities of a charter
120 sponsor. Any denial of a charter application made by the state board of education shall be in
121 writing and shall identify the specific failures of the application to meet the requirements of
HRB 1 29

180 held to lower performance standards than other public schools within a district; however, the
181 charter of a charter school may permit students to meet performance standards on a different
182 time frame as specified in its charter. The performance standards for alternative and special
183 purpose charter schools that target high-risk students as defined in subdivision (5) of
184 subsection 2 of this section shall be based on measures defined in the school's performance

23 motor vehicle that is accessible to the director of revenue. If satisfied that the applicant is the

85 inspection and verification has been made in this state, except that if such vehicle has been
86 inspected in another state by a law enforcement officer in a manner comparable to the
87 inspection process in this state and the vehicle identification numbers have been so verified,
88 the applicant shall not be liable for the twenty-five dollar inspection fee if such applicant
89 submits proof of inspection and vehicle identification number verification to the director of

91 which no prior inspection and verification have been made, shall pay a fee of twenty-five

135 salvage designation shall be carried forward on all subsequently issued certificates of title for
136 the motor vehicle.

143 9. For tax credits for the creation of new jobs under section 620.2010, the department
144 shall allocate the annual tax credits based on the date of the approval, reserving such tax
145 credits based on the department's best estimate of new jobs and new payroll of the project,
146 and any other applicable factors in determining the amount of benefits available to the
147 qualified company or qualified military project under this program; provided that, the
148 department may reserve up to twenty-one and one-half percent of the maximum annual
149 amount of tax credits that may be authorized under subsection 7 of this section for award
150 under subsection 7 of section 620.2010. However, the annual issuance of tax credits shall be
151 subject to annual verification of actual payroll by the department or, for qualified military

153 military project. Any authorization of tax credits shall expire if, within two years from the
154 date of commencement of operations, or approval if applicable, the qualified company has
155 failed to meet the applicable minimum job requirements. The qualified company may retain
156 authorized amounts from the withholding tax under the project once the applicable minimum

160 section 620.2010, until the qualified company has satisfied the requirements set forth in the
161 written agreement between the department and the qualified company under subsection 4 of
162 section 620.2010. In the event the qualified company or qualified military project does not
163 meet the applicable minimum new job requirements, the qualified company or qualified

169 within one year of the close of the taxable year for which they were issued. Tax credits
170 provided under this program may be transferred, sold, or assigned by filing a notarized
171 endorsement thereof with the department that names the transferee, the amount of tax credit
172 transferred, and the value received for the credit, as well as any other information reasonably
173 requested by the department. For a qualified company with flow-through tax treatment to its
174 members, partners, or shareholders, the tax credit shall be allowed to members, partners, or
175 shareholders in proportion to their share of ownership on the last day of the qualified
176 company's tax period.
177 11. Prior to the issuance of tax credits or the qualified company beginning to retain
178 withholding taxes, the department shall verify through the department of revenue and any
179 other applicable state department that the tax credit applicant does not owe any delinquent
180 income, sales, or use tax or interest or penalties on such taxes, or any delinquent fees or

182 insurance that the applicant does not owe any delinquent insurance taxes or other fees. Such
183 delinquency shall not affect the approval, except that any tax credits issued shall be first
184 applied to the delinquency and any amount issued shall be reduced by the applicant's tax
185 delinquency. Ifthedepartmentofrevenue,thedepartmentofcommerceandinsurance,orany

188 deficiency on behalf of the taxpayer to arise, then the taxpayer shall be granted thirty days to
189 satisfy the deficiency in which interest, penalties, and additions to tax shall be tolled. After
190 applying all available credits toward a tax delinquency, the administering agency shall notify
191 the appropriate department and that department shall update the amount of outstanding
192 delinquent tax owed by the applicant. If any credits remain after satisfying all insurance,
193 income, sales, and use tax delinquencies, the remaining credits shall be issued to the
194 applicant, subject to the restrictions of other provisions of law.

66 ownership interest vested in the purchaser of the vehicle for all purposes other
67 than for a subsequent transfer of ownership of the vehicle by the purchaser,
68 subject to the rights of any secured lienholder of record; however, the

106 deliver the duplicate or replacement certificate of ownership to the purchaser
107 by the date agreed upon by the dealer and the purchaser, as required by

110 duplicate title provided by the dealer to the purchaser, a copy of the secure
111 power of attorney allowing the dealer to assign the duplicate title, and the
112 proof or other evidence obtained by the purchaser from the dealer under
113 subsection 3 of this section. Thereafter, the director shall mail by certified

115 the department by that dealer. That notice shall inform the dealer that the
116 director intends to cancel any prior certificate of title which may have been
117 issued to the dealer on the vehicle and issue to the purchaser a certificate of
118 title in the name of the purchaser, subject to any liens incurred by the
119 purchaser in connection with the purchase of the vehicle, unless the dealer,

133 each such party for actual and punitive damages, plus court costs and
134 reasonable attorney fees.
135 8. When a lienholder is damaged as a result of a licensed dealer's acts,
136 errors, omissions, or violations of this section, then the dealer shall be liable to
