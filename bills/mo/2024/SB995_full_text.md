21 conditions or circumstances which would reasonably result in
22 abuse or neglect, that person shall immediately report to
23 the division in accordance with the provisions of sections
24 210.109 to 210.183. No internal investigation shall be
25 initiated until such a report has been made. As used in
26 this section, the term "abuse" is not limited to abuse
27 inflicted by a person responsible for the child's care,
28 custody and control as specified in section 210.110, but
29 shall also include abuse inflicted by any other person.
30 2. If two or more members of a medical institution who
31 are required to report jointly have knowledge of a known or
32 suspected instance of child abuse or neglect, a single
SB 995 5
33 report may be made by a designated member of that medical
34 team. Any member who has knowledge that the member
35 designated to report has failed to do so shall thereafter
36 immediately make the report. Nothing in this section,
37 however, is meant to preclude any person from reporting
38 abuse or neglect.

40 individual, and no supervisor or administrator may impede or
41 inhibit any reporting under this section. No person making
42 a report under this section shall be subject to any

44 making such report. Every employer shall ensure that any
45 employee required to report pursuant to subsection 1 of this
46 section has immediate and unrestricted access to

48 report and is temporarily relieved of other work duties for
49 such time as is required to make any report required under
50 subsection 1 of this section.
51 4. Notwithstanding any other provision of sections
52 210.109 to 210.183, any child who does not receive specified
53 medical treatment by reason of the legitimate practice of
54 the religious belief of the child's parents, guardian, or
55 others legally responsible for the child, for that reason
56 alone, shall not be found to be an abused or neglected
57 child, and such parents, guardian or other persons legally
58 responsible for the child shall not be entered into the
59 central registry. However, the division may accept reports
60 concerning such a child and may subsequently investigate or
61 conduct a family assessment as a result of that report.
62 Such an exception shall not limit the administrative or
63 judicial authority of the state to ensure that medical
SB 995 6
64 services are provided to the child when the child's health
65 requires it.
66 5. In addition to those persons and officials required
67 to report actual or suspected abuse or neglect, any other
68 person may report in accordance with sections 210.109 to
69 210.183 if such person has reasonable cause to suspect that
70 a child has been or may be subjected to abuse or neglect or
71 observes a child being subjected to conditions or
72 circumstances which would reasonably result in abuse or
73 neglect.
74 6. Any person or official required to report pursuant
75 to this section, including employees of the division, who
76 has probable cause to suspect that a child who is or may be
77 under the age of eighteen, who is eligible to receive a
78 certificate of live birth, has died shall report that fact
79 to the appropriate medical examiner or coroner. If, upon
80 review of the circumstances and medical information, the
81 medical examiner or coroner determines that the child died
82 of natural causes while under medical care for an
83 established natural disease, the coroner, medical examiner
84 or physician shall notify the division of the child's death
85 and that the child's attending physician shall be signing
86 the death certificate. In all other cases, the medical
87 examiner or coroner shall accept the report for
88 investigation, shall immediately notify the division of the
89 child's death as required in section 58.452 and shall report
90 the findings to the child fatality review panel established
91 pursuant to section 210.192.
92 7. Any person or individual required to report may
93 also report the suspicion of abuse or neglect to any law
94 enforcement agency or juvenile office. Such report shall
95 not, however, take the place of reporting to the division.
SB 995 7
96 8. If an individual required to report suspected
97 instances of abuse or neglect pursuant to this section has
98 reason to believe that the victim of such abuse or neglect
99 is a resident of another state or was injured as a result of
100 an act which occurred in another state, the person required
101 to report such abuse or neglect may, in lieu of reporting to
102 the Missouri children's division, make such a report to the
103 child protection agency of the other state with the
104 authority to receive such reports pursuant to the laws of
105 such other state. If such agency accepts the report, no
106 report is required to be made, but may be made, to the
107 children's division.
108 9. For the purposes of providing supportive services
109 or verifying the status of a youth as unaccompanied or
110 homeless for the purposes of accessing supportive services,
111 the fact that a child is an unaccompanied youth as defined
112 in 42 U.S.C. Section 11434a(6) is not, in and of itself, a
113 sufficient basis for reporting child abuse or neglect,
114 unless the child is under sixteen years of age or is an
115 incapacitated person, as defined in section 475.010.
116 Nothing in this subsection shall limit a mandated reporter
117 from making a report under this section if the mandated
118 reporter knows or has reasonable cause to suspect that an
119 unaccompanied youth has been or may be a victim of abuse or
120 neglect.

8 care has reasonable cause to suspect that a companion animal
9 has been or may be subjected to abuse or neglect or observes

29 neglect, MACA shall provide the report to any duly-
30 authorized law enforcement official, county or municipal
31 animal control officer, or any Missouri peace officer
32 standards and training (POST)-certified or MACA-certified
33 animal cruelty investigator.
34 4. Any person required to report companion animal
