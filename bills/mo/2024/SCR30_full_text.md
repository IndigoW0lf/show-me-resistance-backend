SENATE CONCURRENT RESOLUTION NO. 30
Whereas, a century ago, in October 1924, Ireland
formally opened diplomatic relations with the United States
of America when Timothy Smiddy presented his credentials to
President Calvin Coolidge. Following the Irish people's
long and painful struggle for independence, the U.S. was one
of the first nations to recognize the fledgling Irish state
earlier that year, and when Smiddy emerged from the White
House, he had become Ireland's first Ambassador to any
country in the world. It was very appropriate that
Ireland's first representative overseas should be dispatched
to Washington, D.C. for, while 1924 marked the beginning of
formal diplomatic relations, the deep Irish-American
connection dated back centuries; and
Whereas, today, nearly one-tenth of Americans identify
as being of Irish ancestry. Irish immigrants helped build
the America we know today, not only the physical
infrastructure from the skyscrapers of Manhattan to the
transcontinental railroad, but also the political construct
that is America; and
Whereas, Irish people have made an enormous
contribution to public debate and politics in America, from
their local communities right up to the White House. More
than twenty American Presidents claimed some Irish
ancestry. But the influence of Irish America extends well
beyond the Oval Office and the Capitol building, to every
state within the Union, most evident in the significant
number of state legislators within the American Irish State
Legislators Caucus; and
Whereas, since Timothy Smiddy's momentous audience in
the Oval Office 100 years ago, a further eighteen Irish
1
Ambassadors have presented credentials to U.S. Presidents.
Over this time, Ireland's relations with the United States
have evolved significantly. From an impoverished and
internationally isolated state, scarred by years of
conflict, Ireland has transformed over the past century.
Ireland today is at peace, economically prosperous, and
culturally vibrant; and
Whereas, this transformation is due to the support of
friends in the United States, from the crucial role America
played in brokering peace in Northern Ireland, culminating
with the 1998 Good Friday Agreement, to the huge American
economic investment in Ireland. There are almost one
thousand U.S. companies in Ireland, employing over two
hundred thousand people directly. Our economic relationship
is truly two-way; some one hundred thousand people are
employed in the U.S. by over 650 Irish-owned companies,
across all fifty states. Indeed, Ireland is now the ninth
largest source of foreign direct investment in the U.S.; and
Whereas, the U.S.-Irish relationship is a shining
example of how ancestral ties, historical connections,
cultural affinities, and shared values can create a
foundation for enduring partnership and mutual prosperity.
Irish American state legislators across the United States
are playing a vitally important role in fostering this
partnership and ensuring that it continues and flourishes
for another century to come:
Now, Therefore, Be It Resolved that the members of the
Missouri Senate, One Hundred and Second General Assembly,
Second Regular Session, the House of Representatives
concurring therein, hereby recognize and celebrate the
special relationship between the United States and Ireland;
and
2
Be It Further Resolved that the Secretary of the Senate
be instructed to prepare a properly inscribed copy of this
resolution for the American Irish State Legislators Caucus.
