To repeal sections 544.190 and 563.046, RSMo, and to enact in lieu thereof three new sections
relating to use of force by law enforcement officers, with penalty provisions.
Be it enacted by the General Assembly of the State of Missouri, as follows:
1 Section A. Sections 544.190 and 563.046, RSMo, are
2 repealed and three new sections enacted in lieu thereof, to be
3 known as sections 544.190, 562.059, and 563.046, to read as
4 follows:
1 544.190. [If, after notice of the intention to arrest
2 the defendant, he either flee or forcibly resist, the]
3 1. An officer [may use all necessary means] shall not
4 use deadly force to effect [the] an arrest unless:
5 (1) A person is displaying aggravated aggressive
6 resistance, thereby leading the officer to an objectively
7 reasonable belief that the person poses an imminent threat
8 of death or serious physical injury to the officer or
9 others, or to prevent escape of a person whom the officer
10 has reasonable grounds to believe committed or attempted to
11 commit a violent felony where the officer has probable cause
12 to believe that the suspect poses a threat of immediate,
13 serious physical injury either to the officer or others; and
14 (2) The officer first used less intrusive or
15 physically harmful methods to control the person and such
16 methods were ineffective or the officer reasonably
17 determines such methods would be ineffective.
EXPLANATION-Matter enclosed in bold-faced brackets [thus] in this bill is not enacted
and is intended to be omitted in the law.
SB 1151 2
18 2. (1) Officers shall receive training on
19 opportunities to employ tactical retreat, withdrawal, and
20 other de-escalation techniques to increase incident
21 resolution options and enhance officer safety; and
22 (2) Law enforcement agencies shall publicly share use
23 of force policies and report all instances of deadly force
24 to the attorney general for annual publication.
25 3. (1) Prior to using force to effect an arrest,
26 officers shall:
27 (a) Identify themselves as officers before using force
28 whenever safely possible;
29 (b) Permit individuals the opportunity to submit to
30 arrest before force is used whenever possible; and
31 (c) Communicate, when possible and appropriate, to the
32 individual and other officers that the use of the weapon is
33 imminent in order to allow the individual an opportunity to
34 comply; and
35 (2) In determining whether the use of force is
36 necessary and reasonable to effect an arrest, an officer
37 shall consider whether a person may be noncompliant due to a
38 medical or mental health condition, mental health crisis,
39 physical or hearing impairment, language barrier, or drug
40 interaction. When noncompliance appears to be due to such a
41 condition, an officer shall be trained and required to
42 employ de-escalation tactics and techniques.
43 4. Use of force to effect an arrest shall be
44 prohibited when:
45 (1) A person is restrained, such as when handcuffed or
46 contained in a police vehicle;
47 (2) A person only verbally confronts an officer;
SB 1151 3
48 (3) Used as a retaliatory force against a person by an
49 officer when use of such force is not reasonably necessary
50 to effect the arrest;
51 (4) Used to punish a person for fleeing or otherwise
52 resisting arrest;
53 (5) Used in response to an expression of criticism or
54 disrespect for an officer or any other person;
55 (6) Used against a person who may be observing or
56 recording officer behavior;
57 (7) Used to effect compliance with a command that is
58 unlawful unless:
59 (a) Necessary to prevent imminent or ongoing injury to
60 any person; or
61 (b) A person is refusing to get out of a law
62 enforcement vehicle and reasonable attempts to gain
63 voluntary compliance have failed, and a supervisor has
64 approved the use of force to remove such person.
65 5. Immediately following any arrest which required use
66 of force, an officer shall:
67 (1) Inspect the person for injury or complaints of
68 pain resulting from the use of force;
69 (2) Render medical assistance, including emergency
70 care, for any person who exhibits signs of physical
71 distress, has sustained a visible injury, expresses a
72 complaint of injury or continuing pain, or was rendered
73 unconscious, including providing first aid until
74 professional medical care providers arrive on the scene;
75 (3) Handcuff a person only when, based on the totality
76 of the circumstances, the officer reasonably believes such
77 person remains an imminent physical threat; and
SB 1151 4
78 (4) Ensure the person arrested is not restrained in a
79 manner that compromises the ability for such person to
80 breathe.
81 6. (1) If a person is killed or seriously injured by
82 an officer during an arrest, the law enforcement agency
83 shall provide the family of such person with all information
84 the agency can reasonably share regarding the incident and
85 information relating to available counseling services.
86 (2) The law enforcement agency may keep the family
87 from the seriously injured or killed person as necessary to
88 protect the integrity of the scene provided that the law
89 enforcement agency gives the family the rationale for such
90 exclusion.
91 (3) Family members shall not be restrained unless
92 necessary to protect the integrity of the scene.
1 562.059. No law enforcement officer shall be immune
2 from civil or criminal liability while on active duty or
3 under color of law for any incident that involves an act of
4 excessive use of physical or deadly force to effect an
5 arrest pursuant to sections 544.190 and 563.046.
1 563.046. 1. A law enforcement officer need not
2 retreat or desist from efforts to effect the arrest, or from
3 efforts to prevent the escape from custody, of a person he
4 or she reasonably believes to have committed an offense
5 because of resistance or threatened resistance of the
6 arrestee. In addition to the use of physical force
7 authorized under other sections of this chapter, a law
8 enforcement officer is, subject to section 544.190 and the
9 provisions of subsections 2 [and], 3, 4, and 5 of this
10 section, justified in the use of such physical force as he
11 or she reasonably believes is immediately necessary to
12 effect the arrest or to prevent the escape from custody.
SB 1151 5
13 2. The use of any physical force in making an arrest
14 is not justified under this section unless the arrest is
15 lawful or the law enforcement officer reasonably believes
16 the arrest is lawful, and the amount of physical force used
17 was objectively reasonable in light of the totality of the
18 particular facts and circumstances confronting the officer
19 on the scene, without regard to the officer's underlying
20 intent or motivation.
21 3. The use of a choke-hold in making an arrest is not
22 justified under this section.
23 4. In effecting an arrest or in preventing an escape
24 from custody, a law enforcement officer is justified in
25 using deadly force only when the law enforcement officer
26 reasonably believes, based on the totality of the
27 circumstances, that such force is necessary:
28 (1) [When deadly force is authorized under other
29 sections of this chapter] To protect the law enforcement
30 officer or another from imminent death or great bodily harm;
31 or
32 (2) [When the officer reasonably believes that such
33 use of deadly force is immediately necessary to effect the
34 arrest or prevent an escape from custody and also reasonably
35 believes that the person to be arrested:
36 (a) Has committed or attempted to commit a felony
37 offense involving the infliction or threatened infliction of
38 serious physical injury; or
39 (b) Is attempting to escape by use of a deadly weapon
40 or dangerous instrument; or
41 (c) May otherwise endanger life or inflict serious
42 physical injury to the officer or others unless arrested
43 without delay] To effect the arrest or capture of a person
44 whom the law enforcement officer knows or has reasonable
SB 1151 6
45 grounds to believe has committed or attempted to commit a
46 felony offense involving the infliction or threatened
47 infliction of serious physical injury and the officer
48 reasonably believes that the person will cause death or
49 great bodily harm to another person unless immediately
50 apprehended.
51 5. A law enforcement officer shall not use deadly
52 force against a person based on the danger the person poses
53 to the law enforcement officer if an objectively reasonable
54 law enforcement officer would believe the person does not
55 pose an imminent threat of death or great bodily harm to the
56 law enforcement officer or to another person.
57 [4.] 6. The defendant shall have the burden of
58 injecting the issue of justification under this section.
59 7. A law enforcement officer shall have the duty at
60 any scene where physical force is being applied to either
61 stop, or attempt to stop, another officer when force is
62 inappropriately applied or is no longer required.
63 8. (1) A law enforcement officer who purposefully
64 allows a fellow officer to use inappropriate or excessive
65 force, including the use of a choke-hold, may be prosecuted
66 for failure to intervene.
67 (2) Such failure to intervene shall be a class E
68 felony if it is proven the defendant officer was aware of
69 the other officer's violation and chose not to intervene.
70 9. Any law enforcement officer charged with a
71 violation of this section shall be prohibited from being
72 hired or employed by any law enforcement agency in the state.
