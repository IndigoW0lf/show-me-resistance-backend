126 is subject to a tax under a federal law imposing a tax
127 against which credit may be taken for contributions required
128 to be paid into a state unemployment compensation trust
129 fund. Nothing in this section shall be construed to prevent

35 her with the wages paid to him or her for
36 insured work during each quarter of his or her
37 base period or twenty-six times his or her
38 weekly benefit amount, whichever is the lesser.
39 In addition, if a claimant receives wages in the
40 form of termination pay or severance pay and
41 such payment appears in a base period
42 established by the filing of an initial claim,
43 the claimant may, at his or her option, choose
44 to have such payment included in the calendar
45 quarter in which it was paid or choose to have
46 it prorated equally among the quarters
47 comprising the base period of the claim. For
48 the purpose of this section, wages shall be
49 counted as wage credits for any benefit year,

54 the period commencing with the end of a prior
55 base period and ending on the date on which he
56 or she filed an allowed initial claim shall not
57 be available for benefit purposes in a

62 benefit amount or wages in an amount equal to at
63 least ten times his or her current weekly
64 benefit amount.

93 rates as published by the United States
94 Department of Labor, Bureau of Labor Statistics,
95 for the time periods of January first through

112 deceased person and no petition has been filed
113 for the probate of the will or for the
114 administration of the estate of such person
115 within thirty days after his or her death, the
116 division may by regulation provide for the
117 payment of such benefits to such person or
118 persons as the division finds entitled thereto
119 and every such payment shall be a valid payment
120 to the same extent as if made to the legal
121 representatives of the deceased.
122 7. The division is authorized to cancel
123 any benefit warrant remaining outstanding and
124 unpaid one year after the date of its issuance

132 electronic funds transfer, a claimant shall
133 satisfactorily complete a direct deposit

148 division shall prescribe. At a minimum, the
149 division shall verify the Social Security number
150 and date of birth when an individual claimant
151 initially files for unemployment insurance
152 benefits. If verification information does not
153 match what is on file in division databases to
154 what the individual is stating, the division
155 shall require the claimant to submit a division-
156 approved form requesting an affidavit of
157 eligibility prior to the payment of additional
158 future benefits. The division of employment
159 security shall cross-check unemployment
160 compensation applicants and recipients with
161 Social Security Administration data maintained
162 by the federal government at least weekly. The
163 division of employment security shall cross-

9 benefit. Such partial benefit shall be an amount equal to
SB 845 12
10 the difference between his or her weekly benefit amount and
11 that part of his or her wages for such week in excess of
12 twenty dollars, and, if such partial benefit amount is not a
13 multiple of one dollar, such amount shall be reduced to the
14 nearest lower full dollar amount. For calendar year 2007
15 and each year thereafter, such partial benefit shall be an
16 amount equal to the difference between his or her weekly
17 benefit amount and that part of his or her wages for such
18 week in excess of twenty dollars or twenty percent of his or
19 her weekly benefit amount, whichever is greater, and, if
20 such partial benefit amount is not a multiple of one dollar,
21 such amount shall be reduced to the nearest lower full
22 dollar amount. [Termination pay, severance pay, or] Pay
23 received by an eligible insured worker who is a member of
24 the organized militia for training or duty authorized by
25 Section 502(a)(1) of Title 32, United States Code, shall not
26 be considered wages for the purpose of this subsection.
27 4. The division shall compute the wage credits for
28 each individual by crediting him or her with the wages paid
29 to him or her for insured work during each quarter of his or
30 her base period or twenty-six times his or her weekly
31 benefit amount, whichever is the lesser. In addition, if a
32 claimant receives wages in the form of termination pay,
33 vacation pay, holiday pay, or severance pay and such payment
34 appears in a base period established by the filing of an
35 initial claim, the claimant may, at his or her option,
36 choose to have such payment included in the calendar quarter
37 in which it was paid or choose to have it prorated equally
38 among the quarters comprising the base period of the claim.
39 The maximum total amount of benefits payable to any insured
40 worker during any benefit year shall not exceed twenty times
41 his or her weekly benefit amount, or thirty-three and one-
SB 845 13
42 third percent of his or her wage credits, whichever is the
43 lesser. For the purpose of this section, wages shall be
44 counted as wage credits for any benefit year, only if such
45 benefit year begins subsequent to the date on which the
46 employing unit by whom such wages were paid has become an
47 employer. The wage credits of an individual earned during
48 the period commencing with the end of a prior base period
49 and ending on the date on which he or she filed an allowed
50 initial claim shall not be available for benefit purposes in
51 a subsequent benefit year unless, in addition thereto, such
52 individual has subsequently earned either wages for insured
53 work in an amount equal to at least five times his or her
54 current weekly benefit amount or wages in an amount equal to
55 at least ten times his or her current weekly benefit amount.
56 5. In the event that benefits are due a deceased
57 person and no petition has been filed for the probate of the
58 will or for the administration of the estate of such person
59 within thirty days after his or her death, the division may
60 by regulation provide for the payment of such benefits to
61 such person or persons as the division finds entitled
62 thereto and every such payment shall be a valid payment to
63 the same extent as if made to the legal representatives of
64 the deceased.
65 6. The division is authorized to cancel any benefit
66 warrant remaining outstanding and unpaid one year after the
67 date of its issuance and there shall be no liability for the
68 payment of any such benefit warrant thereafter.
69 7. The division may establish an electronic funds
70 transfer system to transfer directly to claimants' accounts
71 in financial institutions benefits payable to them pursuant
72 to this chapter. To receive benefits by electronic funds
73 transfer, a claimant shall satisfactorily complete a direct
SB 845 14
74 deposit application form authorizing the division to deposit
75 benefit payments into a designated checking or savings
76 account. Any electronic funds transfer system created

80 more than one week of benefits.

83 date of birth, and Social Security verification matches for
84 remote claims filing via the use of telephone or the
85 internet in accordance with such regulations as the division
86 shall prescribe. At a minimum, the division shall verify
87 the Social Security number and date of birth when an
88 individual claimant initially files for unemployment
89 insurance benefits. If verification information does not
90 match what is on file in division databases to what the
91 individual is stating, the division shall require the
92 claimant to submit a division-approved form requesting an
93 affidavit of eligibility prior to the payment of additional
94 future benefits. The division of employment security shall
95 cross-check unemployment compensation applicants and
96 recipients with Social Security Administration data
97 maintained by the federal government at least weekly. The
98 division of employment security shall cross-check at least
99 monthly unemployment compensation applicants and recipients
100 with department of revenue drivers license databases.
