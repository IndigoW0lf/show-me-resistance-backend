AN ACT
To amend chapter 167, RSMo, by adding thereto one new section relating to school meals.
Be it enacted by the General Assembly of the State of Missouri, as follows:
1 Section A. Chapter 167, RSMo, is amended by adding thereto
2 one new section, to be known as section 167.204, to read as
3 follows:
1 167.204. 1. This section shall be known and may be
2 cited as the "Missouri School Meals Act".
3 2. As used in this section, the term "school" shall
4 mean any school district; public school, including a charter
5 school; or private, religious, or parochial school that
6 participates in the National School Lunch Program or
7 successive program but does not participate in the USDA
8 Community Eligibility Option.
9 3. A school shall provide a free lunch to any student
10 who has been approved to receive a reduced price lunch under
11 the USDA National School Lunch Program. Subject to
12 appropriation, the state board of education shall reimburse
13 schools the difference between the total cost of each lunch
14 provided under this subsection and the federal reimbursement
15 rate for each lunch provided under this subsection.
16 4. A school shall determine which students may be
17 eligible for free or reduced price lunch through the
18 National School Lunch Program and shall provide information
SB 1154 2
19 and assistance to parents and guardians of such students for
20 purposes of filling out an application.
21 5. A school shall not publicly identify or otherwise
22 stigmatize a student who is or may be eligible for free or
23 reduced price lunch. A student's application for the
24 National School Lunch Program shall be used only for federal
25 reimbursement and for state aid calculations under chapter
26 163.
27 6. (1) There is hereby created in the state treasury
28 the "School Meals Fund", which shall consist of moneys
29 appropriated by the general assembly for the purposes of
30 implementing the provisions of this section. The state
31 treasurer shall be custodian of the fund. In accordance
32 with sections 30.170 and 30.180, the state treasurer may
33 approve disbursements. The fund shall be a dedicated fund
34 and money in the fund shall be used solely by the state
35 board of education for the purposes of reimbursing schools
36 as provided in subsection 3 of this section.
37 (2) Notwithstanding the provisions of section 33.080
38 to the contrary, any moneys remaining in the fund at the end
39 of the biennium shall not revert to the credit of the
40 general revenue fund.
41 (3) The state treasurer shall invest moneys in the
42 fund in the same manner as other funds are invested. Any
43 interest and moneys earned on such investments shall be
44 credited to the fund.
45 7. The state board of education shall promulgate rules
46 and regulations for the implementation of this section.
47 Such rules shall include the process by which schools may
48 apply for reimbursement as provided in subsection 3 of this
49 section. Any rule or portion of a rule, as that term is
50 defined in section 536.010, that is created under the
SB 1154 3
51 authority delegated in this section shall become effective
52 only if it complies with and is subject to all of the
53 provisions of chapter 536 and, if applicable, section
54 536.028. This section and chapter 536 are nonseverable and
55 if any of the powers vested with the general assembly
56 pursuant to chapter 536 to review, to delay the effective
57 date, or to disapprove and annul a rule are subsequently
58 held unconstitutional, then the grant of rulemaking
59 authority and any rule proposed or adopted after August 28,
60 2024, shall be invalid and void.
