51 giving due consideration to:
52 (1) The preservation of such state moneys;
53 (2) The benefits to the economy and welfare of the
54 people of Missouri when such state money is invested in
55 banking institutions in this state that, in turn, provide
56 additional loans and investments in the Missouri economy and
57 generate state taxes from such initial investments and the
58 loans and investments created by the banking institutions,

159 other authorized securities under Section 15, Article IV, of
160 the Missouri Constitution, or any other calculation
161 determined by the state treasurer based on current market
162 investment indicators. Banking institutions may also offer
163 a higher rate than the market rate for any time deposit
164 placed with the state treasurer in excess of the total
165 amount of state moneys set at the United States of America
166 treasury securities maturing and becoming payable closest to

174 treasurer's best judgment, believes to be the best for
175 investment of state moneys at the time and in payment
SB 815 7
176 therefor may withdraw moneys from any bank account, demand
177 or time, maintained by the treasurer without having any
178 supporting warrant of the commissioner of administration.
179 The state treasurer may bid on subscriptions for such
180 obligations in accordance with the treasurer's best
181 judgment. The state treasurer shall provide for the
182 safekeeping of all such obligations so acquired in the same
183 manner that securities pledged to secure the repayment of
184 state moneys deposited in banking institutions are kept by
185 the treasurer pursuant to law. The state treasurer may hold
186 any such obligation so acquired by the treasurer until its
187 maturity or prior thereto may sell the same outright or by
188 reverse repurchase agreement provided the state's security
189 interest in the underlying security is perfected or
190 temporarily exchange such obligation for cash or other
191 authorized securities of at least equal market value with no
192 maturity more than one year beyond the maturity of any of
193 the traded obligations, for a negotiated fee as the
194 treasurer, in the exercise of the treasurer's best judgment,
195 deems necessary or advisable for the best interest of the
196 people of the state of Missouri in the light of the
197 circumstances at the time prevailing. The state treasurer
