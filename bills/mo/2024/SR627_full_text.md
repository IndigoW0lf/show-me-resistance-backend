SENATE RESOLUTION NO. 627
Whereas, the members of the Missouri Senate believe it
is altogether fitting and proper to recognize the birth of a
child as one of life's most rewarding and miraculous
occasions; and
Whereas, it is with great pride and sincere admiration
that this legislative body pauses to acknowledge the arrival
of a very special addition to the citizenry of the great
State of Missouri: Murphy Douglas Beck; and
Whereas, Murphy Douglas Beck was welcomed into this
world on Saturday, January 20, 2024, by his proud and loving
parents, Corey and Katie Beck of St. Louis, Missouri; and
Whereas, tipping the scales at six pounds, twelve
ounces and measuring nineteen inches in length, Murphy
Douglas Beck debuted as the picture of infant health; and
Whereas, Murphy Douglas Beck is the firstborn child of
Corey and Katie Beck and the fourth grandchild of Doug and
Marilyn Beck; and
Whereas, Murphy Douglas Beck will receive a lifetime of
love, support, and encouragement from all the devoted
members of his family who have welcomed him into their
hearts as a precious gift from God:
Now, Therefore, Be It Resolved that we, the members of
the Missouri Senate join in extending a warm and hearty
welcome to and express our most heartfelt congratulations
and best wishes to his proud parents at the beginning of
their new life together; and
Be It Further Resolved that the Secretary of the Senate
be instructed to prepare a properly inscribed copy of this
resolution for presentation to Corey and Katie Beck.
