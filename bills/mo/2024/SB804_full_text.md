To repeal sections 160.522 and 161.855, RSMo, and to enact in lieu thereof two new sections
relating to accountability measures for elementary and secondary schools.
Be it enacted by the General Assembly of the State of Missouri, as follows:
1 Section A. Sections 160.522 and 161.855, RSMo, are
2 repealed and two new sections enacted in lieu thereof, to be
3 known as sections 160.522 and 161.855, to read as follows:
1 160.522. 1. The department of elementary and
2 secondary education shall produce or cause to be produced,
3 at least annually, a school accountability report card for
4 each public school district, each public school building in
5 a school district, and each charter school in the state.
6 The report card shall be designed to satisfy state and
7 federal requirements for the disclosure of statistics about
8 students, staff, finances, academic achievement, and other
9 indicators. The purpose of the report card shall be to
10 provide educational statistics and accountability
11 information for parents, taxpayers, school personnel,
12 legislators, and the print and broadcast news media in a
13 standardized, easily accessible form.
14 2. The department of elementary and secondary
15 education shall develop a standard form for the school
16 accountability report card. The information reported shall
17 include, but not be limited to, the district's most recent
18 accreditation rating, enrollment, rates of pupil attendance,
SB 804 2
19 high school dropout rate and graduation rate, the number and
20 rate of suspensions of ten days or longer and expulsions of
21 pupils, the district ratio of students to administrators and
22 students to classroom teachers, the average years of
23 experience of professional staff and advanced degrees
24 earned, student achievement as measured through the
25 assessment system developed pursuant to section 160.518,
26 student scores on the ACT, along with the percentage of
27 graduates taking the test, average teachers' and
28 administrators' salaries compared to the state averages,
29 average per-pupil current expenditures for the district as a
30 whole and by attendance center as reported to the department
31 of elementary and secondary education, the adjusted tax rate
32 of the district, assessed valuation of the district, percent
33 of the district operating budget received from state,
34 federal, and local sources, the percent of students eligible
35 for free or reduced-price lunch, data on the percent of
36 students continuing their education in postsecondary
37 programs, information about the job placement rate for
38 students who complete district vocational education
39 programs, whether the school district currently has a state-
40 approved gifted education program, and the percentage and
41 number of students who are currently being served in the
42 district's state-approved gifted education program.
43 3. The report card shall permit the disclosure of data
44 on a school-by-school basis, but the reporting shall not be
45 personally identifiable to any student or education
46 professional in the state.
47 4. The report card shall identify each school or
48 attendance center that has been identified as a priority
49 school under sections 160.720 and 161.092. The report also
50 shall identify attendance centers that have been categorized
SB 804 3
51 under federal law as needing improvement or requiring
52 specific school improvement strategies.
53 5. The report card shall not limit or discourage other
54 methods of public reporting and accountability by local
55 school districts. Districts shall provide information
56 included in the report card to parents, community members,
57 the print and broadcast news media, and legislators by
58 December first annually or as soon thereafter as the
59 information is available to the district, giving preference
60 to methods that incorporate the reporting into substantive
61 official communications such as student report cards. The
62 school district shall provide a printed copy of the district-
63 level or school-level report card to any patron upon request
64 and shall make reasonable efforts to supply businesses such
65 as, but not limited to, real estate and employment firms
66 with copies or other information about the reports so that
67 parents and businesses from outside the district who may be
68 contemplating relocation have access.
69 6. For purposes of completing and distributing the
70 annual report card as prescribed in this section, a school
71 district may include the data from a charter school located
72 within such school district, provided the local board of
73 education or special administrative board for such district
74 and the charter school reach mutual agreement for the
75 inclusion of the data from the charter schools and the terms
76 of such agreement are approved by the state board of
77 education. The charter school shall not be required to be a
78 part of the local educational agency of such school district
79 and may maintain a separate local educational agency status.
80 7. The school accountability report card shall also
81 include a clear, concise, and easily understandable
82 statement of how well the public school district, public
SB 804 4
83 school building in a school district, and charter school
84 performs in the category of student growth, as student
85 growth is described in subsection 8 of this section.
86 8. For purposes of the school accountability report
87 card, student growth shall be calculated using a methodology
88 determined by the department as follows:
89 (1) The scores of all students enrolled in a school
90 building for the current full academic year compared with
91 such students' scores on the annual statewide assessments in
92 prior years shall be used in determining the school student
93 growth grade and overall grade;
94 (2) The scores of all students enrolled in a school
95 district for the current full academic year compared with
96 such students' scores on the annual statewide assessments in
97 prior years shall be used in determining the school district
98 student growth grade and overall grade;
99 (3) The scores of all students enrolled in a charter
100 school for the current full academic year compared with such
101 students' scores on the annual statewide assessments in
102 prior years shall be used in determining the charter
103 school's student growth score; and
104 (4) A school building's, school district's, or charter
105 school's annual score for student growth may be based on a
106 multi-year average of student growth, not exceeding three
107 years.
108 9. The department of elementary and secondary
109 education shall prepare the school accountability report
110 card in a clear and easily accessible manner.
111 10. The department of elementary and secondary
112 education shall prepare a separate section of the
113 accountability report card for each elementary school and
114 high school for each school district and charter school.
SB 804 5
115 11. The department of elementary and secondary
116 education shall provide a confidential version of the school

1 161.855. 1. By October 1, 2014, the state board of
2 education shall convene work groups composed of education
3 professionals to develop and recommend academic performance
4 standards. The work groups shall be composed of individuals
5 as provided in section 160.514. The state board of
6 education and the work groups shall follow the procedures
7 and conduct the public hearings required by section
8 160.514. The state board of education shall convene
9 separate work groups for the following subject areas:
10 English language arts; mathematics; science; and history and
11 governments. For each of these four subject areas, the
12 state board of education shall convene two separate work
SB 804 6
13 groups, one work group for grades kindergarten through five
14 and another work group for grades six through twelve.
15 2. The work groups shall develop and recommend
16 academic performance standards to the state board of
17 education by October 1, 2015. The work groups shall report
18 on their progress in developing the academic performance
19 standards to the president pro tempore of the senate and the
20 speaker of the house of representatives on a monthly basis.
21 3. The state board of education shall adopt and

24 align the statewide assessment system to the academic
25 performance standards as needed.
26 4. The department of elementary and secondary
27 education shall pilot assessments from the Smarter Balanced
28 Assessment Consortium during the 2014-15 school year.
29 Notwithstanding any rules adopted by the state board of
30 education or the department of elementary and secondary
31 education in place on August 28, 2014, for the 2014-15
32 school year, and at any time the state board of education or
33 the department of elementary and secondary education
34 implements a new statewide assessment system, develops new
35 academic performance standards, or makes changes to the
36 Missouri school improvement program, the first year of such
37 statewide assessment system and performance indicators shall
38 be utilized as a pilot year for the purposes of calculating
39 a district's annual performance report under the Missouri
40 school improvement program. The results of a statewide
41 pilot shall not be used to lower a public school district's
42 accreditation or for a teacher's evaluation.
43 5. Any person performing work for a school district or
44 charter school for which teacher certification or
SB 804 7
45 administrator certification is regularly required under the
46 laws relating to the certification of teachers or
47 administrators shall be an employee of the school district
48 or charter school. All evaluations of any such person shall
49 be maintained in the teacher's or administrator's personnel
50 file and shall not be shared with any state or federal
51 agency.
52 6. Beginning with the 2026-27 school year and in all
53 subsequent school years, the annual performance rating
54 assigned to school districts and schools based on students'
55 academic performance shall be calculated using the following
56 methodology for elementary schools and school districts:
57 (1) Fifty percent of the score shall be based on the
58 year-to-year student growth, as student growth is described
59 in subsection 8 of section 160.522; and
60 (2) Fifty percent of the score shall be based on
61 overall student achievement as measured by the statewide
62 assessments and other academic measures that are indicative
63 of whether students are prepared to be promoted to the next
64 grade level.
65 7. (1) For secondary schools and school districts,
66 the department of elementary and secondary education shall
67 create a high school college and career readiness measure
68 that is based on statistical models that identify schools'
69 contributions to students' long-term outcomes separately
70 from such students' prior achievement. This model shall be
71 designed to allow for fair comparisons of schools that serve
72 different student populations. The department shall
73 determine a standard for both college readiness and career
74 readiness.
75 (2) The department shall consider the following
76 indicators when assessing college and career readiness:
SB 804 8
77 (a) Advanced Placement scores of three or higher;

81 grade of C or higher;
82 (d) Passing an industry recognized credential or
83 career and technical education certificate;
84 (e) Completion of an early college or associate degree;

88 (h) Professional internships;
89 (i) A career readiness assessment score that meets the
90 state standard determined pursuant to this subsection;
91 (j) A college readiness assessment score that meets
92 the state standard determined pursuant to this subsection;
93 (k) Confirmed postsecondary employment;
94 (l) College applications; and
95 (m) Any other postsecondary training, or other
96 department approved college and career readiness measures.
97 8. Beginning with the 2026-27 school year and in all
98 subsequent school years, the annual performance rating
99 assigned to school districts and schools based on students'
100 academic performance shall be calculated using the following
101 methodology for secondary schools and school districts:
102 (a) Sixty percent of the score shall be based on a
103 combination of the attainment of college and career
104 readiness credentials, as described in subsection 7 of this
105 section, and student growth, as student growth is described
106 in subsection 8 of section 160.522; and
107 (b) Forty percent of the score shall be based on a
108 combination of student achievement as measured by the
SB 804 9
109 state's end-of-course exams and the five-year high school
110 graduation rate.
111 9. Each school that has students who are enrolled in
112 the school for the full academic year and who are tested
113 using the statewide assessments shall receive an annual
114 performance rating pursuant to the provisions of this
115 section and an annual report card as set forth in section
116 160.522, provided that a school shall not earn an annual
117 performance rating based on students' academic performance
118 if the percent of students tested is greater than ninety-
119 five and the number of students tested is fewer than ten.
120 10. The department of elementary and secondary
121 education shall promulgate rules to implement the provisions
122 of this section, and shall additionally have the authority
123 to promulgate rules including incentives or rewards for
124 schools and school districts that receive an annual
125 performance rating of ninety percent or more or that
126 increase their score by ten percent over a three-year
127 period. Any rule or portion of a rule, as that term is
128 defined in section 536.010, that is created under the
129 authority delegated in this section shall become effective
130 only if it complies with and is subject to all of the
131 provisions of chapter 536 and, if applicable, section
132 536.028. This section and chapter 536 are nonseverable and
133 if any of the powers vested with the general assembly
134 pursuant to chapter 536 to review, to delay the effective
135 date, or to disapprove and annul a rule are subsequently
136 held unconstitutional, then the grant of rulemaking
137 authority and any rule proposed or adopted after August 28,
138 2024, shall be invalid and void.
