1 432.275. 1. As used in this section, "transferable
2 record" means an electronic record that:
3 (1) Would be a note under sections 400.3-101 to 400.3-
4 605 or a document under sections 400.7-101 to 400.7-604 if
5 the electronic record were in writing; and
SB 826 18
6 (2) The issuer of the electronic record expressly has
7 agreed is a transferable record.
8 2. A person has control of a transferable record if a
9 system employed for evidencing the transfer of interests in
10 the transferable record reliably establishes that person as
11 the person to which the transferable record was issued or
12 transferred.
13 3. A system satisfies subsection 2 of this section and
14 a person is deemed to have control of a transferable record
15 if the transferable record is created, stored, and assigned
16 in such a manner that:
17 (1) A single authoritative copy of the transferable
18 record exists which is unique, identifiable, and, except as
19 otherwise provided in subdivisions (4), (5), and (6) of this
20 subsection, unalterable;
21 (2) The authoritative copy identifies the person
22 asserting control as:
23 (a) The person to which the transferable record was
24 issued; or
25 (b) If the authoritative copy indicates that the
26 transferable record has been transferred, the person to
27 which the transferable record was most recently transferred;
28 (3) The authoritative copy is communicated to and
29 maintained by the person asserting control or its designated
30 custodian;
31 (4) Copies or revisions that add or change an
32 identified assignee of the authoritative copy can be made
33 only with the consent of the person asserting control;
34 (5) Each copy of the authoritative copy and any copy
35 of a copy is readily identifiable as a copy that is not the
36 authoritative copy; and
SB 826 19
37 (6) Any revision of the authoritative copy is readily
38 identifiable as authorized or unauthorized.
39 4. Except as otherwise agreed, a person having control
40 of a transferable record is the holder, as defined in
41 subdivision [(21)] (22) of subsection (b) of section 400.1-
42 201, of the uniform commercial code, of the transferable
43 record and has the same rights and defenses as a holder of
44 an equivalent record or writing under the uniform commercial
45 code, including, if the applicable statutory requirements
46 under section 400.3-302(a), 400.7-501, or 400.9-308 of the
47 uniform commercial code are satisfied, the rights and
48 defenses of a holder in due course, a holder to which a
49 negotiable document of title has been duly negotiated, or a
50 purchaser, respectively. Delivery, possession, and
51 endorsement are not required to obtain or exercise any of
52 the rights under this subsection.
53 5. Except as otherwise agreed, an obligor under a
54 transferable record has the same rights and defenses as an
55 equivalent obligor under equivalent records or writings
56 under the uniform commercial code.
57 6. If requested by a person against which enforcement
58 is sought, the person seeking to enforce the transferable
59 record shall provide reasonable proof that the person is in
60 control of the transferable record. Proof may include
61 access to the authoritative copy of the transferable record
62 and related business records sufficient to review the terms
63 of the transferable record and to establish the identity of
64 the person having control of the transferable record.
