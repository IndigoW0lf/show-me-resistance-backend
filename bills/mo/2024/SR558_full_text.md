SENATE RESOLUTION NO. 558
Notice is hereby given by the Senator from the Twenty-
third District of the one day notice required by rule
of intent to put a motion to adopt the following rule
change:
BE IT RESOLVED by the Senate of the One Hundred Second
General Assembly, Second Regular Session, that Senate Rule
60 be amended to read as follows:
"Rule 60. Rule 60. 1. An amendment shall not go
beyond the second degree to an original bill.
2. (a) No amendment to an appropriations bill of the
state budget shall be in order if such amendment increases
the total amount of general revenue or general revenue
equivalent, in the aggregate, appropriated in all
appropriations bills considered by the senate. Any
amendment that increases the amount of general revenue or
general revenue equivalent, in the aggregate, appropriated
in all appropriations bills shall be required to be
distributed to the senators at the same time that a separate
amendment is distributed to the senators that makes an equal
reduction in general revenue or general revenue equivalent
in the same bill or any other of the appropriations bills
still pending. If the reduction is in another bill, the
decreasing amendment shall be taken up first, and the
increasing amendment may be taken up only if the decreasing
amendment is adopted. When a pair of amendments is
submitted, the decreasing amendment shall be required to
clearly identify the corresponding increasing amendment.
(b) If a senator's decreasing amendment is adopted and
the same senator's increasing amendment is defeated, the
decreasing amendment's adoption is moot.
1
(c) The offering and adoption of an amendment
decreasing the amount of general revenue or general revenue
equivalent appropriated without a balancing increase creates
no right of another senator to offer an increasing amendment
in any amount up to the amount of the decrease effected by
the decreasing amendment, and no senator may be recognized
for the purpose of making such an amendment.
3. All amendments adopted by either house to a bill
pending and originating in the same shall be incorporated in
the bill, and the bill as perfected shall before the third
reading and final passage, be printed for the use of the
members. The printing of bills ordered to third reading and
final passage shall be under the supervision of the
Committee on Rules, Joint Rules, Resolutions and Ethics,
whose report shall set forth that they find the printed copy
of such bills as theretofore agreed and furnished for the
use of the members is correct. A correct record of each
day's proceedings in each house shall be furnished for the
use of the members of the general assembly before the record
is approved and no bill shall be signed by the presiding
officer of either house until such printed copy thereof
shall have been furnished for the use of the members of the
general assembly and the record of the previous day shall
have been approved. When agreed to by both houses, the bill
as finally passed shall be typed or printed and signed by
the presiding officer of each house and transmitted to the
governor.".
