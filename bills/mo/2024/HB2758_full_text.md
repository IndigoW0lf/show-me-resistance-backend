14 (6) "Gestational age", length of pregnancy as measured from the first day of the
15 woman's last menstrual period;
16 (7) "Medicalemergency"[,aconditionwhich,basedonreasonablemedicaljudgment,
17 so complicates the medical condition of a pregnant woman as to necessitate the immediate
18 abortion of her pregnancy to avert the death of the pregnant woman or for which a delay will
19 create a serious risk of substantial and irreversible physical impairment of a major bodily
20 function of the pregnant woman]:
21 (a) A medical condition manifesting itself by acute symptoms of sufficient
22 severity, including severe pain, such that the absence of immediate medical attention
23 could reasonably be expected to result in:
24 a. Placing the health of the individual or, with respect to a pregnant woman, the
25 health of the woman or her unborn child in serious jeopardy;
26 b. Serious impairment to bodily functions; or
27 c. Serious dysfunction of any bodily organ or part; or
28 (b) With respect to a pregnant woman who is having contractions:

47 life support systems.
188.023. Any licensed health care professional who delivers a baby or performs an
2 abortion[, who has prima facie evidence that a patient has been the victim of statutory rape in
3 the first degree or statutory rape in the second degree, or if the] on a patient who is under the

4 the unborn child, human pregnancy, and the effects of abortion was either not part of the
5 record or was not available at the time. Since 1973, advances in medical and scientific
6 technology have greatly expanded our knowledge of prenatal life and the effects of abortion
7 on women. The general assembly of this state finds:
8 (1) At conception, a new genetically distinct human being is formed;
9 (2) The fact that the life of an individual human being begins at conception has long
10 been recognized in Missouri law: "[T]he child is, in truth, alive from the moment of
11 conception". State v. Emerich, 13 Mo. App. 492, 495 (1883), affirmed, 87 Mo. 110 (1885).
12 Under section 1.205, the general assembly has recognized that the life of each human being
13 begins at conception and that unborn children have protectable interests in life, health, and
14 well-being;
15 (3) The first prohibition of abortion in Missouri was enacted in 1825. Since then, the
16 repeal and reenactment of prohibitions of abortion have made distinctions with respect to
17 penalties for performing or inducing abortion on the basis of "quickening"; however, the
18 unborn child was still protected from conception onward;
19 (4) In ruling that Missouri's prohibition on abortion was constitutional in 1972, the
20 Missouri supreme court accepted as a stipulation of the parties that "'[i]nfant Doe, Intervenor
21 Defendant in this case, and all other unborn children have all the qualities and attributes of
22 adult human persons differing only in age or maturity. Medically, human life is a continuum
23 from conception to death.'" Rodgers v. Danforth, 486 S.W.2d 258, 259 (1972);
24 (5) In Webster v. Reproductive Health Services, 492 U.S. 490 (1989), the Supreme
25 Court, while considering the "preamble" that set forth "findings" in section 1.205, stated:
26 "We think the extent to which the preamble's language might be used to interpret other state
27 statutes or regulations is something that only the courts of Missouri can definitively decide.
28 Statelawhasofferedprotectionstounbornchildrenintortandprobatelaw".Id.at506. Since
29 Webster, Missouri courts have construed section 1.205 and have consistently found that an
HB 2758 4
30 unborn child is a person for purposes of Missouri's homicide and assault laws when the
31 unbornchild'smotherwaskilledorassaultedbyanotherperson. Section1.205hasevenbeen
32 found applicable to the manslaughter of an unborn child who was eight weeks gestational age
33 or earlier. State v. Harrison, 390 S.W.3d 927 (Mo. Ct. App. 2013);
34 (6) In medicine, a special emphasis is placed on the heartbeat. The heartbeat is a
35 discernible sign of life at every stage of human existence. During the fifth week of
36 gestational age, an unborn child's heart begins to beat and blood flow begins during the sixth
37 week;
38 (7) Depending on the ultrasound equipment being used, the unborn child's heartbeat
39 canbevisuallydetectedasearlyassixtoeightweeksgestationalage. Byabouttwelveweeks
40 gestational age, the unborn child's heartbeat can consistently be made audible through the use
41 of a handheld Doppler fetal heart rate device;
42 (8) Confirmation of a pregnancy can be indicated through the detection of the unborn
43 child's heartbeat, while the absence of a heartbeat can be an indicator of the death of the
44 unborn child if the child has reached the point of development when a heartbeat should be
45 detectable;
46 (9) Heart rate monitoring during pregnancy and labor is utilized to measure the heart
47 rate and rhythm of the unborn child, at an average rate between one hundred ten and one
48 hundred sixty beats per minute, and helps determine the health of the unborn child;
49 (10) The Supreme Court in Roe discussed "the difficult question of when life begins"
50 and wrote: "[p]hysicians and their scientific colleagues have regarded [quickening] with less
51 interest and have tended to focus either upon conception, upon live birth, or upon the interim
52 point at which the fetus becomes 'viable', that is, potentially able to live outside the mother's
53 womb, albeit with artificial aid". Roe, 410 U.S. at 160. Today, however, physicians' and
54 scientists' interests on life in the womb also focus on other markers of development in the
55 unborn child, including, but not limited to, presence of a heartbeat, brain development, a
56 viable pregnancy or viable intrauterine pregnancy during the first trimester of pregnancy, and
57 the ability to experience pain;
58 (11) In Planned Parenthood of Central Missouri v. Danforth, 428 U.S. 52 (1976), the
59 Supreme Court noted that "we recognized in Roe that viability was a matter of medical
60 judgment, skill, and technical ability, and we preserved the flexibility of the term". Id. at 64.
61 Due to advances in medical technology and diagnoses, present-day physicians and scientists
62 nowdescribetheviabilityofanunbornchildinanadditionalmanner,bydeterminingwhether
63 there is a viable pregnancy or viable intrauterine pregnancy during the first trimester of
64 pregnancy;
65 (12) While the overall risk of miscarriage after clinical recognition of pregnancy is
66 twelvetofifteenpercent,theincidencedecreasessignificantlyifcardiacactivityintheunborn
HB 2758 5
67 child has been confirmed. The detection of a heartbeat in an unborn child is a reliable
68 indicator of a viable pregnancy and that the unborn child will likely survive to birth,
69 especially if presenting for a prenatal visit at eight weeks gestational age or later. For
70 asymptomaticwomenattendingafirstprenatalvisitbetweensixandelevenweeksgestational
71 age where a heartbeat was confirmed through an ultrasound, the subsequent risk of
72 miscarriageisone andsix-tenthspercent. Although the riskishigher at six weeks gestational
73 age at nine and four-tenths percent, it declines rapidly to one and five-tenths percent at eight
74 weeks gestational age, and less than one percent at nine weeks gestational age or later;
75 (13) The presence of a heartbeat in an unborn child represents a more definable point
76 ofascertaining survivability than the ambiguous conceptof viability that has been adoptedby
77 theSupremeCourt,especiallysinceifaheartbeatisdetectedateightweeksgestationalageor
78 later in a normal pregnancy, there is likely to be a viable pregnancy and there is a high
79 probability that the unborn child will survive to birth;
80 (14) The placenta begins developing during the early first trimester of pregnancy and
81 performs a respiratory function by making oxygen supply to and carbon dioxide removal
82 from the unborn child possible later in the first trimester and throughout the second and third
83 trimesters of pregnancy;
84 (15) By the fifth week of gestation, the development of the brain of the unborn child
85 is underway. Brain waves have been measured and recorded as early as the eighth week of
86 gestational age in children who were removed during an ectopic pregnancy or hysterectomy.
87 Fetal magnetic resonance imaging (MRI) of an unborn child's brain is used during the second
88 and third trimesters of pregnancy and brain activity has been observed using MRI;
89 (16)] Missouri law identifies the presence of circulation, respiration, and brain
90 function as indicia of life under section 194.005, as the presence of circulation, respiration,
91 and brain function indicates that such person is not legally dead, but is legally alive[;].
92 [(17) Unborn children at eight weeks gestational age show spontaneous movements,
93 such as a twitching of the trunk and developing limbs. It has been reported that unborn
94 children at this stage show reflex responses to touch. The perioral area is the first part of the
95 unborn child's body to respond to touch at about eight weeks gestational age and by fourteen
96 weeks gestational age most of the unborn child's body is responsive to touch;
97 (18) Peripheral cutaneous sensory receptors, the receptors that feel pain, develop
98 early in the unborn child. They appear in the perioral cutaneous area at around seven to eight
99 weeksgestationalage,in thepalmarregionsat tentoten anda halfweeksgestationalage,the
100 abdominal wall at fifteen weeks gestational age, and over all of the unborn child's body at
101 sixteen weeks gestational age;
102 (19) Substance P, a peptide that functions as a neurotransmitter, especially in the
103 transmission of pain, is present in the dorsal horn of the spinal cord of the unborn child at
HB 2758 6
104 eight to ten weeks gestational age. Enkephalins, peptides that play a role in
105 neurotransmission and pain modulation, are present in the dorsal horn at twelve to
106 fourteen weeks gestational age;
107 (20) When intrauterine needling is performed on an unborn child at sixteen weeks
108 gestational age or later, the reaction to this invasive stimulus is blood flow redistribution to
109 the brain. Increased blood flow to the brain is the same type of stress response seen in a born
110 child and an adult;
111 (21) Bysixteenweeksgestationalage,paintransmissionfromaperipheralreceptorto
112 the cortex is possible in the unborn child;
113 (22) Physicians provide anesthesia during in utero treatment of unborn children as
114 early as sixteen weeks gestational age for certain procedures, including those to correct fetal
115 urinary tract obstruction. Anesthesia is administered by ultrasound-guided injection into the
116 arm or leg of the unborn child;
117 (23) A leading textbook on prenatal development of the human brain states, "It may
118 be concluded that, although nociperception (the actual perception of pain) awaits the
119 appearanceofconsciousness,nociception(theexperienceofpain)ispresentsometimebefore
120 birth. In the absence of disproof, it is merely prudent to assume that pain can be experienced
121 even early in prenatal life (Dr. J. Wisser, ZÃ¼rich): the fetus should be given the benefit of the
122 doubt". Ronan O'Rahilly & Fabiola MÃ¼ller. The Embryonic Human Brain: An Atlas of
123 Developmental Stages (3d ed. 2005);
124 (24) By fourteen or fifteen weeks gestational age or later, the predominant abortion
125 method in Missouri is dilation and evacuation (D&E). The D&E abortion method includes
126 the dismemberment, disarticulation, and exsanguination of the unborn child, causing the
127 unborn child's death;
128 (25) The Supreme Court acknowledged in Gonzales v. Carhart, 550 U.S. 124, 160
129 (2007), that "the standard D&E is in some respects as brutal, if not more, than the intact
130 D&E" partial birth abortion method banned by Congress and upheld as facially constitutional
131 by the Supreme Court, even though the federal ban was applicable both before and after
132 viability and had no exception for the health of the mother;
133 (26) Missouri's ban on the partial birth abortion method, section 565.300, is in effect
134 because of Gonzales v. Carhart and the Supreme Court's subsequent decision in Nixon v.
135 Reproductive Health Services of Planned Parenthood of the St. Louis Region, Inc., 550 U.S.
136 901 (2007), to vacate and remand to the appellate court the prior invalidation of section
137 565.300. Since section 565.300, like Congress' ban on partial birth abortion, is applicable
138 both before and after viability, there is ample precedent for the general assembly to
139 constitutionallyprohibitthe brutalD&E abortion method at fourteenweeks gestationalage or
140 later, even before the unborn child is viable, with a medical emergency exception;
HB 2758 7
141 (27) In Roper v. Simmons, 543 U.S. 551 (2005), the Supreme Court determined that
142 "evolving standards of decency" dictated that a Missouri statute allowing the death penalty
143 for a conviction of murder in the first degree for a person under eighteen years of age when
144 the crime was committed was unconstitutional under the Eighth and Fourteenth Amendments
145 totheUnitedStatesConstitutionbecauseitviolatedtheprohibitionagainst"cruelandunusual
146 punishments";
147 (28) In Bucklew v. Precythe, 139 S. Ct. 1112, 1123 (2019), the Supreme Court noted
148 that "'[d]isgusting' practices" like disemboweling and quartering "readily qualified as 'cruel
149 and unusual', as a reader at the time of the Eighth Amendment's adoption would have
150 understood those words";
151 (29) Evolving standards of decency dictate that Missouri should prohibit the brutal
152 and painful D&E abortion method at fourteen weeks gestational age or later, with a medical
153 emergency exception, because if a comparable method of killing was used on:
154 (a) A person convicted of murder in the first degree, it would be cruel and unusual
155 punishment; or
156 (b) Ananimal,itwouldbeunlawfulunderstatelawbecauseitwouldnotbeahumane
157 method, humane euthanasia, or humane killing of certain animals under chapters 273 and
158 578;
159 (30) In Roper, the Supreme Court also found that "[i]t is proper that we acknowledge
160 the overwhelming weight of international opinion against the juvenile death penalty.... The
161 opinion of the world community, while not controlling our outcome, does provide respected
162 and significant confirmation for our own conclusions". Roper, 543 U.S. at 578. In its
163 opinion, the Supreme Court was instructed by "international covenants prohibiting the
164 juvenile death penalty", such as the International Covenant on Civil and Political Rights, 999
165 U.N.T.S. 171. Id. at 577;
166 (31)] 2. The opinion of the world community, reflected in the laws of the United
167 Nation's193-memberstatesandsixotherentities,isthatinmostcountries,mostabortionsare
168 prohibited after twelve weeks gestational age or later[;].
169 [(32) The opinion of the world community is also shared by most Americans, who
170 believe that most abortions in the second and third trimesters of pregnancy should be illegal,
171 based on polling that has remained consistent since 1996;
172 (33) Abortionproceduresperformedlaterinpregnancyhavea highermedicalriskfor
173 women. Compared to an abortion at eight weeks gestational age or earlier, the relative risk
174 increases exponentially at later gestational ages. The relative risk of death for a pregnant
175 woman who had an abortion performed or induced upon her at:
176 (a) Eleven to twelve weeks gestational age is between three and four times higher
177 than an abortion at eight weeks gestational age or earlier;
HB 2758 8
178 (b) Thirteen to fifteen weeks gestational age is almost fifteen times higher than an
179 abortion at eight weeks gestational age or earlier;
180 (c) Sixteen to twenty weeks gestational age is almost thirty times higher than an
181 abortion at eight weeks gestational age or earlier; and
182 (d) Twenty-one weeks gestational age or later is more than seventy-five times higher
183 than an abortion at eight weeks gestational age or earlier;
184 (34) In addition to the short-term risks of an abortion, studies have found that the
185 long-term physical and psychological consequences of abortion for women include, but are
186 not limited to, an increased risk of preterm birth, low birthweight babies, and placenta previa
187 insubsequentpregnancies,aswellasseriousbehavioralhealthissues. Theserisksincreaseas
188 abortions are performed or induced at later gestational ages. These consequences of an
189 abortion have a detrimental effect not only on women, their children, and their families, but
190 also on an already burdened health care system, taxpayers, and the workforce;
191 (35) A large percentage of women who have an abortion performed or induced upon
192 theminMissouri eachyearareatlessthaneightweeksgestationalage,alarge majorityareat
193 less than fourteen weeks gestational age, a larger majority are at less than eighteen weeks
194 gestational age, and an even larger majority are at less than twenty weeks gestational age. A
195 prohibitiononperformingorinducinganabortionateightweeksgestationalageorlater,with
196 a medical emergency exception, does not amount to a substantial obstacle to a large fraction
197 of women for whom the prohibition is relevant, which is pregnant women in Missouri who
198 are seeking an abortion while not experiencing a medical emergency. The burden that a
199 prohibition on performing or inducing an abortion at eight, fourteen, eighteen, or twenty
200 weeks gestational age or later, with a medical emergency exception, might impose on
201 abortion access, is outweighed by the benefits conferred upon the following:
202 (a) Women more advanced in pregnancy who are at greater risk of harm from
203 abortion;
204 (b) Unborn children at later stages of development;
205 (c) The medical profession, by preserving its integrity and fulfilling its commitment
206 to do no harm; and
207 (d) Society, by fostering respect for human life, born and unborn, at all stages of
208 development, and by lessening societal tolerance of violence against innocent human life;
209 (36) InWebster,theSupremeCourtnoted,inupholdingaMissouristatute,"thatthere
210 may be a 4-week error in estimating gestational age". Webster, 492 U.S. at 516. Thus, an
211 unborn child thought to be eight weeks gestational age might in fact be twelve weeks
212 gestational age, when an abortion poses a greater risk to the woman and the unborn child is
213 considerably more developed. An unborn child at fourteen weeks gestational age might be
214 eighteen weeks gestational age and an unborn child at eighteen weeks gestational age might

215 betwenty-twoweeksgestationalage,when anabortionposesa greaterrisktothe woman,the
216 unborn child is considerably more developed, the abortion method likely to be employed is
217 more brutal, and the risk of pain experienced by the unborn child is greater. An unborn child
218 at twenty weeks gestational age might be twenty-four weeks gestational age, when an
219 abortion poses a greater risk to the woman, the unborn child is considerably more developed,
220 the abortion method likely to be employed is more brutal, the risk of pain experienced by the
221 unborn child is greater, and the unborn child may be viable.
222 3. The state of Missouri is bound by Article VI, Clause 2 of the Constitution of the
223 UnitedStatesthat"alltreatiesmade,orwhichshallbemade,undertheauthorityoftheUnited
224 States, shall be the supreme law of the land". One such treaty is the International Covenant
225 on Civil and Political Rights, entered into force on March 23, 1976, and adopted by the
226 United States on September 8, 1992. In ratifying the Covenant, the United States declared
227 that while the provisions of Articles 1 through 27 of the Covenant are not self-executing, the
228 United States' understanding is that state governments share responsibility with the federal
229 government in implementing the Covenant.
230 4. Article 6, Paragraph 1, U.N.T.S. at 174, of the International Covenant on Civil and
231 Political Rights states, "Every human being has the inherent right to life. This right shall be
232 protectedbylaw. Nooneshallbearbitrarilydeprivedofhislife". ThestateofMissouritakes
233 seriously its obligation to comply with the Covenant and to implement this paragraph as it
234 relates to the inherent right to life of unborn human beings, protecting the rights of unborn
235 human beings by law, and ensuring that such unborn human beings are not arbitrarily
236 deprived of life. The state of Missouri hereby implements Article 6, Paragraph 1 of the
237 Covenant by the regulation of abortion in this state.
238 5. The state of Missouri has interests that include, but are not limited to:
239 (1) Protecting unborn children throughout pregnancy and preserving and promoting
240 their lives from conception to birth;
241 (2) Encouraging childbirth over abortion;
242 (3) Ensuring respect for all human life from conception to natural death;
243 (4) Safeguarding an unborn child from the serious harm of pain by an abortion
244 method that would cause the unborn child to experience pain while she or he is being killed;
245 (5) Preserving the integrity of the medical profession and regulating and restricting
246 practicesthat might cause the medical profession or society as a whole to become insensitive,
247 even disdainful, to life. This includes regulating and restricting abortion methods that are not
248 only brutal and painful, but if allowed to continue, will further coarsen society to the
249 humanity of not only unborn children, but all vulnerable and innocent human life, making it
250 increasingly difficult to protect such life;
HB 2758 10
251 (6) Ending the incongruities in state law by permitting some unborn children to be
252 killed by abortion, while requiring that unborn children be protected in nonabortion
253 circumstances through, including, but not limited to, homicide, assault, self-defense, and
254 defense of another statutes; laws guaranteeing prenatal health care, emergency care, and
255 testing; state-sponsored health insurance for unborn children; the prohibition of restraints in
256 correctional institutions to protect pregnant offenders and their unborn children; and
257 protectingtheinterests ofunborn children bythe appointmentof conservators, guardians,and
258 representatives;
259 (7) Reducing the risks of harm to pregnant women who obtain abortions later in
260 pregnancy; and
261 (8) Avoidingburdensonthehealthcaresystem,taxpayers,andtheworkforcebecause
262 of increased preterm births, low birthweight babies, compromised pregnancies, extended
263 postpartum recoveries, and behavioral health problems caused by the long-term effects of
264 abortions performed or induced later in the pregnancy.]

19 (2) If the physician determines that the gestational age of the unborn child is twenty
20 weeks or more, prior to performing or inducing an abortion upon the woman, the physician
21 shall determine if the unborn child is viable by using and exercising that degree of care, skill,
22 and proficiency commonly exercised by a skillful, careful, and prudent physician. In making
23 this determination of viability, the physician shall perform or cause to be performed such
24 medical examinations and tests as are necessary to make a finding of the gestational age,
25 weight, and lung maturity of the unborn child and shall enter such findings and determination
26 of viability in the medical record of the woman[;
27 (3) If the physician determines that the gestational age of the unborn child is twenty
28 weeks or more, and further determines that the unborn child is not viable and performs or

HB 2758 17
30 determinationsand the reasons for such determinations to the health care facility in which the

40 woman when it has been determined that the unborn child is viable, the physician shall first
41 certify in writing the medical threat posed to the life of the pregnant woman, or the medical
42 reasons that continuation of the pregnancy would cause a serious risk of substantial and
43 irreversible physical impairment of a major bodily function of the pregnant woman. Upon

64 (d) Any physician who performs or induces an abortion upon a woman when it has
65 beendeterminedthat the unbornchild isviableshall utilizethe availablemethod ortechnique
66 of abortion most likely to preserve the life or health of the unborn child. In cases where the
HB 2758 18
67 method or technique of abortion most likely to preserve the life or health of the unborn child
68 would present a greater risk to the life or health of the woman than another legally permitted
69 and available method or technique, the physician may utilize such other method or technique.
70 In all cases where the physician performs an abortion upon a viable unborn child, the
71 physician shall certify in writing the available method or techniques considered and the
72 reasons for choosing the method or technique employed.
73 (e) No physician shall perform or induce an abortion upon a woman when it has been

188.038. 1. The general assembly of this state finds that:
2 (1) Removing vestiges of any past bias or discrimination against pregnant women,
3 their partners, and their family members, including their unborn children, is an important task
4 for those in the legal, medical, social services, and human services professions;
5 (2) Ending any current bias or discrimination against pregnant women, their partners,
6 and their family members, including their unborn children, is a legitimate purpose of
7 government in order to guarantee that those who "are endowed by their Creator with certain
8 unalienable Rights" can enjoy "Life, Liberty and the pursuit of Happiness";
9 (3) The historical relationship of bias or discrimination by some family planning
10 programs and policies towards poor and minority populations, including, but not limited to,
11 the nonconsensual sterilization of mentally ill, poor, minority, and immigrant women and
12 other coercive family planning programs and policies, must be rejected;
13 (4) [Among Missouri residents, the rate of black or African-American women who
14 undergo abortions is significantly higher, about three and one-half times higher, than the rate
15 of white women who undergo abortions. Among Missouri residents, the rate of black or
16 African-American women who undergo repeat abortions is significantly higher, about one
17 and one-half times higher, than the rate of white women who undergo repeat abortions;
18 (5)] Performing or inducing an abortion because of the sex of the unborn child is
19 repugnant to the values of equality of females and males and the same opportunities for girls
20 and boys, and furthers a false mindset of female inferiority;
21 [(6)] (5) Government has a legitimate interest in preventing the abortion of unborn
22 children with Down Syndrome because it is a form of bias or disability discrimination and
23 victimizes the disabled unborn child at his or her most vulnerable stage. Eliminating unborn
24 children with Down Syndrome raises grave concerns for the lives of those who do live with
25 disabilities. It sends a message of dwindling support for their unique challenges, fosters a
26 false sense that disability is something that could have been avoidable, and is likely to
27 increase the stigma associated with disability.

10 by a licensed physician prior to discharge.
11 2. When the Food and Drug Administration label of any drug or
12 chemical used for the purpose of inducing an abortion includes any clinical
13 study in which more than one percent of those administered the drug or
14 chemical required surgical intervention after its administration, no physician
15 may prescribe or administer such drug or chemical to any patient without first
16 obtaining approval from the department of health and senior services of a
17 complication plan from the physician for administration of the drug or
18 chemical to any patient. The complication plan shall include any information
19 deemed necessary by the department to ensure the safety of any patient
20 suffering complications as a result of the administration of the drug or
21 chemical in question. No complication plan shall be required where the
22 patient is administered the drug in a medical emergency at a hospital and is
23 then treated as an inpatient at a hospital under medical monitoring by the

27 induced by drugs or chemicals have access to safe and reliable care. Any rule
28 or portion of a rule, as that term is defined in section 536.010, that is created
