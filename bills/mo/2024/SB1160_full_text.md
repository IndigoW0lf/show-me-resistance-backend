79 a municipally owned electric utility at rates that are
80 identical in electrical energy rates, rate structure, and
SB 1160 4
81 monthly charges to the contract or tariff that the customer
82 would be assigned if the customer were not an eligible
83 customer-generator [but shall not charge the customer-
84 generator any additional standby, capacity, interconnection,
85 or other fee or charge that would not otherwise be charged
86 if the customer were not an eligible customer-generator].
87 In the alternative, with energy and demand rates, rate
88 structure, and recurring monthly charges that are reasonably
89 calculated to recover that portion of the retail electric
90 supplier's fixed and demand costs that are not eliminated as
91 a result of the operation of the eligible customer-
92 generator's eligible electric energy generating unit; and
93 (3) Disclose annually the availability of the net
94 metering program to each of its customers or members with
95 the method and manner of disclosure being at the discretion
96 of the retail electric supplier.
97 4. A customer-generator's facility shall be equipped
98 with sufficient metering equipment that can measure the net
99 amount of electrical energy produced or consumed by the
100 customer-generator. If the customer-generator's existing
101 meter equipment does not meet these requirements or if it is
102 necessary for the retail electric supplier to install
103 additional distribution equipment to accommodate the
104 customer-generator's facility, the customer-generator shall
105 reimburse the retail electric supplier for the costs to
106 purchase and install the necessary additional equipment
107 including, but not limited to, necessary electric
108 distribution system upgrades. At the request of the
109 customer-generator, such costs may be initially paid for by
110 the retail electric supplier, and any amount up to the total
111 costs and a reasonable interest charge may be recovered from
112 the customer-generator over the course of up to twelve
SB 1160 5
113 billing cycles. Any subsequent meter testing, maintenance
114 or meter equipment change necessitated by the customer-
115 generator shall be paid for by the customer-generator.
116 5. Consistent with the provisions in this section, the
117 net electrical energy measurement shall be calculated in the
118 following manner:
119 (1) For a customer-generator, a retail electric
120 supplier shall measure the net electrical energy produced or
121 consumed during the billing period in accordance with normal
122 metering practices for customers in the same rate class,
123 either by employing a single, bidirectional meter that
124 measures the amount of electrical energy produced and
125 consumed, or by employing multiple meters that separately
126 measure the customer-generator's consumption and production
127 of electricity;
128 (2) If the electricity supplied by the supplier
129 exceeds the electricity generated by the customer-generator
130 during a billing period, the customer-generator shall be
131 billed for the net electricity supplied by the supplier in
132 accordance with normal practices for customers in the same
133 rate class;
134 (3) If the electricity generated by the customer-
135 generator exceeds the electricity supplied by the supplier
136 during a billing period, the customer-generator shall be
137 billed for the appropriate customer and demand charges for
138 that billing period in accordance with subsection 3 of this
139 section and shall be credited an amount at least equal to
140 the avoided fuel cost of the excess kilowatt-hours generated
141 during the billing period, with this credit applied to the
142 following billing period;
143 (4) Any credits granted by this subsection shall
144 expire without any compensation at the earlier of either
SB 1160 6
145 twelve months after their issuance or when the customer-
146 generator disconnects service or terminates the net metering
147 relationship with the supplier;
148 (5) For any rural electric cooperative under chapter
149 394, or any municipally owned utility, upon agreement of the
150 wholesale generator supplying electric energy to the retail
151 electric supplier, at the option of the retail electric
152 supplier, the credit to the customer-generator may be
153 provided by the wholesale generator.
154 6. (1) Each qualified electric energy generation unit
155 used by a customer-generator shall meet and be installed,
156 maintained, and repaired consistent with all applicable
157 safety, performance, interconnection, and reliability
158 standards established by any local code authorities, the
159 National Electrical Code, the National Electrical Safety
160 Code, the Institute of Electrical and Electronics Engineers,
161 and Underwriters Laboratories for distributed generation.
162 All qualified electric energy generation units utilizing
163 battery backup shall be installed to operate completely
164 isolated from the retail electric supplier's system
165 including, but not limited to, all neutral connections and
166 grounding points, during times of backup operation. Unless
167 allowed under subdivision (2) of subsection 3 of this
168 section, no supplier shall impose any fee, charge, or other
169 requirement not specifically authorized by this section or
170 the rules promulgated under subsection 9 of this section
171 unless the fee, charge, or other requirement would apply to
172 similarly situated customers who are not customer-
173 generators, except that a retail electric supplier may
174 require that a customer-generator's system contain adequate
175 surge protection and a switch, circuit breaker, fuse, or
176 other easily accessible device or feature located in
SB 1160 7
177 immediate proximity to the customer-generator's metering
178 equipment that would allow a utility worker or emergency
179 response personnel the ability to manually and instantly
180 disconnect the unit from the utility's electric distribution
181 system.
182 (2) For systems of ten kilowatts or less, a customer-
183 generator whose system meets the standards and rules under
184 subdivision (1) of this subsection shall not be required to
185 install additional controls, perform or pay for additional
186 tests or distribution equipment, or purchase additional
187 liability insurance beyond what is required under
188 subdivision (1) of this subsection and subsection 4 of this

219 professional electrician or engineer is not licensed, the
220 retail electric supplier may require a bond or other form of
221 surety to insure the safe installation and operation of the
222 qualified electric energy generation unit. If the
223 application for interconnection is approved by the retail
224 electric supplier and the customer-generator does not
225 complete the interconnection within one year after receipt
226 of notice of the approval, the approval shall expire and the
227 customer-generator shall be responsible for filing a new
228 application.
229 (2) Upon the change in ownership of a qualified
230 electric energy generation unit, the new customer-generator
231 shall be responsible for filing a new application under
232 subdivision (1) of this subsection.

249 metering. For systems of ten kilowatts or less, the
250 application process shall use an all-in-one document that
251 includes a simple interconnection request, simple
252 procedures, and a brief set of terms and conditions. Any
253 rule or portion of a rule, as that term is defined in
254 section 536.010, that is created under the authority
255 delegated in this section shall become effective only if it
256 complies with and is subject to all of the provisions of
257 chapter 536 and, if applicable, section 536.028. This
258 section and chapter 536 are nonseverable and if any of the
259 powers vested with the general assembly under chapter 536 to
260 review, to delay the effective date, or to disapprove and
261 annul a rule are subsequently held unconstitutional, then
262 the grant of rulemaking authority and any rule proposed or
263 adopted after August 28, 2007, shall be invalid and void.
