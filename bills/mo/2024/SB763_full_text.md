220 sections 589.400 to 589.425 has committed an offense that
221 requires registration under sections 589.400 to 589.425, or

228 (12) The office of state courts administrator shall
229 create a digital access portal of all orders of expungement
230 issued under this section. The portal shall allow users to
231 determine if an order for automated expungement has been
232 granted in an individual's name. The portal shall employ

249 or felony, not including a violation of a traffic
250 regulation, during the time period specified for the
251 underlying offense or offenses.

256 brought, the trial occurred, or the conviction was entered.
257 7. Nothing in this section precludes an individual
258 from filing a petition for expungement of records under

260 automated expungement under this section if such an
261 automated expungement has not yet occurred or cannot occur
262 pursuant to the provisions of this section.
263 8. Upon the occurrence of one of the circumstances
264 provided under subdivision (1) or (2) of this subsection, a
265 conviction that was expunged under this section shall be
