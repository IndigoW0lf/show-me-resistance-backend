Be it enacted by the General Assembly of the State of Missouri, as follows:
1 Section A. Section 168.500, RSMo, is repealed and one new
2 section enacted in lieu thereof, to be known as section 168.500,
3 to read as follows:
1 168.500. 1. For the purpose of providing career pay,
2 which shall be a salary supplement, for public school
3 teachers, which for the purpose of sections 168.500 to
4 168.515 shall include classroom teachers, librarians, school
5 counselors, whether certificated or uncertificated, special
6 education process coordinators, and certificated teachers
7 who hold positions as school psychological examiners,
8 parents as teachers educators, school psychologists, special
9 education diagnosticians and speech pathologists, and are on
10 the district salary schedule, there is hereby created and
11 established a career advancement program which shall be
12 known as the "Missouri Career Development and Teacher
13 Excellence Plan", hereinafter known as the "career plan or
14 program". Participation by local school districts in the
15 career advancement program established under this section
16 shall be voluntary. The career advancement program is a
17 matching fund program. The general assembly may make an
18 annual appropriation to the excellence in education fund
SB 1506 2
19 established under section 160.268 for the purpose of
20 providing the state's portion for the career advancement
21 program. The "Career Ladder Forward Funding Fund" is hereby
22 established in the state treasury. Beginning with fiscal
23 year 1998 and until the career ladder forward funding fund
24 is terminated pursuant to this subsection, the general
25 assembly may appropriate funds to the career ladder forward
26 funding fund. Notwithstanding the provisions of section
27 33.080 to the contrary, moneys in the fund shall not be
28 transferred to the credit of the general revenue fund at the
29 end of the biennium. All interest or other gain received
30 from investment of moneys in the fund shall be credited to
31 the fund. All funds deposited in the fund shall be
32 maintained in the fund until such time as the balance in the
33 fund at the end of the fiscal year is equal to or greater
34 than the appropriation for the career ladder program for the
35 following year, at which time all such revenues shall be
36 used to fund, in advance, the career ladder program for such
37 following year and the career ladder forward funding fund
38 shall thereafter be terminated.
39 2. The department of elementary and secondary
40 education, at the direction of the commissioner of
41 education, shall study and develop model career plans which
42 shall be made available to the local school districts.
43 These state model career plans shall:
44 (1) Contain three steps or stages of career
45 advancement;
46 (2) Contain a detailed procedure for the admission of
47 teachers to the career program;
48 (3) Contain specific criteria for career step
49 qualifications and attainment. These criteria shall clearly
50 describe the minimum number of professional responsibilities
SB 1506 3
51 required of the teacher at each stage of the plan and shall
52 include reference to classroom performance evaluations
53 performed pursuant to section 168.128. The criteria may
54 include, but shall not be limited to, teacher externships as
55 provided in section 168.025;
56 (4) Be consistent with the teacher certification
57 process recommended by the Missouri advisory council of
58 certification for educators and adopted by the department of
59 elementary and secondary education;
60 (5) Provide that public school teachers in Missouri
61 shall become eligible to apply for admission to the career
62 plans adopted under sections 168.500 to 168.515 after two
63 years of public school teaching in Missouri. All teachers
64 seeking admission to any career plan shall, as a minimum,
65 meet the requirements necessary to obtain the first
66 renewable professional certificate as provided in section
67 168.021;
68 (6) Provide procedures for appealing decisions made
69 under career plans established under sections 168.500 to
70 168.515.
71 3. School district career plans shall recognize
72 additional responsibilities and volunteer efforts by
73 teachers in formulating criteria for career ladder admission
74 and stage achievement. Such additional responsibilities and
75 volunteer efforts shall be required to occur outside of
76 compensated hours and may include, but shall not be limited
77 to:
78 (1) Serving as a coach, supervisor, or organizer for
79 any extracurricular activity for which the teacher does not
80 already receive additional compensation;
81 (2) Serving as a mentor for students, whether in a
82 formal or informal capacity;
SB 1506 4

86 learning opportunities to students; and
87 (5) Assisting students with postsecondary education
88 preparation including, but not limited to, teaching an ACT

91 assistance applications.
92 4. The commissioner of education shall cause the
93 department of elementary and secondary education to
94 establish guidelines for all career plans established under
95 this section, and criteria that must be met by any school
96 district which seeks funding for its career plan.
97 5. A participating local school district may have the
98 option of implementing a career plan developed by the
99 department of elementary and secondary education or a local
100 plan which has been developed with advice from teachers
101 employed by the district and which has met with the approval
102 of the department of elementary and secondary education. In
103 approving local career plans, the department of elementary
104 and secondary education may consider provisions in the plan
105 of the local district for recognition of teacher mobility
106 from one district to another within this state.
107 6. The career plans of local school districts shall
108 not discriminate on the basis of race, sex, religion,
109 national origin, color, creed, or age. Participation in the
110 career plan of a local school district is optional, and any
111 teacher who declines to participate shall not be penalized
112 in any way.
113 7. In order to receive funds under this section, a
114 school district which is not subject to section 162.920 must
SB 1506 5
115 have a total levy for operating purposes which is in excess
116 of the amount allowed in Section 11(b) of Article X of the
117 Missouri Constitution; and a school district which is
118 subject to section 162.920 must have a total levy for
119 operating purposes which is equal to or in excess of twenty-
120 five cents on each hundred dollars of assessed valuation.
121 8. The commissioner of education shall cause the
122 department of elementary and secondary education to regard a
123 speech pathologist who holds both a valid certificate of
124 license to teach and a certificate of clinical competence to
125 have fulfilled the standards required to be placed on stage
126 III of the career program, provided that such speech
127 pathologist has been employed by a public school in Missouri
128 for at least two years and is approved for placement at such
129 stage III by the local school district.
130 9. Beginning in fiscal year 2012, the state portion of
131 career ladder payments shall only be made available to local
132 school districts if the general assembly makes an
133 appropriation for such program. Payments authorized under
134 sections 168.500 to 168.515 shall only be made available in
135 a year for which a state appropriation is made. Any state
136 appropriation shall be made prospectively in relation to the
137 year in which work under the program is performed.
138 10. Nothing in this section shall be construed to
139 prohibit a local school district from funding the program
140 for its teachers for work performed in years for which no
141 state appropriation is made available.
