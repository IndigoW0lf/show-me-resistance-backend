JOINT RESOLUTION
Submitting to the qualified voters of Missouri, an amendment repealing sections 1, 21, 22, 23, and
39 of article III of the Constitution of Missouri, and adopting five new sections in lieu
thereof relating to the powers of the legislature.
Be it resolved by the Senate, the House of Representatives concurring therein:
1 That at the next general election to be held in the
2 state of Missouri, on Tuesday next following the first Monday
3 in November, 2024, or at a special election to be called by
4 the governor for that purpose, there is hereby submitted to
5 the qualified voters of this state, for adoption or
6 rejection, the following amendment to article III of the
7 Constitution of the state of Missouri:
1 Section A. Sections 1, 21, 22, 23, and 39, article III,
2 Constitution of Missouri, are repealed and five new sections
3 adopted in lieu thereof, to be known as sections 1, 21, 22, 23,
4 and 39, to read as follows:
1 Section 1. The legislative power shall be vested in a
2 senate and house of representatives to be styled "The
3 General Assembly of the State of Missouri[.]", subject to
4 the limitations on the abuse of that power as enumerated in
5 this constitution. Any citizen of this state shall have
6 standing to bring an action alleging violation of those
7 limitations and shall be awarded appropriate attorney's fees
8 as determined by the court if such action is successful.
EXPLANATION-Matter enclosed in bold-faced brackets [thus] in this bill is not enacted
and is intended to be omitted in the law.
SJR 80 2
1 Section 21. 1. The people of this state declare that
2 sections 21, 22, and 23 of this article are to ensure a
3 transparent, orderly legislative procedure and prevent the
4 passage of legislation that does not truly have the support
5 of a majority of their representatives by prohibiting the
6 practice of combining a number of unrelated amendments in a
7 bill. These sections also serve to defeat surprise within
8 the legislative process by prohibiting a clever legislator
9 from taking advantage of his or her unsuspecting colleagues
10 by surreptitiously inserting unrelated amendments into the
11 body of a pending bill or changing a bill's purpose midway
12 through the legislative process. And these sections are
13 intended to ensure that the people of this state and their
14 representatives are fairly apprised of the legislative
15 process and have a means by which they can hold their
16 elected representatives accountable as they make the laws
17 that affect their lives and liberty.
18 2. The style of the laws of this state shall be: "Be
19 it enacted by the General Assembly of the State of Missouri,
20 as follows." No law shall be passed except by bill, and no
21 bill shall be so amended in its passage through either house
22 as to change its original purpose.
23 3. The original purpose and subject of a bill shall be
24 established by the bill's earliest title and contents at the
25 time the bill is introduced. No substantive change to a
26 bill's earliest title shall be permitted. Changes to
27 anything other than those dealing with chapter and sectional
28 references shall be considered substantive.
29 4. Bills may originate in either house and may be
30 amended or rejected by the other. Every bill shall be read
31 by title on three different days in each house.
SJR 80 3
1 Section 22. 1. Every bill shall be referred to a
2 committee of the house in which it is pending within
3 fourteen calendar days of the introduction of the bill.
4 2. After it has been referred to a committee, [one-
5 third] a majority of the elected members of the respective
6 houses shall have power to relieve a committee of further
7 consideration of a bill and place it on the calendar [for
8 consideration] where it shall be considered by the whole
9 house within two legislative days. Each committee shall
10 keep such record of its proceedings as is required by rule
11 of the respective houses and this record and the recorded
12 vote of the members of the committee shall be filed with all
13 reports on bills.
14 3. Each house of the general assembly may provide by
15 rule for such committees of that house as it deems necessary
16 to meet to consider bills or to perform any other necessary
17 legislative function during the interim between the session
18 ending on the thirtieth day of May and the session
19 commencing on the first Wednesday after the first Monday of
20 January.
21 4. After any bill has been placed on a legislative
22 calendar, a majority of the elected members of the
23 respective houses shall, by petition, have the power to
24 order it to be considered by the whole house within the time
25 frame specified in the petition.
1 Section 23. No bill shall contain more than one
2 subject which shall be clearly expressed in [its] a title,

4 of this article and general appropriation bills, which may
5 embrace the various subjects and accounts for which moneys
6 are appropriated.
