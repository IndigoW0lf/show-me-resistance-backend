3 except for state or local public benefits that may be
SB 1373 3
4 offered under 8 U.S.C. 1621(b). Nothing in this section

13 grant, contract, or loan to such third party.
14 3. As used in this section, "public benefit" means any

16 local government; or any retirement, welfare, health,
17 disability, housing, or food assistance benefit under which

21 section 173.1110, any municipal permit, or contracts or
22 agreements between public utility providers and their
23 customers or unemployment benefits payable under chapter
24 288. The unemployment compensation program shall verify the
25 lawful presence of an alien for the purpose of determining
26 eligibility for benefits in accordance with its own
27 procedures.
28 [3.] 4. In addition to providing proof of other
29 eligibility requirements, at the time of application for any
30 state or local public benefit, an applicant who is eighteen
31 years of age or older shall provide affirmative proof that
32 the applicant is a citizen or a permanent resident of the
33 United States or is lawfully present in the United States.
34 Such affirmative proof shall include documentary evidence
35 recognized by the department of revenue when processing an
SB 1373 4
36 application for a driver's license, a Missouri driver's
37 license, as well as any document issued by the federal
38 government that confirms an alien's lawful presence in the
39 United States. In processing applications for public
40 benefits, an employee of an agency of state or local
41 government shall not inquire about the legal status of a
42 custodial parent or guardian applying for a public benefit
43 on behalf of his or her dependent child who is a citizen or
44 permanent resident of the United States.
45 [4.] 5. An applicant who cannot provide the proof
46 required under this section at the time of application may
47 alternatively sign an affidavit under oath, attesting to
48 either United States citizenship or classification by the
49 United States as an alien lawfully admitted for permanent
50 residence, in order to receive temporary benefits or a
51 temporary identification document as provided in this
52 section. The affidavit shall be on or consistent with forms
53 prepared by the state or local government agency
54 administering the state or local public benefits and shall
55 include the applicant's Social Security number or any
56 applicable federal identification number and an explanation
57 of the penalties under state law for obtaining public

62 (1) For ninety days or until such time that it is
63 determined that the applicant is not lawfully present in the
64 United States, whichever is earlier; or
65 (2) Indefinitely if the applicant provides a copy of a
66 completed application for a birth certificate that is
67 pending in Missouri or some other state. An extension
SB 1373 5
68 granted under this subsection shall terminate upon the
69 applicant's receipt of a birth certificate or a
70 determination that a birth certificate does not exist
71 because the applicant is not a United States citizen.
72 [6.] 7. An applicant who is an alien shall not receive
73 any state or local public benefit unless the alien's lawful
74 presence in the United States is first verified by the
75 federal government. State and local agencies administering
76 public benefits in this state shall cooperate with the
77 United States Department of Homeland Security in achieving
78 verification of an alien's lawful presence in the United
79 States in furtherance of this section. The system utilized
80 may include the Systematic Alien Verification for
81 Entitlements Program operated by the United States
82 Department of Homeland Security. After an applicant's
83 lawful presence in the United States has been verified
84 through the Systematic Alien Verification for Entitlements
85 Program, no additional verification is required within the
86 same agency of the state or local government.
87 [7.] 8. The provisions of this section shall not be
88 construed to require any nonprofit organization duly
89 registered with the Internal Revenue Service to enforce the
90 provisions of this section, nor does it prohibit such an
91 organization from providing aid.
92 [8.] 9. Any agency that administers public benefits
93 shall provide assistance in obtaining appropriate
94 documentation to persons applying for public benefits who
95 sign the affidavit required by subsection 4 of this section
96 stating they are eligible for such benefits but lack the
97 documents required under subsection 3 of this section.

10 state, the business entity shall, by sworn affidavit and
11 provision of documentation, affirm its enrollment and
12 participation in a federal work authorization program with
13 respect to the employees working in connection with the
14 contracted services. Every such business entity shall also
15 sign an affidavit affirming that it does not knowingly
16 employ any person who is an unauthorized alien in connection
17 with the contracted services. Any entity contracting with
18 the state or any political subdivision of the state shall
19 only be required to provide the affidavits required in this

21 state with which it contracts, on an annual basis. During
22 or immediately after an emergency, the requirements of this

44 shall not be liable under sections 285.525 to 285.550 when
45 such general contractor or subcontractor contracts with its
46 direct subcontractor who violates subsection 1 of this
47 section, if the contract binding the contractor and
48 subcontractor affirmatively states that the direct
49 subcontractor is not knowingly in violation of subsection 1
50 of this section and shall not henceforth be in such
51 violation and the contractor or subcontractor receives a
52 sworn affidavit under the penalty of perjury attesting to
