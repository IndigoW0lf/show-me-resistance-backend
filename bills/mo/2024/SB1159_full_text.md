AN ACT
To repeal section 393.135, RSMo, and to enact in lieu thereof two new sections relating to
renewable energy.
Be it enacted by the General Assembly of the State of Missouri, as follows:
1 Section A. Section 393.135, RSMo, is repealed and two new
2 sections enacted in lieu thereof, to be known as sections
3 393.135 and 393.1250, to read as follows:
1 393.135. Except as provided in section 393.1250, any
2 charge made or demanded by an electrical corporation for
3 service, or in connection therewith, which is based on the
4 costs of construction work in progress upon any existing or
5 new [facility of the] electrical corporation facility, or
6 any other cost associated with owning, operating,
7 maintaining, or financing any property before it is fully
8 operational and used for service, [is unjust and
9 unreasonable, and] is prohibited.
1 393.1250. 1. This section shall be known and may be
2 cited as the "Missouri Nuclear Clean Power Act", the purpose
3 of which is to enable the construction of clean baseload
4 electric generating plants. This section shall not apply to
5 clean baseload electric generating plants that are in
6 commercial operation before August 28, 2024.
7 2. As used in this section, the following terms mean:
8 (1) "Clean baseload generating plant", a new nuclear-
9 fueled electric generating facility located in this state
EXPLANATION-Matter enclosed in bold-faced brackets [thus] in this bill is not enacted

SB 1159 2
10 that is designed to be operated at three hundred megawatts
11 or less and is intended in whole or in part to serve retail
12 customers of an electrical corporation in Missouri;
13 (2) "Construction work in progress", the electrical
14 corporation's share of all capital costs associated with a
15 clean baseload generating plant, which have been incurred
16 but have not been included in the electrical corporation's
17 plant in service, and are recorded in the Federal Energy
18 Regulatory Commission's Uniform System of Accounts
19 Prescribed for Public Utilities and Licensees Subject to the
20 Provisions of the Federal Power Act, Balance Sheet Chart
21 Accounts, as construction work in progress for electric
22 plants in 18 CFR Part 101, or any other account established
23 in the Uniform System of Accounts for the recording of
24 construction work in progress.
25 3. The provisions of section 393.135 shall not apply
26 to a clean baseload generating plant if the plant is rated
27 at three hundred megawatts or less. Before any such
28 construction work begins, an electrical corporation seeking
29 to include construction work in progress in rates shall file
30 with the commission a plan detailing the projected costs of
31 the project and the plan to recover those costs through
32 rates. Costs recovered by an electrical corporation under
33 the provisions of this section are subject to inclusion or
34 exclusion from rates in a ratemaking proceeding pursuant to
35 the commission's authority to determine just and reasonable
36 rates. If the commission determines a project was not
37 completed within a reasonable amount of time, the commission
38 shall reduce rates in an amount equal to all amounts
39 recovered in advance by the electrical corporation from
40 ratepayers under the provisions of this section plus
41 interest at the same rate as the rate of interest for
SB 1159 3
42 delinquent taxes determined by the director of revenue in
43 accordance with section 32.065, in the next ratemaking
44 proceeding for that electrical corporation.
45 4. The commission may promulgate rules to assist in
46 the implementation of this section. Any rule or portion of
47 a rule, as that term is defined in section 536.010, that is
48 created under the authority delegated in this section shall
49 become effective only if it complies with and is subject to
50 all of the provisions of chapter 536 and, if applicable,
51 section 536.028. This section and chapter 536 are
52 nonseverable and if any of the powers vested with the
53 general assembly pursuant to chapter 536 to review, to delay
54 the effective date, or to disapprove and annul a rule are
55 subsequently held unconstitutional, then the grant of
56 rulemaking authority and any rule proposed or adopted after
57 August 28, 2024, shall be invalid and void.
