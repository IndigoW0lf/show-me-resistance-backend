penalty provisions.
Be it enacted by the General Assembly of the state of Missouri, as follows:
Section A. Chapter 115, RSMo, is amended by adding thereto four new sections, to
2 be known as sections 115.1060, 115.1065, 115.1070, and 115.1075, to read as follows:
115.1060. 1. As used in this section, the following terms shall mean:
2 (1) "Federal voting rights act", the federal Voting Rights Act of 1965, 52 U.S.C.
3 Section 10301, as amended;
4 (2) "Protected class", a class of eligible voters who are members of a race,
5 ethnicity, or language-minority group;
6 (3) "Racially polarized voting", voting in which there is a difference in the
7 candidate or electoral choice preferred by a protected class and the candidate or
8 electoral choice preferred by the rest of the electorate.
9 2. No voting qualification, prerequisite to voting, law, ordinance, standard,
10 practice, procedure, regulation, or policy shall be enacted or implemented by any local
11 election authority in a manner that results in a denial or abridgment of the right of any
12 member of a protected class to vote.
13 (1) A violation of this subsection shall be established if, based on the totality of
14 the circumstances, members of a protected class have less opportunity than other
15 members of the electorate to participate in the political process or elect candidates or
16 electoral choices preferred by members of the protected class.
EXPLANATION â€” Matter enclosed in bold-faced brackets [thus] in the above bill is not enacted and is
intended to be omitted from the law. Matter in bold-face type in the above bill is proposed language.
HB 2873 2
17 (2) If assessing a potential violation of this section, the court may consider, but is
18 not limited to considering, the extent to which members of a protected class have been
19 electedtoofficeinthestateorpoliticalsubdivisionandtheextenttowhichmembersofa
20 protected class in the state or political subdivision vote at lower rates than other
21 members of the electorate.
22 (3) There shall be a presumption of denial or abridgment of the right to vote if a
23 political subdivision election is held on a date that is not concurrent with any election
24 date provided for under section 115.123 for the state or county and where, for three
25 consecutive general elections in which there is at least one contested race for an office,
26 the number of actual voters in each contested election is less than twenty-five percent of
27 the total number of votes cast in the most recent general election for President of the
28 United States by voters in the political subdivision, or in which, for any protected class
29 consisting of at least twenty-five thousand citizens of voting age or whose members
30 comprise at least ten percent of the citizen voting-age population, the percent of
31 members of that protected class who are actual voters is at least twenty-five percent
32 lower than the percent of citizens of voting age who are not members of that protected
33 class who are actual voters.
34 3. Any method of election or voting used in this state shall not have the effect of
35 impairing the ability of members of a protected class to elect candidates of their choice
36 or influence the outcome of elections as a result of the dilution or the abridgment of the
37 rights of members of the protected class.
38 (1) A violation of this subsection shall be:
39 (a) Established if it is shown that candidates or electoral choices preferred by
40 members of the protected class would usually be defeated and either the voting patterns
41 of members of the protected class within the political subdivision are racially polarized
42 or, under the totality of the circumstances, the ability of members of the protected class
43 to elect candidates of their choice or influence the election is impaired; and
44 (b) Presumptively established if it is shown that the political subdivision used
45 race, ethnicity, or language-minority group or another characteristic that serves as a
46 proxy for race, ethnicity, or language-minority group for the purpose of apportionment.
47 A political subdivision shall rebut this presumption only by showing that race, ethnicity,
48 language-minority, or another characteristic was used to the extent necessary to comply
49 with this section, the federal Voting Rights Act, or the Constitution of the United States.
50 (2) Inassessingwhethervotingpatternsofmembersoftheprotectedclasswithin

56 political subdivision shall be more probative than evidence concerning other elections;
57 (c) Statistical evidence shall be more probative than nonstatistical evidence;
58 (d) If there is evidence that more than one protected class of eligible voters are
59 politically cohesive in the political subdivision, members of each of those protected
60 classes may be combined;
61 (e) Evidence concerning the intent on the part of the voters, elected officials, or
62 the political subdivision to discriminate against a protected class shall not be required;
63 (f) Evidence that voting patterns and election outcomes could be explained by
64 factors other than racially polarized voting including, but not limited to, partisanship,
65 shall not be considered;
66 (g) Evidence that subgroups within a protected class have different voting
67 patterns shall not be considered;
68 (h) Evidence concerning whether members of a protected class are
69 geographically compact or concentrated shall not be considered, but may be a factor
70 in determining an appropriate remedy; and
71 (i) Evidence concerning projected changes in population or demographics shall
72 not be considered, but may be a factor in determining an appropriate remedy.
73 (3) In assessing whether, under the totality of the circumstances, the ability of
74 members of the protected class to elect candidates of their choice or influence the
75 outcomeofelectionsisimpaired,factorsthatmaybeconsideredshallinclude,butnotbe

91 (g) The extent to which members of the protected class are disadvantaged in
92 other areas that may hinder their ability to participate effectively in the political
93 process;
94 (h) The use of overt or subtle racial appeals in political campaigns;
95 (i) A significant lack of responsiveness on the part of elected officials to the
96 particular needs of members of the protected class; and
97 (j) Whether the political subdivision has a compelling policy justification for
98 adopting or maintaining the method of election.
99
100 None of the factors in paragraphs (a) to (j) of this subdivision shall be dispositive or
101 necessary to establish the existence of racially polarized voting. Evidence of these
102 factors concerning the state, private actors, or other political subdivisions in the
103 geographic region may be considered but is less probative than evidence concerning the
104 political subdivision itself.
105 4. Any aggrieved person, organization whose membership includes or is likely to
106 include aggrieved persons, organization whose mission would be frustrated by a
107 violation of this section, organization that would expend resources in order to fulfill its

130 minority groups to participate in the political process and elect their preferred
131 candidates to office. The court shall consider proposed remedies by any parties and
132 interested nonparties and shall not provide deference or priority to a proposed remedy
133 because it is proposed by the political subdivision. The court may implement remedies
134 notwithstanding any other provision of law.
