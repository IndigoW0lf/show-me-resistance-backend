36 2. Subject to the procedural requirements and
37 conditions set out in this chapter, the following uses are
38 exempt from the tax imposed by section 142.803 on motor
39 fuel, and a deduction or a refund may be claimed:
40 (1) (a) Motor fuel for which proof of export is
41 available in the form of a terminal-issued destination state
42 shipping paper and which is either:
43 [(a)] a. Exported by a supplier who is licensed in the
44 destination state or through the bulk transfer system;
45 [(b)] b. Removed by a licensed distributor for
46 immediate export to a state for which all the applicable
47 taxes and fees (however nominated in that state) of the
48 destination state have been paid to the supplier, as a
49 trustee, who is licensed to remit tax to the destination
SB 1027 3
50 state; or which is destined for use within the destination
51 state by the federal government for which an exemption has
52 been made available by the destination state subject to
53 procedural rules and regulations promulgated by the
54 director; or
55 [(c)] c. Acquired by a licensed distributor and which
56 the tax imposed by this chapter has previously been paid or
57 accrued either as a result of being stored outside of the
58 bulk transfer system immediately prior to loading or as a
59 diversion across state boundaries properly reported in
60 conformity with this chapter and was subsequently exported
61 from this state on behalf of the distributor[;].
62 (b) The exemption pursuant to subparagraph a. of
63 paragraph (a) of this subdivision shall be claimed by a
64 deduction on the report of the supplier which is otherwise
65 responsible for remitting the tax upon removal of the
66 product from a terminal or refinery in this state.
67 (c) The [exemption] exemptions pursuant to [paragraphs
68 (b) and (c)] subparagraphs b. and c. of paragraph (a) of
69 this subdivision shall be claimed by the distributor, upon a
70 refund application made to the director within three years.
71 (d) A refund claim may be made monthly or whenever the
72 claim exceeds one thousand dollars;
73 (2) Undyed K-1 kerosene sold at retail through
74 dispensers which have been designed and constructed to
75 prevent delivery directly from the dispenser into a vehicle
76 fuel supply tank, and undyed K-1 kerosene sold at retail
77 through nonbarricaded dispensers in quantities of not more
78 than twenty-one gallons for use other than for highway
79 purposes. Exempt use of undyed kerosene shall be governed
80 by rules and regulations of the director. If no rules or
81 regulations are promulgated by the director, then the exempt
SB 1027 4
82 use of undyed kerosene shall be governed by rules and
83 regulations of the Internal Revenue Service. A distributor
84 or supplier delivering to a retail facility shall obtain an

91 in good faith, such supplier shall be relieved of any
92 responsibility if the fuel is later used in a taxable
93 manner. An ultimate vendor who obtained undyed kerosene
94 upon which the tax levied by section 142.803 had been paid
95 and makes sales qualifying pursuant to this subsection may
96 apply for a refund of the tax pursuant to application, as
97 provided in section 142.818, to the director provided the
98 ultimate vendor did not charge such tax to the consumer;

104 this state when leased or owned and when being operated by a
105 federally recognized Indian tribe in the performance of
106 essential governmental functions, such as providing police,
107 fire, health or water services. The exemption for use
108 pursuant to this subdivision shall be made available to the
109 tribal government upon a refund application stating that the
110 motor fuel was purchased for the exclusive use of the tribe
111 in performing named essential governmental services;
112 (5) That portion of motor fuel used to operate
113 equipment attached to a motor vehicle, if the motor fuel was
SB 1027 5
114 placed into the fuel supply tank of a motor vehicle that has
115 a common fuel reservoir for travel on a highway and for the
116 operation of equipment, or if the motor fuel was placed in a
117 separate fuel tank and used only for the operation of
118 auxiliary equipment. The exemption for use pursuant to this
119 subdivision shall be claimed by a refund claim filed by the
120 consumer who shall provide evidence of an allocation of use
121 satisfactory to the director;
122 (6) Motor fuel acquired by a consumer out-of-state and

127 was lost or destroyed as a direct result of a sudden and
128 unexpected casualty or which had been accidentally

131 exemption pursuant to this subdivision shall be refunded to
132 the person or entity owning the motor fuel at the time of
133 the contamination or loss. Such person shall notify the
134 director in writing of such event and the amount of motor
135 fuel lost or contaminated within ten days from the date of
136 discovery of such loss or contamination, and within thirty
137 days after such notice, shall file an affidavit sworn to by
138 the person having immediate custody of such motor fuel at
139 the time of the loss or contamination, setting forth in full
140 the circumstances and the amount of the loss or
141 contamination and such other information with respect
142 thereto as the director may require;
143 (8) Dyed diesel fuel or dyed kerosene used for an
144 exempt purpose. This exemption shall be claimed as follows:
SB 1027 6
145 (a) A supplier or importer shall take a deduction
146 against motor fuel tax owed on their monthly report for
147 those gallons of dyed diesel fuel or dyed kerosene imported
148 or removed from a terminal or refinery destined for delivery
149 to a point in this state as shown on the shipping papers;
150 (b) This exemption shall be claimed by a deduction on
151 the report of the supplier which is otherwise responsible
152 for remitting the tax on removal of the product from a

160 as such term is defined in section 306.010, and not
161 accessible to other motor vehicles, is exempt from the fuel
162 tax imposed by this chapter. Any motor fuel distributor
163 that delivers motor fuel to any marina in this state for use
164 solely in any watercraft, as such term is defined in section
165 306.010, may claim the exemption provided in this
166 subsection. Any motor fuel customer who purchases motor
167 fuel for use in any watercraft, as such term is defined in
168 section 306.010, at a location other than a marina within
169 this state may claim the exemption provided in this
170 subsection by filing a claim for refund of the fuel tax.

7 vehicles on highways shall be exempt from the fuel tax
8 collected under subsection 3 of section 142.803, and an
9 exemption and refund may be claimed by the taxpayer if the

158 together with invoices, original sales receipts marked paid
159 by the seller, bills of lading, and other pertinent records
160 and paper as may be required by the director for reasonable

179 section shall be available only with regard to motor fuel
180 delivered into a motor vehicle with a gross weight, as

183 (2) The exemption and refund specified in this

185 delivered into a motor vehicle with a gross weight that
186 exceeds twenty-six thousand pounds when the motor vehicle is
187 owned by a corporation licensed in Missouri with its primary
188 headquarters in Missouri, or owned by a sole proprietor
189 whose home office is located in Missouri, provided that the
190 corporation or sole proprietor submits documentation to the
191 director that any exemption and refund claimed is based
192 solely on fuel delivered into a motor vehicle while it was
193 operating in the state of Missouri. If the motor vehicle
194 was operated in multiple states, the applicant shall submit
195 documentation that separates the fuel delivered to the
196 vehicle while operating in other states from the fuel
197 delivered to the vehicle while operating in the state of
198 Missouri.
199 10. The department of revenue shall develop a mobile
200 application that allows claims to be submitted on a person's
201 phone at the time of motor fuel purchase in lieu of the
202 procedures set out under subsection 2 of this section. The
203 application shall be designed so that the person submitting
204 the claim is required to demonstrate that he or she is at
205 the motor fuel pump. The development and maintenance of the

212 delegated in this section shall become effective only if it
213 complies with and is subject to all of the provisions of
214 chapter 536 and, if applicable, section 536.028. This
215 section and chapter 536 are nonseverable and if any of the
216 powers vested with the general assembly pursuant to chapter
217 536 to review, to delay the effective date, or to disapprove
218 and annul a rule are subsequently held unconstitutional,
219 then the grant of rulemaking authority and any rule proposed
220 or adopted after August 28, 2021, shall be invalid and void.
1 142.824. 1. To claim a refund in accordance with
2 section 142.815, a person shall present to the director a
3 statement containing a written verification that the claim
4 is made under penalties of perjury and lists the total
5 amount of motor fuel purchased and used for exempt
6 purposes. Beginning on October 1, 2024, any nonprofit
7 entity to which a person who is eligible to claim a refund
8 as provided in this section submits all documentation and
9 information required to make a refund application may make a
10 claim for such person's refund as provided in this section.
11 Upon approval, the refund shall be made to such nonprofit
12 entity. The claim shall [not be transferred or assigned and
13 shall] be filed not more than three years after the date the
14 motor fuel was imported, removed or sold if the claimant is
15 a supplier, importer, exporter or distributor. If the claim
16 is filed by the ultimate consumer, a consumer must file the
17 claim within one year of the date of purchase or April
SB 1027 15
18 fifteenth following the year of purchase, whichever is
19 later. The claim statement may be submitted electronically,
20 and shall be supported by documentation as approved by the
21 director and shall include the following information:
22 (1) Date of sale;
23 (2) Name and address of purchaser;
24 (3) [Name and address of seller;
25 (4)] Number of gallons purchased and base price per
26 gallon;
27 [(5)] (4) Number of gallons purchased and charged
28 Missouri fuel tax, as a separate item; [and
29 (6)] (5) Number of gallons purchased and charged sales
30 tax, if applicable, as a separate item; and

32 (a) Documentation of the nonprofit entity's tax-exempt
33 status; and
34 (b) A statement signed by the purchaser indicating
35 that the nonprofit entity is entitled to the purchaser's
36 refund.
37 2. If the original sales slip or invoice is lost or
38 destroyed, a statement to that effect shall accompany the
39 claim for refund, and the claim statement shall also set
40 forth the serial number of the invoice. If the director
41 finds the claim is otherwise regular, the director may allow
42 such claim for refund.
43 3. The director may make any investigation necessary
44 before refunding the motor fuel tax to a person and may
45 investigate a refund after the refund has been issued and
46 within the time frame for making adjustments to the tax
47 pursuant to this chapter.
48 4. In any case where a refund would be payable to a
49 supplier pursuant to this chapter, the supplier may claim a
SB 1027 16
50 credit in lieu of such refund for a period not to exceed
51 three years.
52 5. Every person shall maintain and keep for a period
53 of three years records to substantiate all claims for refund
54 of the motor fuel tax, together with invoices, original
55 sales slips marked paid by the seller, bills of lading, and
56 other pertinent records and paper as may be required by the
57 director for reasonable administration of this chapter. The
