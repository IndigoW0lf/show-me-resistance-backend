1 115.105. 1. The chair of the county committee of each
2 political party named on the ballot shall have the right to
3 designate a challenger for each polling place, who may be
4 present until all ballots are cast on the day of election,
5 and a challenger for each location at which absentee ballots
6 are counted, who may be present while the ballots are being
7 prepared for counting and counted. No later than four
8 business days before the election, the chair of each county
9 committee of each political party named on the ballot shall
10 provide signed official designation forms with the names of
11 the designated challengers and substitutes to the local
12 election authority for confirmation of eligibility to serve
13 as a challenger. The local election authority, after
14 verifying the eligibility of each designated and substitute
EXPLANATION-Matter enclosed in bold-faced brackets [thus] in this bill is not enacted
and is intended to be omitted in the law.
SB 1120 2
15 challenger, shall sign off on the official designation
16 forms, unless the challenger is found not to have the
17 qualifications established by subsection 4 of this section.
18 If the election authority determines that a challenger does
19 not meet the qualifications of subsection 4 of this section,
20 the designating party chair may designate a replacement
21 challenger and provide the local election authority with the
22 name of the replacement challenger before 5:00 p.m. of the
23 Monday preceding the election. The designating chair may
24 substitute challengers at his or her discretion during such
25 hours.
26 2. Challenges may only be made when the challenger

30 if not satisfied with the decision of the election judges.
31 3. Prior to the close of the polls, challengers may
32 list and give out the names of those who have voted. The
33 listing and giving out of names of those who have voted by a
34 challenger shall not be considered giving information
35 tending to show the state of the count.
36 4. In a presidential primary election, challengers may
37 collect information about the party ballot selected by the
38 voter and may disclose party affiliation information after
39 the polls close.
40 5. All persons selected as challengers shall have the
41 same qualifications required by section 115.085 for election
42 judges, except that such challenger shall be a registered

45 [5.] 6. Any challenge by a challenger to a voter's
46 identification for validity shall be made only to the
SB 1120 3
47 election judges or other election authority. If the poll
48 challenger is not satisfied with the decision of the
49 election judges, then he or she may report his or her belief
50 that the election laws of this state have been or will be
51 violated to the election authority as allowed under this

13 this section to the contrary, an election for a presidential
14 primary held under sections 115.755 to 115.785 shall be held
15 on the first Tuesday in March of each presidential election
