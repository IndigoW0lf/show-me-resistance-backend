To repeal sections 67.547 and 67.582, RSMo, and to enact in lieu thereof two new sections relating
to sales taxes.
Be it enacted by the General Assembly of the State of Missouri, as follows:
1 Section A. Sections 67.547 and 67.582, RSMo, are repealed
2 and two new sections enacted in lieu thereof, to be known as

4 additional county sales tax on all sales which are subject
5 to taxation under the provisions of sections 144.010 to
6 144.525. The tax authorized by this section shall be in
7 addition to any and all other sales tax allowed by law;
8 except that no ordinance or order imposing a sales tax under

10 governing body of the county submits to the voters of the
11 county, at a county or state general, primary or special
12 election, a proposal to authorize the governing body of the
13 county to impose such tax.

22 in the box opposite "YES". If you are opposed to
23 the question, place an "X" in the box opposite
24 "NO".
25 If a majority of the votes cast on the proposal by the
26 qualified voters voting thereon are in favor of the
27 proposal, then the ordinance or order and any amendments
28 thereto shall be in effect. If a majority of the votes cast
29 by the qualified voters voting are opposed to the proposal,
30 then the governing body of the county shall have no power to
31 impose the sales tax as herein authorized unless and until
32 the governing body of the county submits another proposal to
33 authorize the governing body of the county to impose the
34 sales tax under the provisions of this section and such
35 proposal is approved by a majority of the qualified voters
36 voting thereon. A county shall not submit to the voters a
37 proposed sales tax under this section for a period of two
38 years from the date of an election in which the county
39 previously submitted to the voters a proposed sales tax
40 under this section, regardless of whether the initial
41 proposed sales tax was approved or disapproved by the
42 voters. The revenue collected from the sales tax authorized
43 under this section shall only be used for the purpose
44 approved by voters of the county.
45 3. The sales tax may be imposed at a rate of one-
46 eighth of one percent, one-fourth of one percent, three-
47 eighths of one percent, or one-half of one percent on the
48 receipts from the sale at retail of all tangible personal
SB 1091 3
49 property or taxable services at retail within any county
50 adopting such tax if such property and services are subject
51 to taxation by the state of Missouri under the provisions of
52 sections 144.010 to 144.525. In any city not within a
53 county or any county described in subsection 5 of this
54 section, no sales tax for the purpose of funding zoological
55 activities and zoological facilities as those terms are
56 defined in section 184.500 shall exceed a rate of one-eighth
57 of one percent unless the sales tax was levied and collected
58 before August 28, 2017. Beginning [August 28, 2017]
59 November 1, 2022, no county shall submit to the voters any
60 proposal that results in a combined rate of sales taxes
61 adopted under this section in excess of one and one-half
62 percent. All sales tax elections conducted during the
63 November 8, 2022, general election shall be deemed in
64 compliance with state law if the aggregate sales tax rate
65 under this section is not in excess of one and one-half
66 percent.
67 4. Except as modified in this section, all provisions
68 of sections 32.085 and 32.087 shall apply to the tax imposed
69 under this section.
70 5. In any first class county having a charter form of
71 government and having a population of nine hundred thousand
72 or more, the proceeds of the sales tax authorized by this
73 section shall be distributed so that an amount equal to
74 three-eighths of the proceeds of the tax shall be
75 distributed to the county and the remaining five-eighths
76 shall be distributed to the cities, towns and villages and
77 the unincorporated area of the county on the ratio that the
78 population of each bears to the total population of the
79 county. Three-eighths of the tax rate adopted by such a
80 county shall be included in the calculation of the county's
SB 1091 4
81 one and one-half percent combined tax rate ceiling provided
82 in subsection 3 of this section. The population of each
83 city, town or village and the unincorporated area of the
84 county and the total population of the county shall be
85 determined on the basis of the most recent federal decennial
86 census. The provisions of this subsection shall not apply
87 if the revenue collected is used to support zoological
88 activities of the zoological subdistrict as defined under
89 section 184.352.
90 6. Except as prohibited under section 184.353,
91 residents of any county that does not adopt a sales tax
92 under this section for the purpose of supporting zoological
93 activities may be charged an admission fee for zoological
94 facilities, programs, or events that are not part of the
95 zoological subdistrict defined under subdivision (15) of
96 section 184.352 as of August 28, 2017.
97 7. In any county of the second classification with
98 more than nineteen thousand seven hundred but fewer than

100 the sales tax authorized by this section shall be
101 distributed so that an amount equal to three-fourths of the
102 proceeds of the tax shall be distributed to the county and
103 the remaining one-fourth shall be distributed equally among
104 the incorporated cities, towns, and villages of the county.
105 Upon request from any city, town, or village within the
106 county, the county shall make available for inspection the
107 distribution report provided to the county by the department
108 of revenue. Any expenses incurred by the county in
109 supplying such report to a city, town, or village shall be
110 paid by such city, town, or village.

112 government and having a population of nine hundred thousand
SB 1091 5
113 or more, no tax shall be imposed pursuant to this section
114 for the purpose of funding in whole or in part the

116 field house, indoor or outdoor recreational facility,
117 center, playing field, parking facility or anything
118 incidental or necessary to a complex suitable for any type
119 of professional sport or recreation, either upon, above or
120 below the ground.
121 9. No county in this state, other than a county with a
122 charter form of government and with more than nine hundred
123 fifty thousand inhabitants and a city not within a county,
124 shall impose a tax under this section for the purpose of
125 funding in whole or in part the construction, operation, or

134 drafts deposited to the credit of such counties. If any
135 county abolishes the tax, the county shall notify the
136 director of revenue of the action at least ninety days prior
137 to the effective date of the repeal and the director of
138 revenue may order retention in the trust fund, for a period
139 of one year, of two percent of the amount collected after
140 receipt of such notice to cover possible refunds or
141 overpayment of the tax and to redeem dishonored checks and
