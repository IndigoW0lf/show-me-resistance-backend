82 3. (1) For all tax years beginning on or after
83 January 1, 2024, a tax credit shall be allowed for an
84 investor's cash investment in the qualified securities of a
85 qualified Missouri business. If the qualified Missouri
86 business is located in a community described in subdivision

93 investment in any qualified Missouri business, subject to

100 the investor is a permitted entity investor, the credit
101 provided by this section shall be claimed by the owners of

103 investment in the permitted entity investor.
104 (2) A cash investment in a qualified security shall be
105 deemed to have been made on the date of acquisition of the
106 qualified security, as such date is determined in accordance
107 with the provisions of the Internal Revenue Code of 1986, as
108 amended.
109 (3) The department and MTC shall not allow tax credits
110 of more than fifty thousand dollars for a single qualified
111 Missouri business per investor who is a natural person or
112 permitted entity investor, or a total of two hundred fifty
113 thousand dollars in tax credits for a single year per
SB 1178 5
114 investor who is a natural person or owner of a permitted
115 entity investor. No tax credits authorized by this section
116 and section 348.274 shall be allowed for any cash
117 investments in qualified securities made in any year
118 beginning after December 31, 2033. The total amount of tax
119 credits allowed under this section shall not exceed six
120 million dollars during the tax years beginning on or after
121 January 1, 2024, and ending on or before December 31, 2025.
122 For each tax year thereafter, the total amount of tax
123 credits allowed under this section shall be increased by
124 twenty percent of the total amount of tax credits allowed in
125 the immediately preceding tax year, so long as the total
126 amount of tax credits allowed in the immediately preceding
127 tax year was issued during the immediately preceding tax
128 year. The balance of unissued tax credits may be carried
129 over for issuance in future years until December 31, 2033.
130 The balance of unissued tax credits carried over, if any,
131 shall not be used in the calculation of the total amount of
132 tax credits allowed in a given tax year.
133 (4) At the beginning of each calendar year, MTC shall
134 equally designate the total tax credits available during
135 that calendar year to each geographic region comprised of
136 the boundaries of each congressional district, as such
137 boundaries may be amended from time to time, within Missouri.
138 (a) For any region that does not contain a community
139 described in subdivision (3) of subsection 2 of section
140 32.115, at the beginning of each calendar quarter, MTC shall
141 make available one-fourth of the total annual tax credits
142 for each such region for investments made in qualified
143 Missouri businesses located in each such region.
144 (b) For any region that contains a community described
145 in subdivision (3) of subsection 2 of section 32.115, on
SB 1178 6
146 January first and July first of each year, MTC shall make
147 available one-half of the total annual tax credits for each
148 such region for investments made in qualified Missouri
149 businesses located in each such region.
150 (c) As soon as practicable at the end of each calendar
151 quarter, MTC shall prepare and issue a report to the
152 director of the department designating all tax credit awards
153 for that quarter, so that the department may issue such tax
154 credits in accordance with the provisions of this section
155 and section 348.274. The report shall aggregate any
156 unissued tax credits allocated to any region for any
157 calendar quarter and divide such unissued tax credits
158 equally over each other region and make such credits
159 available for the following calendar quarter, which shall be
160 in addition to the new allocation of tax credits available
161 to that region for the calendar quarter. Except as set
162 forth in subdivision (5) of this subsection, tax credits
163 described in paragraph (b) of this subdivision shall not be
164 eligible for reallocation until the end of the semi-annual
165 period in which they were made available.
166 (5) During the fourth calendar quarter, any unissued
167 tax credits allocated to any region, which shall include the
168 aggregate tax credits that have been reallocated under the
169 provisions of this subsection and any unissued tax credits
170 allocated for the fourth quarter, may be awarded in any
171 region.

173 tax credits under this section and section 348.274, such
174 investor shall have made a cash investment in a qualified
175 security of a qualified Missouri business. The business
176 shall have been approved as a qualified Missouri business
177 before the date on which the cash investment was made. To

180 section.

204 designated if MTC determines, based upon the application
205 submitted by the business and any additional information

207 business meets established criteria, including at least the
208 following:

210 revenues of more than five million dollars in the most

63 section and section 348.273 to maintain its designation, the
64 department or MTC, by written notice, may inform the
65 business that such business will lose its designation as a
66 qualified Missouri business one hundred twenty days from the
67 date of mailing of the notice unless such business corrects
68 the deficiencies and is once again in compliance with the
69 requirements for designation.
70 (5) At the end of the one hundred twenty-day period,
71 if the qualified Missouri business is still not in
72 substantial compliance, the department or MTC may send a
73 notice of loss of designation to the business, the director
74 of the department of revenue, and to all known investors in

98 this section and section 348.273, confidential information
99 may include, but not be limited to, such portions of trade
100 secrets, documents, any customer lists, and other materials;
101 any formula, compound, production data, or compilation of
102 information that will allow certain individuals within a
103 commercial concern using such portions of documents and
104 other material the means to fabricate, produce, or compound
105 an article of trade; or any service having commercial value
106 which gives the user an opportunity to obtain a business
107 advantage over competitors who do not know or use such
108 service.
SB 1178 14
109 (10) The department and MTC may prepare and adopt
110 procedures and rules and publish guidelines concerning the
111 performance of the duties placed upon each respective entity
112 by this section and section 348.273. Any rule or portion of

114 created under the authority delegated in this section shall
115 become effective only if it complies with and is subject to
116 all of the provisions of chapter 536 and, if applicable,
117 section 536.028. This section and chapter 536 are
118 nonseverable and if any of the powers vested with the
119 general assembly pursuant to chapter 536 to review, to delay
120 the effective date, or to disapprove and annul a rule are
121 subsequently held unconstitutional, then the grant of
122 rulemaking authority and any rule proposed or adopted after
123 August 28, 2024, shall be invalid and void.
124 3. Any qualified investor who makes a cash investment
125 in a qualified security of a qualified Missouri business may
126 transfer the tax credits such qualified investor may receive
127 under subsection 3 of section 348.273 to any natural
128 person. Such transferee may claim the tax credit against
129 the transferee's Missouri income tax liability as provided
130 in subdivision (1) of subsection 3 of section 348.273,
131 subject to all restrictions and limitations set forth in
132 this section and section 348.273. Documentation of any tax
133 credit transfer under this section shall be provided by the
