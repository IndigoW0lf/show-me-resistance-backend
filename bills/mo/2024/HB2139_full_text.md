91 whatever tier who has performed in accordance with the terms of its construction
92 contract.
93 4. (1) In any construction contract between an owner and a contractor, the
94 parties shall include a provision that requires the owner to pay the contractor within
95 forty days after receipt of an invoice or pay application following satisfactory
96 completion of the portion of the work for which the contractor has sought payment.
97 Any construction contract that does not contain such a provision shall be deemed to
98 include such provision notwithstanding any language to the contrary contained in the
99 construction contract or other contract documents incorporated therein or otherwise
100 governing the construction contract. An owner shall not be required to pay amounts
101 invoiced or be subject to a contractor's pay application to the extent they are subject to
102 withholding under the contractor's construction contract with the owner due to the
103 contractor's material noncompliance with the terms of the construction contract. The
104 amount withheld shall not exceed the reasonable value of the work in material
105 noncompliance with the terms of the construction contract.
106 (2) In the event that an owner intends to withhold all or part of the amount
107 invoiced by or subject to the contractor's pay application, the owner shall give notice to
108 the contractor in writing of its intention to withhold all or part of the contractor's
109 payment. Such notice shall be given within fifteen days after the owner receives the
110 contractor's invoice or pay application and shall provide:
111 (a) The amount the owner intends to withhold;
112 (b) The specific reasons why the owner intends to withhold payment identifying
113 the work that is believed to be materially noncompliant;
114 (c) The name of the party and trade responsible for the noncompliant work with
115 sufficient information to allow the contractor to determine which, if any, subcontractor
116 or supplier may be responsible for the materially noncompliant work; and
117 (d) The extent or percentage of the amount withheld and apportioned between
118 all parties and trades, if more than one, believed to be ultimately responsible for the
119 materially noncompliant work. Any such notice that fails to reasonably apportion
120 responsibility between or among multiple parties and trades shall be deemed to be null
121 and void and ineffective.
122
123 Failure by the owner to give such notice within fifteen days after the owner receives the
124 contractor's invoice or pay application shall be deemed to be acceptance of the
125 contractor's pay application in full, subject only to the owner's right to claim later that
126 materially noncompliant work was discovered and that such work was not reasonably
127 discoverable prior to the due date for giving said notice or information.

128 5. (1) In any construction contract between a contractor and a subcontractor,
129 the parties shall include a provision that requires the contractor to pay the
130 subcontractor within seven days after receipt of payment from the owner for the
131 subcontractor's work. Any construction contract that does not contain such a provision
132 shall be deemed to include such provision notwithstanding any language to the contrary
133 contained in the construction contract or other contract documents incorporated
134 therein or otherwise governing the construction contract. Within two business days
135 after receipt of payment from the owner for one or more subcontractors' work, the
136 contractor shall notify each subcontractor in writing or electronically of the amount of
137 paymentreceivedbythecontractorforsuchsubcontractor'swork. Thecontractorshall

151 later that materially noncompliant work was discovered and that such work was not
152 reasonably discoverable prior to the due date for giving said notice or information.
153 (3) Partial payment by the owner to the contractor shall not be a basis for the
154 contractor to withhold more from the subcontractor than the owner withheld from the
155 contractor for the subcontractor's work. The contractor shall not withhold from the
156 subcontractor any more than the owner identifies as the responsibility of the
157 subcontractor.
158 (4) A sub-subcontractor or supplier shall have the same rights and
159 responsibilitiesinrelation toitssubcontractorasthesubcontractorhastoitscontractor.
160 (5) All rights and responsibilities shall flow down to all parties in the
161 construction contract chain no matter the tier. A lower-tier subcontractor and supplier,
162 at whatever tier, shall have the same rights and responsibilities in relationship to the
163 party with whom it has a construction contract as that party has with the party with
164 whom it has a construction contract. A subcontractor to a contractor shall have the
HB 2139 6
165 same rights and responsibilities as to the contractor as the contractor has in its
166 relationship with the owner; and a supplier to a subcontractor shall have the same
167 rights and responsibilities as to the subcontractor as the subcontractor has in its
168 relationship with the contractor; and a supplier to a contractor shall have the same
169 rights and responsibilities as to the contractor as the contractor has in its relationship
170 with the owner.
171 6. Theprovisions ofthissectionshallnot apply totherepairor remodelingof,or
172 the addition to, any owner-occupied residential property of four units or less where the
173 owner currently occupies, or intends to occupy, as a residence within a reasonable time

175 construction contract.
176 7. The provisions of this section shall apply only to construction contracts or
177 agreements entered into after August 28, 2024.
