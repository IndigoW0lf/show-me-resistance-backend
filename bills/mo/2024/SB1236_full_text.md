19 [2.] 3. The judge, either sua sponte or upon motion of
20 a party, may appoint a guardian ad litem to appear for and
21 represent an abused or neglected child involved in
22 proceedings arising under subsection 6 of section 210.152.
23 [3.] 4. The guardian ad litem shall be provided with
24 all reports relevant to the case made to or by any agency or
25 person, shall have access to all records of such agencies or
26 persons relating to the child or such child's family members

41 registry and access line pursuant to sections 210.900 to
42 210.937, to ensure the safety and welfare of the children
43 such persons are appointed to represent. The judge in

52 public funds. However, no fees as a judgment shall be taxed
53 against a party or parties who have not been found to have
54 abused or neglected a child or children. Such an award of

56 the guardian ad litem. Such final judgment shall be
57 enforceable against the parties in accordance with chapter
58 513.
59 [6.] 7. The court may designate volunteer advocates,
60 who may or may not be attorneys licensed to practice law, to

65 persons designated as volunteer advocates, including
66 utilization of the family care safety registry and access
67 line pursuant to sections 210.900 to 210.937, to ensure the
68 safety and welfare of the children such persons are
69 designated to represent. The volunteer advocate shall be
70 provided with all reports relevant to the case made to or by
71 any agency or person, shall have access to all records of
72 such agencies or persons relating to the child or such
73 child's family members or placements of the child, and upon
74 designation by the court to a case, shall be informed of and
75 have the right to attend any and all family support team
76 meetings involving the child. Any such designated person
77 shall receive no compensation from public funds. This shall
78 not preclude reimbursement for reasonable expenses.
SB 1236 4
79 [7.] 8. Any person appointed to perform guardian ad

84 prolonged foster care may have on a child. A nonattorney
85 volunteer advocate shall have access to a court appointed
86 attorney guardian ad litem should the circumstances of the
87 particular case so require.
1 210.830. The child shall be made a party to any action
2 commenced under sections 210.817 to 210.852. If he or she
3 is a minor, he or she may be represented by a next friend
4 appointed for him or her for any such action. The child's
5 mother or father or the family support division or any
6 person having physical or legal custody of the child may
7 represent him or her as his or her next friend. Counsel
8 shall be appointed and a guardian ad litem [shall] may be
9 appointed for the child only if child abuse or neglect is
10 alleged, or if the child is named as a defendant, or if the
11 court determines that the interests of the child and his or
12 her next friend are in conflict. The natural mother, each
13 man presumed to be the father under section 210.822, and
14 each man alleged to be the natural father, shall be made
15 parties or, if not subject to the jurisdiction of the court,

5 section 211.031.
SB 1236 5
6 2.] (1) The court shall appoint counsel for a child
7 [prior to the filing of a petition if a request is made
8 therefor to the court and the court finds that the child is
9 the subject of a juvenile court proceeding and that the
10 child making the request is indigent] in a delinquency,
11 child abuse or neglect, or termination of parental rights
12 proceeding that is conducted under this chapter. Counsel
13 shall be appointed before the first hearing and shall
14 represent the child at all stages of the proceeding and, in
15 a protective custody proceeding, through permanency,
16 including appeal. The child and the child's parent or
17 guardian shall not be represented by the same counsel.
18 [3. (1) When a petition has been filed under
19 subdivision (2) or (3) of subsection 1 of section 211.031,
20 the court may appoint counsel for the child except if

22 of the child or if counsel has been waived in accordance
23 with law; except that, counsel shall not be waived for any
24 proceeding specified under subsection 10 of this section
25 unless the child has had the opportunity to meaningfully
26 consult with counsel and the court has conducted a hearing
27 on the record.]
28 (2) If a parent or guardian is found to be indigent
29 and entitled to counsel, the juvenile court shall appoint
30 counsel unless counsel is knowingly, intelligently, and
31 voluntarily waived.
32 (3) If [a child waives his or her right to] counsel is
33 waived, such waiver shall be made in open court and be
34 recorded and in writing and shall be made knowingly,
35 intelligently, and voluntarily. In determining whether [a
36 child has] counsel is knowingly, intelligently, and
37 voluntarily waived [his or her right to counsel], the court
SB 1236 6
38 shall look to the totality of the circumstances [including,
39 but not limited to, the child's age, intelligence,
40 background, and experience generally and in the court system
41 specifically; the child's emotional stability; and the
42 complexity of the proceedings].
43 [4.] 2. When a petition has been filed and the child's
44 custodian appears before the court without counsel, the
45 court shall appoint counsel for the custodian if it finds:
46 (1) That the custodian is indigent; and
47 (2) That the custodian desires the appointment of
48 counsel; and
49 (3) That a full and fair hearing requires appointment
50 of counsel for the custodian.

56 counsel are terminated following the entry of an order of
57 disposition.
58 [7. The child and his custodian may be represented by

63 counsel if required by subsection 3 or 4 of this section.
64 8. When a petition has been filed, a child may waive
65 his or her right to counsel only with the approval of the
66 court and if such waiver is not prohibited under subsection
67 10 of this section. If a child waives his or her right to
68 counsel for any proceeding except proceedings under
69 subsection 10 of this section, the waiver shall only apply
SB 1236 7
70 to that proceeding. In any subsequent proceeding, the child
71 shall be informed of his or her right to counsel.
72 9.] 5. Waiver of counsel [by a child] may be withdrawn
73 at any stage of the proceeding, in which event the court
74 shall appoint counsel [for the child if] as required by

77 shall not be waived in any of the following proceedings:
78 (1) At any contested detention hearing under Missouri

80 the child violated any law that, if committed by an adult,
81 would be a felony unless an agreement is otherwise reached;

3 210.160,] counsel shall be appointed, as provided in section
4 211.211, and a guardian ad litem [shall] may be appointed,
5 for the child as soon as practicable after the filing of the
6 petition.
7 2. The parent or guardian of the person of the child

11 this provision shall be contained in the summons. When the
12 parent is a minor or incompetent the court shall appoint a
13 guardian ad litem to represent such parent.
14 3. The guardian ad litem shall, during all stages of
