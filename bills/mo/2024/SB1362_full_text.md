92
period, no fine shall accrue or be imposed. The

101
the fine authorized under the provisions of

105
shall retain two percent for the cost of such
106
collection. The remaining revenues collected
107
from such violations shall be distributed
108
annually to the schools of the county in the

same manner that proceeds for all penalties,
110
forfeitures, and fines collected for any breach
111
of the penal laws of the state are distributed.
112
12. Any political subdivision that has
113

taxes in the fiscal year for which the annual

117
not be subject to the fine authorized in this
118
section.
119
13. If a failure to timely submit the
120
annual financial statement is the result of
121
fraud or other illegal conduct by an employee or
122
officer of the political subdivision, the
123
political subdivision shall not be subject to a
124
fine authorized under this section if the
125
statement is filed within thirty days of the
126
discovery of the fraud or illegal conduct. If a
127
fine is assessed and paid prior to the filing of
128
the statement, the department of revenue shall
129
refund the fine upon notification from the
130
political subdivision.
131
14. If a political subdivision has an
132
outstanding balance for fines or penalties at
133
the time it files its first annual financial
134
statement after January 1, 2023, the director of
135
revenue shall make a one-time downward
136
adjustment to such outstanding balance in an
137
amount that reduces the outstanding balance by
138
no less than ninety percent.
139
15. The director of revenue shall have the
140
authority to make a one-time downward adjustment
141
to any outstanding penalty imposed under this
142
section on a political subdivision if the
143
director determines the fine is uncollectable.
144
The director of revenue may prescribe rules and
145
regulations necessary to carry out the
146
provisions of this subsection. Any rule or
147
portion of a rule, as that term is defined in
148
section 536.010, that is created under the
149
authority delegated in this section shall become
150
effective only if it complies with and is
151
subject to all of the provisions of chapter 536
152
and, if applicable, section 536.028. This
153
section and chapter 536 are nonseverable and if
154
any of the powers vested with the general
155
assembly pursuant to chapter 536 to review, to
156
delay the effective date, or to disapprove and
157
annul a rule are subsequently held
158
unconstitutional, then the grant of rulemaking
159
