13 in a durable power of attorney for health care in accordance
14 with sections 404.800 to 404.865, is not a child under the

3 acting at the direction of the physician shall make
4 reasonable efforts to inform potential designated health
5 care decision-makers set forth in section 404.1104 of whom

10 forth in subsection 1 of section 404.1104, a guardian with
11 medical decision-making authority appointed in accordance
12 with chapter 475, an attorney in fact appointed in a durable

16 authority to make health care decisions, by examining the

20 documented attempt to contact that person by telephone, with
SB 1055 5
21 all known telephone numbers and other contact information
22 used, shall be made within twenty-four hours after a
23 determination of incapacity is made as provided in section
24 404.1102.
1 404.1104. 1. If a patient is incapacitated under the
2 circumstances described in section 404.1102 and is unable to

4 does not have a legally appointed guardian, an agent under a
5 health care durable power of attorney, is not under the
6 jurisdiction of the juvenile court, or does not have any

13 patient are separated under one of the following:

29 life and who conducts or assists in the conducting of
30 religious services and actually and regularly engages in
31 religious, benevolent, charitable, or educational ministry,
32 or performance of health care services;
33 (8) Any nonrelative who can demonstrate that he or she
34 has a close personal relationship with the patient and is
35 familiar with the patient's personal values; or
36 (9) Any other person designated by the unanimous
37 mutual agreement of the persons listed above who is involved
38 in the patient's care.
39 2. If a person who is a member of the classes listed
40 in subsection 1 of this section, regardless of priority, or
41 a health care provider or a health care facility involved in
42 the care of the patient, disagrees on whether certain health
43 care should be provided to or withheld or withdrawn from a
44 patient, any such person, provider, or facility, or any
45 other person interested in the welfare of the patient may
46 petition the probate court for an order for the appointment
47 of a temporary or permanent guardian in accordance with
48 subsection 8 of this section to act in the best interest of
49 the patient.
50 3. A person who is a member of the classes listed in
51 subsection 1 of this section shall not be denied priority
52 under this section based solely upon that person's support
53 for, or direction to provide, withhold, or withdraw health
54 care to the patient, subject to the rights of other classes
55 of potential designated decision-makers, a healthcare
56 provider, or healthcare facility to petition the probate
57 court for an order for the appointment of a temporary or
58 permanent guardian under subsection 8 of this section to act
59 in the best interests of the patient.
SB 1055 7
60 4. Priority under this section shall not be given to
61 persons in any of the following circumstances:
62 (1) If a report of abuse or neglect of the patient has
63 been made pursuant to section 192.2475, 198.070, 208.912,
64 210.115, 565.188, or 630.163, or any other mandatory
65 reporting statutes, and if the health care provider knows of
66 such a report of abuse or neglect, then unless the report
67 has been determined to be unsubstantiated or unfounded, or a
68 determination of abuse was finally reversed after
69 administrative or judicial review, the person reported as
70 the alleged perpetrator of the abuse or neglect shall not be
71 given priority or authority to make health care decisions
72 pursuant to subsection 1 of this section, provided that such
73 a report shall not be based on the person's support for, or
74 direction to provide, health care to the patient;
75 (2) If the patient's physician or the physician's
76 designee reasonably determines, after making a diligent
77 effort to contact the designated health care decision-maker
78 using known telephone numbers and other contact information
79 and receiving no response, that such person is not
80 reasonably available to make medical decisions as needed or
81 is not willing to make health care decisions for the
82 patient; or
83 (3) If a probate court in a proceeding under
84 subsection 8 of this section finds that the involvement of
85 the person in decisions concerning the patient's health care
86 is contrary to instructions that the patient had
87 unambiguously, and without subsequent contradiction or
88 change, expressed before he or she became incapacitated.
89 Such a statement to the patient's physician or other health
90 care provider contemporaneously recorded in the patient's
91 medical record and signed by the patient's physician or
SB 1055 8
92 other health care provider shall be deemed such an
93 instruction, subject to the ability of a party to a
94 proceeding under subsection 8 of this section to dispute its
95 accuracy, weight, or interpretation.
96 5. (1) The designated health care decision-maker
97 shall make reasonable efforts to obtain information
98 regarding the patient's health care preferences from health
99 care providers, family, friends, or others who may have
100 credible information.
101 (2) The designated health care decision-maker, and the
102 probate court in any proceeding under subsection 8 of this
103 section, shall always make health care decisions in the
104 patient's best interests, and if the patient's religious and
105 moral beliefs and health care preferences are known and not
106 inconsistent with the patient's best interests, in
107 accordance with those beliefs and preferences.
108 6. This section does not authorize the provision or
109 withholding of health care services that the patient has
110 unambiguously, without subsequent contradiction or change of
111 instruction, expressed to the patient's physician or other
112 health care provider that he or she would or would not want
113 at a time when such patient had capacity. Such a statement
114 to the patient's physician or other health care provider,
115 contemporaneously recorded in the patient's medical record
116 and signed by the patient's physician or other health care
117 provider, shall be deemed such evidence, subject to the
118 ability of a party to a proceeding under subsection 8 of
119 this section to dispute its accuracy, weight, or
120 interpretation.
121 7. A designated health care decision-maker shall be
122 deemed a personal representative for the purposes of access
123 to and disclosure of private medical information under the
SB 1055 9
124 Health Insurance Portability and Accountability Act of 1996
125 (HIPAA), 42 U.S.C. Section 1320d and 45 CFR 160-164.
126 8. Nothing in sections 404.1100 to 404.1110 shall
127 preclude any person interested in the welfare of a patient
128 including, but not limited to, a designated health care
129 decision-maker, a member of the classes listed in subsection
130 1 of this section regardless of priority, or a health care
131 provider or health care facility involved in the care of the
132 patient, from petitioning the probate court for the
133 appointment of a temporary or permanent guardian for the
134 patient including expedited adjudication as provided in
135 chapter 475.
136 9. Pending the final outcome of proceedings initiated
137 under subsection 8 of this section, the designated health
138 care decision-maker, health care provider, or health care
139 facility shall not withhold or withdraw, or direct the
140 withholding or withdrawal, of health care, nutrition, or
141 hydration whose withholding or withdrawal, in reasonable
142 medical judgment, would result in or hasten the death of the
143 patient, would jeopardize the health or limb of the patient,
144 or would result in disfigurement or impairment of the
145 patient's faculties. If a health care provider or a health
146 care facility objects to the provision of such health care,
147 nutrition, or hydration on the basis of religious beliefs or
148 sincerely held moral convictions, the provider or facility
149 shall not impede the transfer of the patient to another
150 health care provider or health care facility willing to
151 provide it, and shall provide such health care, nutrition,
152 or hydration to the patient pending the completion of the
153 transfer. For purposes of this section, artificially
154 supplied nutrition and hydration may be withheld or
155 withdrawn during the pendency of the guardianship proceeding
SB 1055 10
156 only if, based on reasonable medical judgment, the patient's
157 physician and a second licensed physician certify that the
158 patient meets the standard set forth in subdivision (2) of
159 subsection 1 of section 404.1105. If tolerated by the
160 patient and adequate to supply the patient's needs for
161 nutrition or hydration, natural feeding should be the
162 preferred method.
1 404.1105. 1. No designated health care decision-maker
2 may, with the intent of hastening or causing the death of
3 the patient, authorize the withdrawal or withholding of
4 nutrition or hydration supplied through either natural or
5 artificial means. A designated health care decision-maker
6 may authorize the withdrawal or withholding of artificially
7 supplied nutrition and hydration only if the physician and a
8 second licensed physician certify in the patient's medical
9 record based on reasonable medical judgment that:
10 (1) Artificially supplied nutrition or hydration are
11 not necessary for comfort, care, or the relief of pain and
12 would serve only to prolong artificially the dying process
13 and where death will occur within a short period of time
14 whether or not such artificially supplied nutrition or
15 hydration is withheld or withdrawn; or
16 (2) Artificially supplied nutrition or hydration
17 cannot be physiologically assimilated or tolerated by the
18 patient.
19 2. When tolerated by the patient and adequate to
20 supply the patient's need for nutrition or hydration,
21 natural feeding should be the preferred method.
22 3. The provisions of this section shall not apply to
23 subdivision (3) of section 459.010.
1 404.1106. If any of the individuals specified in
2 section 404.1104 or the designated health care decision-
SB 1055 11
3 maker or physician believes the patient is no longer
4 incapacitated, the patient's physician shall reexamine the
5 patient and determine in accordance with reasonable medical
6 judgment whether the patient is no longer incapacitated,
7 shall certify the decision and the basis therefor in the
8 patient's medical record, and shall notify the patient, the
9 designated health care decision-maker, and the person who
10 initiated the redetermination of capacity. Rights of the
11 designated health care decision-maker shall end upon the
12 physician's certification that the patient is no longer
13 incapacitated.
1 404.1107. No health care provider or health care
2 facility that makes good faith and reasonable attempts to
3 identify, locate, and communicate with potential designated
4 health care decision-makers in accordance with sections
5 404.1100 to 404.1110 shall be subject to civil or criminal
6 liability or regulatory sanction for the effort to identify,
7 locate, and communicate with such potential designated
8 health care decision-makers.
1 404.1108. 1. A health care provider or a health care
2 facility may decline to comply with the health care decision
3 of a patient or a designated health care decision-maker if
4 such decision is contrary to the religious beliefs or
5 sincerely held moral convictions of a health care provider
6 or health care facility.
7 2. If at any time, a health care facility or health
8 care provider determines that any known or anticipated
9 health care preferences expressed by the patient to the
10 health care provider or health care facility, or as
11 expressed through the patient's designated health care
12 decision-maker, are contrary to the religious beliefs or
13 sincerely held moral convictions of the health care provider
SB 1055 12
14 or health care facility, such provider or facility shall
15 promptly inform the patient or the patient's designated
16 health care decision-maker.
17 3. If a health care provider declines to comply with
18 such health care decision, no health care provider or health
19 care facility shall impede the transfer of the patient to
20 another health care provider or health care facility willing
21 to comply with the health care decision.
22 4. Nothing in this section shall relieve or exonerate
23 a health care provider or a health care facility from the
24 duty to provide for the health care, care, and comfort of a
25 patient pending transfer under this section. If withholding
26 or withdrawing certain health care would, in reasonable
27 medical judgment, result in or hasten the death of the
28 patient, such health care shall be provided pending
29 completion of the transfer. Notwithstanding any other
30 provision of this section to the contrary, no such health
31 care shall be denied on the basis of a view that treats
32 extending the life of an elderly, disabled, or terminally
33 ill individual as of lower value than extending the life of
34 an individual who is younger, nondisabled, or not terminally
35 ill, or on the basis of the health care provider's or
36 facility's disagreement with how the patient or individual
37 authorized to act on the patient's behalf values the
38 tradeoff between extending the length of the patient's life
39 and the risk of disability.
1 404.1109. No health care decision-maker shall withhold
2 or withdraw health care from a pregnant patient, consistent
3 with existing law, as set forth in section 459.025.
1 404.1110. Nothing in sections 404.1100 to 404.1110 is
2 intended to:
SB 1055 13
3 (1) Be construed as condoning, authorizing, or
4 approving euthanasia or mercy killing; or
5 (2) Be construed as permitting any affirmative or
6 deliberate act to end a person's life, except to permit
7 natural death as provided by sections 404.1100 to 404.1110.
