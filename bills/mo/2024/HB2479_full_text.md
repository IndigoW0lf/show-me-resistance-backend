52 manufacturing zone created under section 68.075 or a targeted industrial
53 manufacturing enhancement zone created under section 620.2250, the department
54 may authorize the qualified company to receive refundable tax credits instead of

56 calendar year annual maximum amount of tax credits that may be issued to a qualified
57 company that is located in an advanced industrial manufacturing zone or targeted
58 industrial manufacturing enhancement zone may be increased by the department in an
59 amount equivalent to the amount of withholding tax remitted to the state for the

72 at a minimum, commensurate with the percentage of minority populations in the state of
73 Missouri, as reported in the previous decennial census, the following: racial minorities,
74 contractors who are racial minorities, and contractors that, in turn, employ at a minimum
75 racial minorities commensurate with the percentage of minority populations in the state of
76 Missouri, as reported in the previous decennial census, or if the number of jobs is below the
77 number required, the qualified company or qualified military project shall not receive tax
78 credits or retain the withholding tax for the balance of the project period. If a statewide state

HB 2479 8
80 development authority shall be entitled to a one-time suspension of program deadlines equal
81 to the number of months such statewide state of emergency existed with any partial month
82 rounded to the next whole. During such suspension, the qualified company or industrial
83 development authority shall not be entitled to retain any withholding tax as calculated under
84 subdivision (38) of section 620.2005 nor shall it earn any awarded tax credit or receive any
85 tax credit under the program for the suspension period. The suspension period shall run
86 consecutively and be available to a qualified company or industrial development authority
87 that, during the statewide state of emergency, submitted notice of intent that was approved or
88 that was in year one or a subsequent year of benefits under a program agreement with the
89 department. The suspension period that runs consecutively and may be available to a
90 qualified company or industrial development authority as provided in this subsection may
91 apply retroactively. Any qualified company or industrial development authority requesting a
92 suspension pursuant to this subsection shall submit notice to the department on its provided
93 form identifying the requested start and end dates of the suspension, not to exceed the
94 maximum number of months available under this subsection. Such notice shall be submitted
95 to the department not later than the end of the twelfth month following the termination of the

98 development authority shall enter into a program agreement or shall amend an existing
99 program agreement, as applicable, stating the deadlines following the suspension period and
100 updating the applicable wage requirements. Failure to timely file the annual report required
101 under this section may result in the forfeiture of tax credits attributable to the year for which
102 the reporting was required and a recapture of withholding taxes retained by the qualified
103 company or qualified military project during such year.

110 that the qualified company has exceeded the applicable percentage of county average wage
111 and the required number of jobs; provided that, tax credits awarded under subsection 7 of
112 section 620.2010 may be issued following the qualified company's acceptance of the
113 department's proposal and pursuant to the requirements set forth in the written agreement
114 between the department and the qualified company under subsection 4 of section 620.2010.

120 approved for benefits under this program shall be subject to the provisions of sections
121 135.800 to 135.830.
122 6. Any taxpayer who is awarded benefits under this program who knowingly hires
