12 notification center and who were communicated to the
13 excavator as notification center participants who would be
14 informed of the excavation notice. Notice to the
15 notification center of proposed excavation shall be deemed
16 notice to all owners and operators of underground
17 facilities. The notice referred to in this section shall
18 comply with the provisions of section 319.026.
19 2. An excavator's notice to owners and operators of
20 underground facilities participating in the notification
21 center pursuant to section 319.022 is ineffective for
22 purposes of subsection 1 of this section unless given to
23 such notification center.
24 3. Notification center participants shall be relieved
25 of the responsibility to respond to a notice of intent to
SB 1315 10
26 excavate received directly from the person intending to
27 commence an excavation, except for requests for
28 clarification of markings through on-site meetings as
29 provided in subsection 1 of section 319.030 and requests for
30 locations at the time of an emergency as provided by section
31 319.050.
32 4. Notwithstanding the provisions of this section to

34 excavation in any state highway, or on the right-of-way of
35 any state highway, without first obtaining a permit from the
36 state highways and transportation commission pursuant to
37 section 227.240, provided however, the provisions of this
38 subsection shall not apply to railroad right-of-way owned or
39 operated by a railroad.
1 319.026. 1. An excavator shall serve notice of intent
2 to excavate to the notification center by toll-free
3 telephone number operated on a twenty-four hour per-day,
4 seven day per-week basis [or by facsimile] or by completing
5 notice via the internet at least two working days, but not
6 more than ten working days, before the expected date of
7 commencing the excavation activity. The notification center
8 receiving such notice shall inform the excavator of all
9 notification center participants to whom such notice will be
10 transmitted and shall promptly transmit all details of such
11 notice provided under subsection 2 of this section to every
12 notification center participant in the area of excavation.
13 2. Notices of intent to excavate given pursuant to
14 this section shall contain the following information:
15 (1) The name and telephone number of the person filing
16 the notice of excavation, if the telephone number is
17 different than that of the excavator, and the name, address,
SB 1315 11
18 and telephone number of the excavator [and whether the
19 excavator's telephone is equipped with a recording device];
20 (2) The date the excavation activity is expected to
21 commence, the depth of planned excavation and, if
22 applicable, that the use of explosives is anticipated on the
23 excavation site, and the type of excavation being planned,
24 including whether the excavation involves trenchless
25 excavation;
26 (3) The [facsimile number,] email address[,] and
27 cellular telephone number of the excavator, if any;
28 (4) The name of the person primarily responsible for
29 conducting the excavation or managing the excavation
30 process, and if any of the information stated in subdivision
31 (1) or (3) of this subsection is different for the person
32 primarily responsible for the excavation, the notice shall
33 also state the same information for that person;
34 (5) A detailed description accepted by the
35 notification center sufficient for the location of the
36 excavation by any one or more of the following means: by
37 reference to a specific street address, or by description of
38 location in relation to the nearest numbered, lettered, or
39 named state or county road or city street for which a road
40 sign is posted, or by latitude and longitude including the
41 appropriate description in degrees, minutes, and seconds, or
42 by state plane coordinates;
43 (6) A description of the site of excavation by
44 approximate distance and direction from the nearest state or
45 county road or city street or intersection of such roads or
46 streets unless previously provided under subdivision (5) of
47 this subsection, and the proximity of the site to any
48 prominent landmarks;
SB 1315 12

53 (8) Directions as to how to reach the site of the
54 excavation from the nearest such road, if the excavation is
55 not on or near a posted numbered, lettered, or named state
56 or county road or city street.
57 3. When the location of the planned excavation cannot
58 be clearly identified solely by the means described in
59 subdivision (5) of subsection 2 of this section, the
60 excavator may also designate the planned excavation route or
61 area to be excavated by physical white lining using white
62 paint, stakes, whiskers, or other similar markings on and
63 along the area to be excavated, or by electronic white
64 lining when available through the notification center. Such
65 information may be provided to the notification center prior
66 to or with the notification required under this section.
67 4. The notification center receiving such notice shall
68 solicit all information required by subsection 2 of this
69 section and shall require the excavator to provide all such
70 information before notice by the excavator is deemed to be
71 completed pursuant to sections 319.015 to 319.050. The
72 notification center shall transmit all details of such
73 notice as required by this section.
74 [4.] 5. A record of each notice of intent to excavate
75 shall be maintained by the notification center for a period
76 of five years. The record shall include the date the notice
77 was received and all information required by subsection 2 of
78 this section which was provided by the excavator and a
79 record of the underground facility owners notified by the
80 notification center. If the notification center creates a
SB 1315 13
81 record of the notice by telephonic recording, such record of
82 the original notice shall be maintained for one year from
83 the date of receipt. Records of notices to excavate
84 maintained by the notification center in electronic form
85 shall be deemed to be records under this subsection.
86 Persons holding records of notices of intent to excavate and
87 records of information provided to the excavator by the
88 notification center or owner or operator of the facility
89 shall make copies of such records available for a reasonable
90 copying fee upon the request of the owner or operator of the
91 underground facilities or the excavator filing the notice.
92 [5.] 6. If in the course of excavation the person
93 responsible for the excavation operations discovers that the
94 owner or operator of the underground facility who is a
95 participant in a notification center has incorrectly located
96 the underground facility, or if the discovery of an
97 underground facility is not marked, he or she shall notify
98 the notification center which shall inform the underground
99 facility owner. The underground facility owner shall
100 respond to the incorrect locate notification within two
101 hours of receipt of the notification by contacting the
102 person responsible for the excavation or by correctly
103 locating their underground facility. The person responsible
104 for maintaining records of the location of underground
105 facilities for the notification center participant shall
106 correct such records to show the actual location of such
107 facilities, if current records are incorrect.
108 [6.] 7. When markings have been provided in response
109 to a notice of intent to excavate, excavators may commence
110 or continue to work within the area described in the notice
111 for so long as the markings are visible. If an excavator is
112 unable to begin the excavation within ten working days as
SB 1315 14
113 described in the request, the excavator shall make a
114 relocate request before beginning the excavation. If
115 markings become unusable due to weather, construction or
116 other cause, the excavator shall contact the notification
117 center to request remarking. Such notice shall be given in
118 the same manner as original notice of intent to excavate,
119 and the owner or operator shall remark the site in the same
120 manner, within the same time, as required in response to an
121 original notice of intent to excavate. Each excavator shall
122 exercise reasonable care not to unnecessarily disturb or
123 obliterate markings provided for location of underground
124 facilities. If remarking is required due to the excavator's
125 failure to exercise reasonable care, or if repeated
126 unnecessary requests for remarking are made by an excavator
127 even though the markings are visible and usable, the
128 excavator may be liable to the owner or operator for the
129 reasonable cost of such remarking. Nothing in this section
130 shall allow any person other than the facility owner or
131 their representative to mark or relocate any underground
132 facility.
133 [7.] 8. Before commencing excavation, the excavator
134 shall determine best practices for confirming the horizontal
135 and vertical location of facilities at the site of
136 excavation considering conditions at the site including
137 geology, access to the site, and the presence of paved
138 surfaces. Hand digging or soft digging shall be used as a
139 best practice when possible.
140 [8.] 9. In the event of any damage, dislocation, or
141 disturbance of any underground facility in connection with
142 any excavation, the person responsible for the excavation
143 operations shall notify the notification center. This
144 subsection shall be deemed to require reporting of any
SB 1315 15
145 damage, dislocation, or disturbance to trace wires,
146 encasements, cathode protection, permanent above-ground
147 stakes, or other such items utilized for protection of the
148 underground facility. The notification center shall
149 promptly notify the owner of the underground facility of
150 such damage, dislocation, or disturbance. The excavator
151 shall immediately contact 911 when any damage or contact
152 with a pipeline results in a release from the pipeline of
153 hazardous liquid or gas to occur.
154 10. The owner of the underground facility shall,
155 within sixty days of the earlier of receipt of notice as
156 required under subsection 9 of this section or actual notice
157 by other means of an incident involving damage, dislocation,
158 or disturbance of the underground facility, submit a report
159 of the incident to the notification center and the excavator
160 which includes the following:
161 (1) A description of the incident, including whether
162 it resulted in real or personal property damage, personal
163 injury, or death;
164 (2) A description of the damage to the underground
165 facility;
166 (3) The actual or estimated cost to repair the damaged
167 facility or other property; and
168 (4) An intent to assert a claim against the excavator.
169 If any of the information required in the incident report is
170 not known or reasonably available to the facility owner,
171 such information shall be reported by the facility owner to
172 the notification center within sixty days of the submission
173 of the initial report. Except for information subject to
174 protection by an individual privacy interest as determined
175 by the notification center, any information contained in the
SB 1315 16
176 incident report shall be available for public inquiry. The
177 notification center shall maintain a database of incident
178 reports and each incident report shall be maintained by the
179 notification center for a minimum of five years. It shall
180 be a continuing obligation of the underground facility owner
181 to submit incident reports when an incident occurs. If an
182 underground facility owner fails to timely submit an
183 incident report in accordance with this subsection, the
184 owner shall be subject to a fine imposed by the attorney
185 general under the authority of section 319.045, not to
186 exceed two hundred fifty dollars per day until such incident
187 report is filed and not to exceed five thousand dollars in
188 the aggregate. The filing of an incident report shall be a
189 condition precedent to the right of a facility owner to file
190 and maintain a lawsuit for damages against an excavator as a
191 result of a violation of sections 319.015 to 319.050.
192 [9.] 11. In the event of any damage, dislocation, or
193 disturbance to any underground facility or any protective
194 devices required to be reported by the excavator under
195 subsection [8] 9 of this section in advance of or during the
196 excavation work, the person responsible for the excavation
197 operations shall not conceal or attempt to conceal such
198 damage, dislocation, or disturbance, nor shall that person
199 attempt to make repairs to the facility unless authorized by
200 the underground facility owner. In the case of sewer lines
201 or facilities, emergency temporary repairs may be made by
202 the excavator after notification without the owners' or
203 operators' authorization to prevent further damage to the
204 facilities. Such emergency repairs shall not relieve the
205 excavator of responsibility to make notification as required
206 by subsection [8] 9 of this section.
SB 1315 17
207 [10.] 12. No later than April [1, 2015, and] first of
208 each year [thereafter], each underground facility owner who
209 owns or operates electric, gas, or pipeline facilities shall
210 submit to a central repository designated by the
211 notification center a report of damages experienced by its
212 facilities for the prior calendar year. The notification
213 center shall determine the minimum information to be
214 reported. All data submitted shall be aggregated and
215 anonymous. Information provided by the underground facility
216 owner specific to damage data submitted shall be accessible
217 only to the underground facility owner unless otherwise
218 designated by the underground facility owner.
219 13. In the event of any damage, dislocation, or
220 disturbance to any underground facility or any protective
221 devices required to be reported by the excavator under
222 subsection 9 of this section in advance of or during the
223 excavation work, the person responsible for the excavation
224 operations shall report the occurrence through the Damage
225 Information Reporting Tool (DIRT) sponsored by the Common
226 Ground Alliance and in accordance with best practices.
1 319.027. 1. Any person may make design requests by
2 contacting the notification center. Such design requests
3 shall include all information deemed necessary by the
4 notification center to complete the notice, including the
5 identification of the person and a description of the
6 location of the project being designed and other information
7 similar to that required of excavators under section 319.026.
8 2. Design requests shall be made to the notification
9 center at least five working days[, but not more than ten
10 working days,] before the date the person has requested
11 receiving the information from the underground facility
12 owner. Upon receipt of a design request, the notification
SB 1315 18
13 center shall inform the person of the name of all
14 notification center participants to whom the notice will be
15 transmitted and shall promptly transmit such notice to the
16 appropriate underground facility owners.
17 3. Every underground facility owner who receives a
18 design request shall mark the location of the facility, or
19 contact the person making the request, within five working
20 days after the date the notice was received from the
21 notification center. If the person making the request was
22 contacted as an alternative to marking location, the person
23 and the underground facility owner shall mutually agree on a
24 schedule and method for providing the information, provided
25 that the facility shall be marked within five working days
26 if the facility owner and the person making the request are
27 unable to agree.
28 4. No excavation may be commenced based upon
29 information received through a design request. Obtaining
30 information through a design request shall not excuse any
31 person commencing an excavation from making notice and
32 obtaining information under sections 319.025 and 319.026
33 concerning the possible location of any underground
34 facilities which may be affected.
1 319.030. 1. Every person owning or operating an
2 underground facility to whom notice of intent to excavate is
3 required to be given shall, upon receipt of such notice as
4 provided in this section from a person intending to commence
5 an excavation, inform the excavator as promptly as
6 practical, but not in excess of two working days, unless the
7 excavator agrees to extend the start date and time provided
8 in the locate request through methods established by the
9 notification center, of the approximate location of
10 underground facilities in or near the area of the excavation
SB 1315 19
11 so as to enable the person engaged in the excavation work to
12 locate the facilities in advance of and during the
13 excavation work, provided that no excavation shall begin
14 earlier than the scheduled excavation date provided on the
15 locate request unless the excavator has confirmed that all
16 underground facilities have been located. The two working
17 days provided for notice in this subsection and subsection 1
18 of section 319.026 shall begin at 12:00 a.m. following the
19 receipt of the request by the notification center. Each
20 underground facility owner receiving notifications from the
21 notification center by use of the internet shall, after
22 December 31, 2014, use the locate status system provided by
23 the notification center. Those underground facility owners
24 that do not receive notifications by use of the internet
25 shall, no later than January 1, 2016, provide locate status
26 to the notification center by an alternate method provided
27 by the notification center. If the excavator states in the
28 notice of intent to excavate that the excavation will
29 involve trenchless technology, the owner or operator shall
30 inform the excavator of the depth, to the best of his [or],
31 her, or its knowledge or ability, of the facility according
32 to the records of the owner or operator. The owner or
33 operator shall provide the approximate location of
34 underground facilities by use of markings as designated in
35 section 319.015. Persons representing the excavator and the
36 owner or operator shall meet on the site of excavation
37 within two working days of a request by either person for
38 such meeting for the purpose of clarifying markings, or upon
39 agreement of the excavator and owner or operator, such
40 meeting may be an alternate means of providing the location
41 of facilities by originally marking the approximate location
42 of the facility at the time of the meeting. If upon receipt
SB 1315 20
43 of a notice of intent to excavate, an owner or operator
44 determines that he or she neither owns or operates
45 underground facilities in or near the area of excavation,
46 the owner or operator shall within two working days after
47 receipt of the notice, inform the excavator that the owner
48 or operator has no facilities located in the area of the
49 proposed excavation. The owner or operator of the
50 underground facility shall make notice to the excavator that
51 no facilities are located in the area of excavation by
52 contacting the excavator by any of the following methods:
53 (1) By calling the primary number of the excavator or
54 by calling the telephone number of the responsible person as
55 provided by the excavator under subdivision (4) of
56 subsection 2 of section 319.026;
57 (2) By leaving a message on the recording device for
58 such numbers;
59 (3) By calling the cellular telephone number of the
60 excavator or responsible person;
61 (4) By notifying the excavator by [facsimile or]
62 electronic mail at [numbers or] addresses stated by the
63 excavator in the notice of excavation made under subsection
64 2 of section 319.026;
65 (5) By marking "clear" or "OK" at the site of
66 excavation;
67 (6) By verbally informing the excavator in person.
68 If the only means of contacting the excavator is one or more
69 telephone numbers provided by the excavator in the notice of
70 excavation under section 319.026, then two attempts by the
71 underground facility owner to contact the excavator at one
72 of the telephone numbers provided shall constitute
73 compliance with this subsection; or
SB 1315 21
74 (7) By use of a locate status system.
75 2. A record of the date and means of informing the
76 excavator that no facilities were located by the owner or
77 operator shall be included in the written records of the
78 underground facility owner regarding each specific notice of
79 excavation and shall be retained for a period of five years.
80 3. If the owner or operator notifies the excavator
81 that the area of excavation cannot be determined from the
82 description provided by the excavator through the notice
83 required by this section, the excavator shall provide
84 clarification of the area of excavation by marking the area
85 with white flags or white paint, or by providing project
86 plans to the owner or operator, or by meeting on the site of
87 the excavation with representatives of the owner or operator
88 as provided for in this section.
89 4. In the event that a person owning or operating an
90 underground facility fails to comply with the provisions of
91 subsection 1 of this section after notice given by an
92 excavator in compliance with section 319.026, the excavator,
93 prior to commencing the excavation, shall give a second
94 notice to the notification center as required by section
95 319.026 stating that there has been no response to the
96 original notice given under section 319.026. After the
97 receipt of the notice stating there has been "no response",
98 the owner or operator of an underground facility shall,
99 within two hours of the receipt of such notice, mark its
100 facilities or contact and inform the excavator of when the
101 facilities will be marked; provided, however, that for "no
102 response" notices made to the notification center by 2:00
103 p.m., the markings shall be completed on the working day the
104 notice is made to the notification center, and provided that
105 for "no response" notices made to the notification center
SB 1315 22
106 after 2:00 p.m., the markings shall be completed no later
107 than 10:00 a.m. on the next working day. If an underground
108 facility owner fails to mark its facilities or contact the
109 excavator as required by this subsection, the excavator may
110 commence the excavation. Nothing in this subsection shall
111 excuse the excavator from exercising the degree of care in
112 making the excavation as is otherwise required by law.
113 5. For purposes of this section, a period of two
114 working days begins at 12:00 a.m. following when the request
115 is made.
1 319.031. 1. In addition to the other requirements of
2 section 319.030, the response to a notice of intent to
3 excavate received by a sewer system owner, when such owner
4 has underground facilities located in the area of excavation
5 identified in the notice and when the notice indicates that
6 trenchless excavation methods will be used, shall include a
7 determination of whether sewer service connections exist in
8 the area of the excavation.
9 2. If the sewer system owner determines that sewer
10 service connections exist in the area of the excavation
11 identified in a notice of intent to excavate, the owner
12 shall provide his [or], her, or its best available
13 information, or notice that the information does not exist,
14 regarding the location of such connections to the excavator
15 by any of the following methods:
16 (1) Placing a triangular green mark at the approximate
17 location of the sewer service connection pointing in the
18 direction of the customer structure serviced;
19 (2) Providing electronic copies of the information to
20 the excavator;
21 (3) Delivering copies of the information to the
22 excavator by [facsimile or by] other agreed upon means; or
SB 1315 23
23 (4) Arranging to meet the excavator at the site of the
24 excavation to provide the information.
25 3. Providing the best available information, or notice
26 that the information does not exist, regarding the location
27 of sewer service connections that exist in the area of
28 excavation identified in a notice of intent to excavate
29 shall constitute full compliance with this section, and a
30 sewer system owner shall not be liable to any party for
31 damages or injuries resulting from an excavation if they are
32 in compliance with this section.
33 4. Providing the best available information regarding
34 the location of sewer service connections that exist in the
35 area of excavation identified in a notice of intent to
36 excavate shall not in and of itself constitute ownership,
37 operation, control, or management of sewer service lines by
38 a sewer system owner.
1 319.034. 1. For purposes of sections 319.010 to
2 319.050, the location of underground facilities provided by
3 a facility owner or operator in accordance with section
4 319.026 to any person engaging in scheduled excavating shall
5 be accurate. If any underground facility becomes damaged by
6 an excavator due to the furnishing of inaccurate information
7 as to its location by the facility owner or operator, the
8 excavator shall not be subject to any liability resulting
9 from damage to the underground facility as a result of the
10 excavating, provided that such person engaging in scheduled
11 excavating complies with the requirements of sections
12 319.010 to 319.050 with respect to such excavation and there
13 is no evidence visible and obvious to the excavator of the
14 presence of a mismarked underground facility.
15 2. Upon documented evidence that the person seeking
16 information as to the location of underground facilities has
SB 1315 24
17 incurred losses or expenses due to inaccurate information,
18 lack of information, or unreasonable delays in supplying
19 information by the facility owners or operators, such
20 facility owners or operators shall be liable to such person
21 for any losses or expenses.
1 319.035. 1. Obtaining information as required by
2 sections 319.010 to 319.050 does not excuse any person
3 making any excavation from doing so in a careful and prudent
4 manner.
5 2. Nothing in sections 319.010 to 319.050 shall
6 relieve an excavator from the obligation to excavate in a
7 safe and prudent manner, nor shall it absolve an excavator
8 from liability for damage to underground facilities.
9 3. [The failure of any excavator to give notice of
10 proposed excavation activities as required by this chapter
11 shall be a rebuttable presumption of negligence on his or
12 her part in the event that such failure shall cause injury,
13 loss, or damage. In addition to any penalties provided
14 herein, liability under common law may apply] In addition to
15 any fines or penalties payable to the state as provided in
16 sections 319.010 to 309.050, a person injured by the
17 negligence of an excavator or an underground facility owner
18 or operator may recover any proximately caused damages
19 allowed under the common law.
20 4. The failure of an underground facility owner or a
21 locator or other contractor engaged by the facility owner to
22 mark [his or her] the facility owner's facilities that are
23 located in an area of excavation described in a notice of
24 intent to excavate received by the underground facility
25 owner, as required by section 319.030, or the failure of an
26 underground facility owner to be a notification center
27 participant, consistent with the provisions of section
SB 1315 25
28 319.022, shall be a rebuttable presumption of negligence on
29 the part of such owner, and of the locator or other
30 contractor engaged by the facility owner, in the event that
31 such failure shall cause injury, loss, or damage. In
32 addition to any penalties provided herein, liability under
33 common law may apply.
34 5. The failure of any excavator to give notice of
35 proposed excavation activities as required under sections
36 319.010 to 319.050 shall be a rebuttable presumption of
37 negligence on the part of the excavator in the event that
38 such failure causes injury, loss, or damage.
39 6. If a court finds in any civil action commenced
40 under sections 319.010 to 319.050 that a cause of action was
41 initiated or a defense was asserted frivolously and in bad
42 faith, the court may require the party who initiated such
43 cause or asserted such defense to pay the other party named
44 in such action reasonable expenses and attorney's fees
45 incurred to oppose such cause or defense.
