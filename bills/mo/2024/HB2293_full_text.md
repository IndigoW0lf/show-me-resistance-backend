25 district. If a special administrative board is appointed for the operation of a part of a school
26 district, the state board of education shall determine an equitable apportionment of state and

39 appoint a superintendent of schools to serve as the chief executive officer of the school
40 district, or a subset of schools, and to have all powers and duties of any other general
41 superintendent of schools in a seven-director school district. Any special administrative
42 board appointed under this section shall be responsible for the operation of the district or part
43 of the district until such time that the district is classified by the state board of education as
44 provisionally accredited for at least two successive academic years, after which time the state
45 board of education [may] shall provide for a transition pursuant to section 162.083; [or]
46 (b) Determine an alternative governing structure for the district including, at a
47 minimum:
48 a. A rationale for the decision to use an alternative form of governance and in the
49 absence of the district's achievement of full accreditation, the state board of education shall
50 review and recertify the alternative form of governance every three years;
51 b. A method for the residents of the district to provide public comment after a stated
52 period of time or upon achievement of specified academic objectives;
53 c. Expectations for progress on academic achievement, which shall include an
54 anticipated time line for the district to reach full accreditation; and

59 (c) Attach the territory of the lapsed district to another district or districts for school
60 purposes; or

75 subsection 3 of this section in the following school year.
