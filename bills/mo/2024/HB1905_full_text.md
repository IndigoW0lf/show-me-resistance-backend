161.670. 1. Notwithstanding any other law, prior to July 1, 2007, the state board of
2 education shall establish the "Missouri Course Access and Virtual School Program" to serve
3 school-age students residing in the state. The Missouri course access and virtual school
4 program shall offer nonclassroom-based instruction in a virtual setting using technology,
5 intranet, or internet methods of communication. Any student under the age of twenty-one in
6 grades kindergarten through twelve who resides in this state shall be eligible to enroll in the

21 state school aid payments made under section 163.031, to such institution an amount equal to
22 the state adequacy target multiplied by the weighted average daily attendance of such full-
23 time students.
24 (2) The Missouri course access and virtual school program shall report to the district
25 of residence the following information about each student served by the Missouri course
26 access and virtual school program: name, address, eligibility for free or reduced-price lunch,
27 limited English proficiency status, special education needs, and the number of courses in
28 which the student is enrolled. The Missouri course access and virtual school program shall
29 promptly notify the resident district when a student discontinues enrollment. A "full-time
30 equivalent student" is a student who is enrolled in the instructional equivalent of six credits
31 per regular term. Each Missouri course access and virtual school program course shall count
32 as one class and shall generate that portion of a full-time equivalent that a comparable course
33 offered by the school district would generate.
34 (3) Pursuant to an education services plan and collaborative agreement under
35 subsection 3 of this section, full-time equivalent students may be allowed to use a physical
36 locationoftheresidentschooldistrictforallorsomeportionofongoinginstructionalactivity,
37 and the enrollment plan shall provide for reimbursement of costs of the resident district for
38 providing such access pursuant to rules promulgated under this section by the department.
39 (4) In no case shall more than the full-time equivalency of a regular term of
40 attendance for a single student be used to claim state aid. Full-time equivalent student credit
41 completed shall be reported to the department of elementary and secondary education in the
42 manner prescribed by the department. Nothing in this section shall prohibit students from
43 enrolling in additional courses under a separate agreement that includes terms for paying
44 tuition or course fees.
45 (5) A full-time virtual school program serving full-time equivalent students shall be
46 considered an attendance center in the host school district and shall participate in the
47 statewide assessment system as defined in section 160.518. The academic performance of
48 students enrolled in a full-time virtual school program shall be assigned to the designated
49 attendance center of the full-time virtual school program and shall be considered in like
HB 1905 3
50 mannertootherattendancecenters. Theacademicperformanceofanystudentwhodisenrolls
51 from a full-time virtual school program and enrolls in a public school or charter school shall
52 not be used in determining the annual performance report score of the attendance center or
53 school district in which the student enrolls for twelve months from the date of enrollment.
54 (6) For the purposes of this section, a public institution of higher education operating
55 a full-time virtual school program shall be subject to all requirements applicable to a host
56 school district with respect to its full-time equivalent students.
57 3. (1) A student who resides in this state may enroll in Missouri course access and
58 virtual school program courses of his or her choice as a part of the student's annual course
59 load each school year, with any costs associated with such course or courses to be paid by the
60 school district or charter school if:
61 (a) The student is enrolled full-time in a public school, including any charter school;
62 and
63 (b) Prior to enrolling in any Missouri course access and virtual school program
64 course, a student has received approval from his or her school district or charter school
65 through the procedure described under subdivision (2) of this subsection.
66 (2) Each school district or charter school shall adopt a policy that delineates the
67 process by which a student may enroll in courses provided by the Missouri course access and
68 virtual school program that is substantially similar to the typical process by which a district
69 student would enroll in courses offered by the school district and a charter school student
70 would enroll in courses offered by the charter school. The policy may include consultation
71 withtheschool'scounselorandmayincludeparentalnotificationorauthorization. Thepolicy
72 shall ensure that available opportunities for in-person instruction are considered prior to
73 moving a student to virtual courses. The policy shall allow for continuous enrollment
74 throughout the school year. If the school district or charter school disapproves a student's
75 request to enroll in a course or courses provided by the Missouri course access and virtual
76 school program, the reason shall be provided in writing and it shall be for good cause. Good
77 cause justification to disapprove a student's request for enrollment in a course shall be a
78 determination that doing so is not in the best educational interest of the student, and shall be
79 consistent with the determination that would be made for such course request under the
80 process by which a district student would enroll in a similar course offered by the school
81 district and a charter school student would enroll in a similar course offered by the charter
82 school, except that the determination may consider the suitability of virtual courses for the
83 student based on prior participation in virtual courses by the student. Appeals of any course
84 denials under this subsection shall be considered under a policythat is substantially similar to
85 the typical process by which appeals would be considered for a student seeking to enroll in
HB 1905 4
86 courses offered by the school district and a charter school student seeking to enroll in courses
87 offered by the charter school.
88 (3) For students enrolled in any Missouri course access and virtual school program
89 course in which costs associated with such course are to be paid by the school district or
90 charter school as described under this subdivision, the school district or charter school shall
91 pay the content provider directly on a pro rata monthly basis based on a student's completion
92 of assignments and assessments. If a student discontinues enrollment, the district or charter
93 school may stop making monthly payments to the content provider. No school district or
94 charter school shall pay, for any one course for a student, more than the market necessary
95 costs but in no case shall pay more than fourteen percent of the state adequacy target, as
96 defined under section 163.011, as calculated at the end of the most recent school year for any
97 single, year-long course and no more than seven percent of the state adequacy target as
98 described above for any single semester equivalent course.

126 the student's parent or guardian, the host district, and the resident district;
127 (h) Provide a process for reviewing appeals of decisions made under this subdivision;
128 and
129 (i) Require the department to publish an annual report based on the enrollments and
130 enrollment surveys conducted under this subdivision that provides data at the statewide and
131 district levels of sufficient detail to allow analysis of trends regarding the reasons for
132 participation in the virtual program at the statewide and district levels; provided that no such
133 survey results will be published in a manner that reveals individual student information. The
134 department shall also include, in the annual report, data at the statewide and district levels of
135 sufficient detail to allow detection and analysis of the racial, ethnic, and socio-economic
136 balance of virtual program participation among schools and districts at the statewide and
137 district levels, provided that no such survey results will be published in a manner that reveals
138 individual student information.

6 unless allocated, apportioned, or decreed, the parents shall confer with one another in the
7 exercise of decision-making rights, responsibilities, and authority;
8 (3) "Joint physical custody" means an order awarding each of the parents significant,
9 but not necessarily equal, periods of time during which a child resides with or is under the

11 parents in such a way as to assure the child of frequent, continuing and meaningful contact
12 with both parents;
13 (4) "Third-party custody" means a third party designated as a legal and physical
14 custodian pursuant to subdivision (5) of subsection 5 of this section.
15 2. Thecourtshalldeterminecustodyinaccordancewiththebestinterestsofthechild.
16 There shall be a rebuttable presumption that an award of equal or approximately equal
17 parenting time to each parent is in the best interests of the child. Such presumption is
18 rebuttable only by a preponderance of the evidence in accordance with all relevant factors,
19 including,butnotlimitedto,thefactorscontainedinsubdivisions(1)to(8)ofthissubsection.
20 The presumption may be rebutted if the court finds that the parents have reached an
21 agreement on all issues related to custody, or if the court finds that a pattern of domestic
22 violence has occurred as set out in subdivision (6) of this subsection. When the parties have
23 not reached an agreement on all issues related to custody, the court shall consider all relevant
24 factors and enter written findings offact and conclusions of law, including, but not limited to,
25 the following:
26 (1) The wishes of the child's parents as to custody and the proposed parenting plan
27 submitted by both parties;

32 other person who may significantly affect the child's best interests;
33 (4) Which parent is more likely to allow the child frequent, continuing and
34 meaningful contact with the other parent;
35 (5) Thechild'sadjustmenttothechild'shome,school,andcommunity. Thefactthata
36 parent sends his or her child or children to a home school or FLEX school, as defined in

38 such child or children;
39 (6) The mental and physical health of all individuals involved, including any history
40 of abuse of any individuals involved. If the court finds that a pattern of domestic violence as
41 defined in section 455.010 has occurred, and, if the court also finds that awarding custody to

70 frequent, continuing and meaningful contact with both parents after the parents have
71 separatedordissolvedtheirmarriageisinthebestinterestofthechild,exceptforcaseswhere
72 the court specifically finds that such contact is not in the best interest of the child, and that it
73 is the public policy of this state to encourage parents to participate in decisions affecting the
74 health, education and welfare of their children, and to resolve disputes involving their
75 childrenamicably through alternative dispute resolution. Inorder to effectuate these policies,
76 the general assembly encourages the court to enter a temporary parenting plan as early as
77 practicable in a proceeding under this chapter, consistent with the provisions of subsection 2
78 ofthis section,and, in sodoing,the courtshall determine thecustody arrangementwhich will
79 best assure both parents participate in such decisions and have frequent, continuing and
80 meaningful contact with their children so long as it is in the best interests of the child.
81 5. Prior to awarding the appropriate custody arrangement in the best interest of the
82 child, the court shall consider each of the following as follows:
83 (1) Joint physical and joint legal custody to both parents, which shall not be denied
84 solely for the reason that one parent opposes a joint physical and joint legal custody award.
85 The residence of one of the parents shall be designated as the address of the child for mailing
86 and educational purposes;
87 (2) Jointphysicalcustodywithonepartygrantedsolelegalcustody. Theresidenceof
88 one of the parents shall be designated as the address of the child for mailing and educational
89 purposes;
90 (3) Joint legal custody with one party granted sole physical custody;
91 (4) Sole custody to either parent; or
92 (5) Third-party custody or visitation:
93 (a) When the court finds that each parent is unfit, unsuitable, or unable to be a
94 custodian, or the welfare of the child requires, and it is in the best interests of the child, then
95 custody,temporarycustodyorvisitationmaybeawardedtoapersonrelatedbyconsanguinity
96 oraffinity to the child. If no person related to the child by consanguinity or affinity iswilling
97 to accept custody, then the court may award custody to any other person or persons deemed
98 by the court to be suitable and able to provide an adequate and stable environment for the
99 child. Before the court awards custody, temporary custody or visitation to a third person
100 under this subdivision, the court shall make that person a party to the action;
HB 1905 28
101 (b) Under the provisions of this subsection, any person may petition the court to
102 intervene as a party in interest at any time as provided by supreme court rule.
103 6. If the parties have not agreed to a custodial arrangement, or the court determines
104 such arrangement is not in the best interest of the child, the court shall include a written
105 finding in the judgment or order based on the public policy in subsection 4 of this section and
106 each of the factors listed in subdivisions (1) to (8) of subsection 2 of this section detailing the
107 specificrelevant factorsthat madeaparticulararrangement inthebest interestofthechild. If
108 a proposed custodial arrangement is rejected by the court, the court shall include a written
109 finding in the judgment or order detailing the specific relevant factors resulting in the
110 rejection of such arrangement.
111 7. Upon a finding by the court that either parent has refused to exchange information
112 with the other parent, which shall include but not be limited to information concerning the
113 health, education and welfare of the child, the court shall order the parent to comply
114 immediately and to pay the prevailing party a sum equal to the prevailing party's cost
115 associated with obtaining the requested information, which shall include but not be limited to
116 reasonable attorney's fees and court costs.
117 8. As between the parents of a child, no preference may be given to either parent in
118 the awarding of custody because of that parent's age, sex, or financial status, nor because of
119 the age or sex of the child. The court shall not presume that a parent, solely because of his or
120 her sex, is more qualified than the other parent to act as a joint or sole legal or physical
121 custodian for the child.
122 9. Any judgment providing for custody shall include a specific written parenting plan
123 setting forth the terms of such parenting plan arrangements specified in subsection 8 of
124 section 452.310. Such plan may be a parenting plan submitted by the parties pursuant to
125 section 452.310 or, in the absence thereof, a plandetermined by the court, but in all cases,the
126 custody plan approved and ordered by the court shall be in the court's discretion and shall be
127 in the best interest of the child.
128 10. After August 28, 2016, every court order establishing or modifying custody or
129 visitation shall include the following language: "In the event of noncompliance with this
130 order, the aggrieved party may file a verified motion for contempt. If custody, visitation, or
131 third-party custody is denied or interfered with by a parent or third party without good cause,
132 the aggrieved person may file a family access motion with the court stating the specific facts
133 that constitute a violation of the custody provisions of the judgment of dissolution, legal
134 separation, or judgment of paternity. The circuit clerk will provide the aggrieved party with
135 an explanation of the procedures for filing a family access motion and a simple form for use
136 in filing the family access motion. A family access motion does not require the assistance of
137 legal counsel to prepare and file.".

138 11. No court shall adopt any local rule, form, or practice requiring a standardized or
139 default parenting plan for interim, temporary, or permanent orders or judgments.
140 Notwithstanding any other provision of law to the contrary, a court may enter an interim
141 order in a proceeding under this chapter, provided that the interim order shall not contain any
142 provisions about child custody or a parenting schedule or plan without first providing the
143 parties with notice and a hearing, unless the parties otherwise agree.
144 12. Unless a parent has been denied custody rights pursuant to this section or
145 visitation rights under section 452.400, both parents shall have access to records and
146 information pertaining to a minor child including, but not limited to, medical, dental, and
147 school records. If the parent without custody has been granted restricted or supervised
148 visitation because the court has found that the parent with custody or any child has been the
149 victim of domestic violence, as defined in section 455.010, by the parent without custody, the
150 court may order that the reports and records made available pursuant to this subsection not

155 visitation rights under section 452.400, any judgment of dissolution or other applicable court
156 order shall specifically allow both parents access to such records and reports.
157 13. Except as otherwise precluded by state or federal law, if any individual,
158 professional, public or private institution or organization denies access or fails to provide or
159 disclose any and all records and information, including, but not limited to, past and present
160 dental, medical and school records pertaining to a minor child, to either parent upon the
161 written request of such parent, the court shall, upon its finding that the individual,
162 professional, public or private institution or organization denied such request without good
163 cause, order that party to comply immediately with such request and to pay to the prevailing
164 partyallcostsincurred,including,butnotlimitedto,attorney'sfeesandcourtcostsassociated

166 14. Anawardofjointcustodydoesnotprecludeanawardofchildsupportpursuantto

168 contained in section 452.340 and applicable supreme court rules in determining an amount
169 reasonable or necessary for the support of the child.
170 15. If the court finds that domestic violence or abuse as defined in section 455.010
171 has occurred, the court shall make specific findings of fact to show that the custody or
172 visitation arrangement ordered by the court best protects the child and the parent or other
173 family or household member who is the victim of domestic violence, as defined in section
HB 1905 30
174 455.010, and any other children for whom such parent has custodial or visitation rights from
175 any further harm.

2 school board may appoint and remove at pleasure one or more school
3 attendance officers and shall pay them from the public school funds.
4 2. Each attendance officer has the powers of a deputy sheriff in the
5 performance of his duties. He shall investigate the claims of children for
6 exemptions under section 167.031, and report his findings to the person
7 authorized by that section to grant the exemption sought. He shall refer all
8 cases involving an alleged violation of section 167.031 involving a public
9 school to the superintendent of the public school of the district where the child
10 legally resides and all cases involving an alleged violation of section 167.031
11 involving a private, parochial, parish or home school to the prosecuting
12 attorney of the county wherein the child legally resides. When reasonable
13 doubt exists as to the age of any such child he may require a properly attested
14 birth certificate or an affidavit stating the child's age, date of birth, physical
15 characteristics and bearing the signature of the child. He may visit and enter
