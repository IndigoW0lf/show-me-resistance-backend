39 (3) Upon receipt of a complaint alleging a delinquency
40 of the candidate in the filing or payment of any state
41 income taxes, personal property taxes, municipal taxes, real
42 property taxes on the place of residence, as stated on the
43 declaration of candidacy, or if the person is a past or
44 present corporate officer of any fee office that owes any
45 taxes to the state, the department of revenue shall
46 investigate such potential candidate to verify the claim
47 contained in the complaint. If the department of revenue
48 finds a positive affirmation to be false, the department
49 shall contact the secretary of state, or the election
50 official who accepted such candidate's declaration of
51 candidacy, and the potential candidate. The department
SB 1307 3
52 shall notify the candidate of the outstanding tax owed and
53 give the candidate thirty days to remit any such outstanding
54 taxes owed which are not the subject of dispute between the
55 department and the candidate. If the candidate fails to
56 remit such amounts in full within thirty days, the candidate
57 shall be disqualified from participating in the current

59 cycle even if the individual pays all of the outstanding

62 president of the United States after the governor has
63 declared the state to be under a state of actual or
64 threatened invasion of illegal immigrants into this state,
65 and such person has been identified by the governor as being
66 associated with such invasion. The governor shall issue a
67 proclamation not less than eight months prior to the general
68 election identifying any person associated with such
69 invasion. The general assembly, by concurrent resolution
70 approved by two-thirds of the members elected to each
71 chamber, may remove such disability.
1 Section B. Because of the need to ensure that
2 candidates for public office in Missouri have not engaged in
3 threatened or actual invasion of this state, section A of
4 this act is deemed necessary for the immediate preservation
5 of the public health, welfare, peace, and safety, and is
6 hereby declared to be an emergency act within the meaning of
7 the constitution, and section A of this act shall be in full
8 force and effect upon its passage and approval.
