39 dollars payable to the department.
40 2. Within sixty days after the receipt of a completed
41 application, the department shall grant or deny the
42 application in full or in part. The department shall deny
43 the application if:
44 (1) The applicant does not satisfy all of the criteria
45 provided under subsection 1 of this section;
46 (2) The revenue impact assessment submitted with the

52 (3) The department has already approved the maximum

57 for such denial. If the applicant provides any additional
58 information required by the department or otherwise

78 shall certify applications in proportionate percentages
79 based upon the ratio of the amount of capital investment
80 authority requested in an application to the total amount of
81 capital investment authority requested in all applications.

8 of the applicant receiving notice of certification, the
9 rural fund shall issue the capital investment to, and
10 receive cash in the amount of the certified amount from, a
11 rural investor. At least ten percent of the rural
12 investor's capital investment shall be composed of affiliate
13 capital. The rural fund shall provide the department with
14 evidence of the receipt of the cash investment within ninety-
15 five days of the applicant receiving notice of
16 certification. Such evidence shall include details of the
17 third party capital raised, including from any leverage
18 source.
19 2. If the rural fund does not receive the cash
20 investment and issue the capital investment within such time
21 period following receipt of the certification notice, the
22 certification shall lapse and the rural fund shall not issue
23 the capital investment without reapplying to the department
24 for certification. Lapsed certifications shall revert to
25 the department and shall be reissued pro rata to applicants
26 whose capital investment allocations were reduced during the
27 immediately preceding application cycle in accordance with
28 the application process provided under subsection 4 of
29 section 620.3510. Any lapsed certification not reissued
30 within the same calendar year as the lapsed certification
31 was issued shall not be reissued.
SB 802 11
32 3. A rural fund, before making a qualified investment,
33 may request from the department a written opinion as to
34 whether the business in which it proposes to invest is an
35 eligible business. Such request shall be on a form
36 developed by the department to be completed by the eligible
37 business and the rural fund. If the department fails to
38 notify the rural fund of its determination by the twentieth
39 business day following its receipt of the completed form and
40 all information necessary to form its opinion, the business
41 in which the rural fund proposes to invest shall be deemed
42 an eligible business.
1 620.3520. 1. Upon making a capital investment in a
2 rural fund, a rural investor shall have a vested right to
3 earn a tax credit that will be issued by the department that
4 may be used against such entity's state tax liability that
5 may be utilized on each credit allowance date of such
6 capital investment in an amount equal to the applicable
7 percentage for such credit allowance date multiplied by the
8 purchase price paid to the rural fund for the capital
9 investment. The amount of the credit claimed by a rural
10 investor shall not exceed the amount of such entity's state
11 tax liability for the tax year for which the credit is
12 claimed. Any amount of credit that a rural investor is
13 prohibited from claiming in a taxable year as a result of
14 this section may be carried forward for use in any of the
15 five subsequent taxable years, and shall not be carried back
16 to prior taxable years. A rural investor claiming a credit
17 under the provisions of sections 620.3500 to 620.3530 shall
18 not incur any additional tax that may arise as a result of
19 claiming such credit.
20 2. No credit claimed under the provisions of sections
21 620.3500 to 620.3530 shall be refundable or sellable on the
SB 802 12
22 open market. Credits earned by or allocated to a
23 partnership, limited liability company, or S-corporation may
24 be allocated to the partners, members, or shareholders of
25 such entity for their direct use in accordance with the
26 provisions of any agreement among such partners, members, or
27 shareholders, and a rural fund shall notify the department
28 of the names of the entities that are eligible to utilize
29 credits pursuant to an allocation of credits or a change in
30 allocation of credits, or due to a transfer of a capital
31 investment upon such allocation, change, or transfer. Such
32 allocation shall not be considered a sale for the purposes
33 of this section.
34 3. The department may recapture credits from a
35 taxpayer that claimed a credit authorized under this section
36 if:
37 (1) The rural fund does not invest sixty percent of
38 its capital investment authority in qualified investments in
39 this state within two years of the credit allowance date,
40 and one hundred percent of its capital investment authority
41 in qualified investments in this state within three years of
42 the credit allowance date, provided that at least seventy
43 percent of such initial qualified investments shall be made
44 in eligible businesses located in rural areas or eligible
45 businesses that are also agribusinesses. In no event shall
46 more than thirty percent of such initial qualified
47 investments be made in eligible businesses located outside
48 of a rural area;
49 (2) The rural fund fails to maintain qualified
50 investments equal to ninety percent of its capital
51 investment authority from the third until the sixth credit
52 allowance date, with seventy percent of such investments
53 maintained in eligible businesses located in rural areas or
SB 802 13
54 eligible businesses that are also agribusinesses, provided
55 that in no event shall more than thirty percent of such
56 qualified investments be made in eligible businesses located
57 outside of a rural area. For each year the rural fund fails
58 to maintain such investments, the department may recapture
59 an amount of such year's allowed credits equal to the
60 percentage difference between ninety percent of a rural
61 fund's capital investment authority and the actual amount of
62 qualified investments maintained for such year. For the
63 purposes of this subdivision, a qualified investment is
64 considered maintained even if the qualified investment was
65 sold or repaid so long as the rural fund reinvests an amount
66 equal to the capital returned or recovered by the rural fund
67 from the original investment, exclusive of any profits
68 realized, in other qualified investments in this state
69 within twelve months of the receipt of such capital.
70 Amounts received periodically by a rural fund shall be
71 treated as continually invested in qualified investments if
72 the amounts are reinvested in one or more qualified
73 investments by the end of the following calendar year. A
74 rural fund shall not be required to reinvest capital
75 returned from qualified investments after the fifth credit
76 allowance date, and such qualified investments shall be
77 considered held continuously by the rural fund through the
78 sixth credit allowance date;
79 (3) The rural fund, before exiting the program in
80 accordance with sections 620.3500 to 620.3530 or prior to
81 thirty days after the sixth credit allowance date, whichever
82 is earlier, makes a distribution or payment that results in
83 the rural fund having less than one hundred percent of its
84 capital investment authority invested in qualified
85 investments in this state or held in cash or other
SB 802 14
86 marketable securities, provided a rural fund shall be
87 permitted to make distributions in amounts necessary for the
88 principal and interest payments due to the leverage source;
89 or
90 (4) The rural fund violates the provisions of section
91 620.3525, in which case the department may recapture an
92 amount equal to the amount of a rural fund's capital
93 investment authority found to be in violation of such
94 provisions.
95 For the purposes of meeting and maintaining the objectives
96 established for investment in subdivisions (1) and (2) of
97 this subsection, a rural fund's qualified investments shall
98 be multiplied by a factor of one and a quarter in counties
99 with less than thirty thousand in population and more than
100 thirteen thousand in population and shall be multiplied by a
101 factor of one and a half in counties with a population of
102 thirteen thousand or less according to the most recent
103 decennial census.
104 4. No recapture shall occur until the rural fund has
105 been given notice of noncompliance and afforded six months
106 from the date of such notice to cure the noncompliance.
1 620.3525. No eligible business that receives a
2 qualified investment under the provisions of sections
3 620.3500 to 620.3530, or any affiliates of such eligible
4 businesses, shall directly or indirectly:
5 (1) Own or have the right to acquire an ownership
6 interest in a rural fund or member or affiliate of a rural
7 fund, including, but not limited to, a holder of a capital
8 investment issued by the rural fund; or
9 (2) Loan to or invest in a rural fund or member or
10 affiliate of a rural fund, including, but not limited to, a
SB 802 15
11 holder of a capital investment issued by a rural fund, where
12 the proceeds of such loan or investment are directly or
13 indirectly used to fund or refinance the purchase of a
14 capital investment under sections 620.3500 to 620.3530.
1 620.3530. 1. Rural funds shall submit a report to the
2 department within the first fifteen business days after the
3 second and third credit allowance date. The report
4 following the second credit allowance date shall provide
5 documentation as to the investment of sixty percent of the
6 purchase price of such capital investment in qualified
7 investments. The report following the third credit
8 allowance date shall provide documentation as to the
9 investment of one hundred percent of the purchase price of
10 such capital investment in qualified investments. For all
11 subsequent years, rural funds shall submit an annual report
12 to the department within ninety days of the beginning of the
13 calendar year during the compliance period. Unless
14 previously reported pursuant to this subsection, such
15 reports shall also include:
16 (1) The name and location of each eligible business
17 receiving a qualified investment;
18 (2) Bank statements of such rural fund evidencing each
19 qualified investment;
20 (3) A copy of the written opinion of the department,
21 as provided in subsection 3 of section 620.3515, or evidence
22 that such business was an eligible business at the time of
23 such qualified investment, as applicable;
24 (4) The total number of new jobs, maintained jobs, new
25 payroll, maintained payroll, new revenue, and maintained
26 revenue by each eligible business receiving a qualified
27 investment from a rural fund;
SB 802 16

29 local tax revenue actually generated and projected to be
30 generated from a rural fund's qualified investments,
31 prepared by a nationally-recognized, third-party,
32 independent firm engaged by the rural fund, in agreement
33 with the department, that uses a dynamic forecasting model
34 that projects the direct and indirect state and local tax
35 revenue for a period of not less than ten years; and
36 (6) Such other information as required by the
37 department.
38 2. The program authorized pursuant to sections
39 620.3500 to 620.3530 shall be considered a business
40 recruitment tax credit under subdivision (4) of subsection 2
41 of section 135.800, and any rural fund approved under this
42 program shall be subject to the provisions of sections
43 135.800 to 135.830.
44 3. On or after the sixth anniversary of the initial
45 credit allowance date, a rural fund may apply to the
46 department to exit the program and no longer be subject to
47 regulation under the provisions of sections 620.3500 to
48 620.3530. Such request shall be on a form developed by the
49 department to be completed by the rural fund. The
50 department shall respond to the exit application within
51 thirty days of receipt of the completed form. In evaluating
52 the exit application, the fact that no credits have been
53 recaptured and that the rural fund has not received a notice
54 of recapture that has not been cured pursuant to subsection
55 4 of section 620.3520 shall be sufficient evidence to prove
56 that the rural fund is eligible for exit. The department
57 shall not unreasonably deny, delay, or withhold its
58 determination of an exit application submitted under this
SB 802 17
59 subsection. If the exit application is denied, the notice
60 shall include the reasons for such determination.
61 4. Upon exit from the program in accordance with
62 subsection 3 of this section, in the event the state sharing
