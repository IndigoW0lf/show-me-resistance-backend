88 energy produced or consumed during the billing period in accordance with normal metering
89 practices for customers in the same rate class, either by employing a single, bidirectional
90 meter that measures the amount of electrical energy produced and consumed, or by
HB 1854 4
91 employingmultiplemetersthatseparatelymeasurethecustomer-generator'sconsumptionand
92 production of electricity;
93 (2) If the electricity supplied by the supplier exceeds the electricity generated by the
94 customer-generator during a billing period, the customer-generator shall be billed for the net
95 electricity supplied by the retail electric supplier in accordance with normal practices for
96 customers in the same rate class;
97 (3) If the electricity generated by the customer-generator exceeds the electricity
98 supplied by the supplier during a billing period, the customer-generator shall be billed for the
99 appropriate customer and demand charges for that billing period in accordance with
100 subsection 3 of this section and shall be credited an amount at least equal to the avoided fuel
101 cost of the excess kilowatt-hours generated during the billing period, with this credit applied
102 to the following billing period;
103 (4) Any credits granted by this subsection shall expire without any compensation at
104 the earlier of either twelve months after their issuance or when the customer-generator
105 disconnects service or terminates the net metering relationship with the supplier;
106 (5) For any rural electric cooperative under chapter 394, or any municipally owned
107 utility, upon agreement of the wholesale generator supplying electric energy to the retail
108 electric supplier, at the option of the retail electric supplier, the credit to the customer-
109 generator may be provided by the wholesale generator.
