4443S.01I KRISTINA MARTIN, Secretary
JOINT RESOLUTION
Submitting to the qualified voters of Missouri, an amendment repealing sections 3, 5, 7, 8, 9, 16,
18, 20, 20(a), 20(b), 31, and 32 of article III of the Constitution of Missouri, and
adopting eleven new sections in lieu thereof relating to the general assembly.
Be it resolved by the Senate, the House of Representatives concurring therein:
1 That at the next general election to be held in the
2 state of Missouri, on Tuesday next following the first Monday
3 in November, 2024, or at a special election to be called by
4 the governor for that purpose, there is hereby submitted to
5 the qualified voters of this state, for adoption or
6 rejection, the following amendment to article III of the
7 Constitution of the state of Missouri:
1 Section A. Sections 3, 5, 7, 8, 9, 16, 18, 20, 20(a),
2 20(b), 31, and 32, article III, Constitution of Missouri, are
3 repealed and eleven new sections adopted in lieu thereof, to be
4 known as sections 3, 5, 7, 8, 9, 16, 18, 20, 20(a), 31, and 32,
5 to read as follows:
1 Section 3. (a) The house of representatives shall
2 consist of [one hundred sixty-three] members elected at each
3 general election and redistricted as provided in this
4 section.
5 (b) The [house] general assembly independent
6 bipartisan citizens commission shall redistrict each house
7 of the [house of representatives] general assembly using the
8 following methods, listed in order of priority:
EXPLANATION-Matter enclosed in bold-faced brackets [thus] in this bill is not enacted
and is intended to be omitted in the law.
SJR 68 2
9 (1) Districts shall be as nearly equal as practicable
10 in population, and shall be drawn on the basis of one
11 person, one vote. Districts are as nearly equal as
12 practicable in population if no district deviates by more
13 than one percent from the ideal population of the district,
14 as measured by dividing the number of districts into the
15 statewide population data being used, except that a district
16 may deviate by up to three percent if necessary to follow
17 political subdivision lines consistent with subdivision (4)
18 of this subsection;
19 (2) Districts shall be established in a manner so as
20 to comply with all requirements of the United States
21 Constitution and applicable federal laws, including, but not
22 limited to, the Voting Rights Act of 1965 (as amended). The
23 following principles shall take precedence over any other
24 part of this constitution: no district shall be drawn in a
25 manner which results in a denial or abridgment of the right
26 of any citizen of the United States to vote on account of
27 race or color; and no district shall be drawn such that
28 members of any community of citizens protected by the
29 preceding clause have less opportunity than other members of
30 the electorate to participate in the political process and
31 to elect representatives of their choice;
32 (3) Subject to the requirements of subdivisions (1)
33 and (2) of this subsection, districts shall be composed of
34 contiguous territory as compact as may be. Areas which meet
35 only at the points of adjoining corners are not contiguous.
36 In general, compact districts are those which are square,
37 rectangular, or hexagonal in shape to the extent permitted
38 by natural or political boundaries;
39 (4) To the extent consistent with subdivisions (1) to
40 (3) of this subsection, communities shall be preserved.
SJR 68 3
41 Districts shall satisfy this requirement if district lines
42 follow political subdivision lines to the extent possible,
43 using the following criteria, in order of priority. First,
44 each county shall wholly contain as many districts as its
45 population allows. Second, if a county wholly contains one
46 or more districts, the remaining population shall be wholly
47 joined in a single district made up of population from
48 outside the county. If a county does not wholly contain a
49 district, then no more than two segments of a county shall
50 be combined with an adjoining county. Third, split counties
51 and county segments, defined as any part of the county that
52 is in a district not wholly within that county, shall each
53 be as few as possible. Fourth, as few municipal lines shall
54 be crossed as possible. Fifth, no house of representatives
55 district shall cross a senate district line or be in more
56 than one senate district;
57 (5) Districts shall be drawn in a manner that achieves
58 both partisan fairness and, secondarily, competitiveness,
59 but the standards established by subdivisions (1) to (4) of
60 this subsection shall take precedence over partisan fairness
61 and competitiveness. "Partisan fairness" means that parties
62 shall be able to translate their popular support into
63 legislative representation with approximately equal
64 efficiency. "Competitiveness" means that parties'
65 legislative representation shall be substantially and
66 similarly responsive to shifts in the electorate's
67 preferences.
68 To this end, the average electoral performance of the
69 two political parties receiving the most votes in the three
70 preceding general elections for governor, for United States
71 Senate, and for President of the United States shall be
72 calculated. This index shall be defined as the total votes
SJR 68 4
73 received by each party in the three preceding general
74 elections for governor, for United States Senate, and for
75 President of the United States, divided by the total votes
76 cast for both parties in these elections. Using this index,
77 the total number of wasted votes for each party, summing
78 across all of the districts in the plan shall be
79 calculated. "Wasted votes" are votes cast for a losing
80 candidate or for a winning candidate in excess of the
81 threshold needed for victory. In any redistricting plan and
82 map of the proposed districts, the difference between the
83 two parties' total wasted votes, divided by the total votes
84 cast for the two parties, shall not exceed fifteen percent.
85 To promote competitiveness, the electoral performance
86 index shall be used to simulate elections in which the
87 hypothetical statewide vote shifts by one percent, two
88 percent, three percent, four percent, and five percent in
89 favor of each party. The vote in each individual district
90 shall be assumed to shift by the same amount as the
91 statewide vote. In each of these simulated elections, the
92 difference between the two parties' total wasted votes,
93 divided by the total votes cast for the two parties, shall
94 not exceed fifteen percent.
95 (c) Within sixty days after the adoption of this
96 section and within sixty days after the population of this
97 state is reported to the President for each decennial census
98 of the United States or, in the event that a redistricting
99 plan has been invalidated by a court of competent
100 jurisdiction, within sixty days that such a ruling has been
101 made, the state committee and the congressional district
102 committees of each of the two political parties casting the
103 highest vote for governor at the last preceding general
104 election shall meet and the members of each committee shall
SJR 68 5
105 nominate, by a majority vote of the elected members of the
106 committee present, provided that a majority of the elected
107 members is present, members of their party, residents in
108 that district, in the case of a congressional district
109 committee, as nominees for the [house] general assembly
110 independent bipartisan citizens commission. Each member of
111 the committee shall be entitled to only one vote
112 notwithstanding the number of offices or titles that the
113 member may have or the manner in which the member became a
114 member of the committee. No party shall select more than
115 one nominee from any one state legislative district. The
116 congressional district committees shall each submit to the
117 governor their list of two elected nominees. The state
118 committees shall each submit to the governor their list of
119 five elected nominees. Within thirty days thereafter, the
120 governor shall appoint a [house] general assembly
121 independent bipartisan citizens commission consisting of one
122 nominee from each list submitted by each congressional
123 district committee and two nominees from each list submitted
124 by each state committee to redistrict [the state into one
125 hundred and sixty-three representative districts] each house
126 of the general assembly and to establish the numbers and
127 boundaries of said districts. [No person shall be appointed
128 to both the house independent bipartisan citizens commission
129 and the senate independent bipartisan citizens commission
130 during the same redistricting cycle.]
131 If any committee fails to submit a list within such
132 time, the governor shall appoint a member of his or her own
133 choice from the political party of the committee failing to
134 submit a list, provided that in the case of a congressional
135 district committee failing to submit a list, the person
SJR 68 6
136 appointed to the commission by the governor shall reside in
137 the congressional district of such committee.
138 Members of the commission shall be disqualified from
139 holding office as members of the general assembly for four
140 years following the date of the filing by the commission of
141 its final redistricting plan.
142 For the purposes of this Article, the term
143 congressional district committee or congressional district
144 refers to the congressional district committee or the
145 congressional district from which a congressman was last
146 elected, or, in the event members of congress from this
147 state have been elected at large, the term congressional
148 district committee refers to those persons who last served
149 as the congressional district committee for those districts
150 from which congressmen were last elected, and the term
151 congressional district refers to those districts from which
152 congressmen were last elected. Any action pursuant to this
153 section by the congressional district committee shall take
154 place only at duly called meetings, shall be recorded in
155 their official minutes and only members present in person
156 shall be permitted to vote.
157 (d) The commissioners so selected shall, on the
158 fifteenth day, excluding Sundays and state holidays, after
159 all members have been appointed, meet in the capitol
160 building and proceed to organize by electing from their
161 number a chairman, vice chairman and secretary. The
162 commission shall adopt an agenda establishing at least three
163 hearing dates on which hearings open to the public shall be
164 held to hear objections or testimony from interested
165 persons. A copy of the agenda shall be filed with the clerk
166 of the house of representatives and the secretary of senate
167 within twenty-four hours after its adoption. Executive
SJR 68 7
168 meetings may be scheduled and held as often as the
169 commission deems advisable.
170 (e) Not later than five months after the appointment
171 of the commission, the commission shall file with the
172 secretary of state a tentative redistricting plan and map of
173 the proposed districts and during the ensuing fifteen days
174 shall hold such public hearings as may be necessary to hear
175 objections or testimony of interested persons. The
176 commission shall make public the tentative redistricting
177 plan and map of the proposed districts, as well as all

179 plan and map.
180 (f) Not later than six months after the appointment of
181 the commission, the commission shall file with the secretary
182 of state a final statement of the numbers and the boundaries
183 of the districts together with a map of the districts, and
184 no statement shall be valid unless approved by at least
185 seven-tenths of the members.
186 (g) After the final statement is filed, members of
187 [the house of representatives] each house of the general
188 assembly shall be elected according to such districts until
189 a new redistricting plan is made as provided in this
190 section[, except that if the final statement is not filed
191 within six months of the time fixed for the appointment of
192 the commission, the commission shall stand discharged and
193 the house of representatives shall be redistricted using the
194 same methods and criteria as described in subsection (b) of

196 among the judges of the appellate courts of the state of
197 Missouri by the state supreme court, a majority of whom
198 shall sign and file its redistricting plan and map with the

222 Only an eligible Missouri voter who sustains an individual
223 injury by virtue of residing in a district that exhibits the
224 alleged violation, and whose injury is remedied by a
225 differently drawn district, shall have standing. If the
226 court renders a judgment in which it finds that a completed
227 redistricting plan exhibits the alleged violation, its
228 judgment shall adjust only those districts, and only those
229 parts of district boundaries, necessary to bring the map
230 into compliance. The supreme court shall have exclusive
SJR 68 9
231 appellate jurisdiction upon the filing of a notice of appeal
232 within ten days after the judgment has become final.]
