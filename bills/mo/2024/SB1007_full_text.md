3 purposes.] 1. Except as otherwise provided in the terms of
4 a trust or sections 469.399 to 469.487, sections 469.399 to
5 469.487 apply to:
6 (1) A trust or estate; and
7 (2) A life estate or other term interest in which the
8 interest of one or more persons will be succeeded by the

10 2. Except as otherwise provided in the terms of a
11 trust or sections 469.399 to 469.487, sections 469.399 to
12 469.487 apply when this state is the principal place of
13 administration of a trust or estate or the situs of property
14 that is not held in a trust or estate and is subject to a

21 469.487 to any matter within the scope of sections 469.399
22 to 469.487 involving the trust.
1 469.403. 1. [In allocating receipts and disbursements
2 to or between principal and income, and with respect to any
3 matter within the scope of] In making an allocation or

6 (1) [Shall] Act in good faith, based on what is fair
7 and reasonable to all beneficiaries;
8 (2) Administer a trust or estate [under] impartially,
9 except to the extent the terms of the trust manifest an
10 intent that the fiduciary shall or [the will] may favor one
11 or more beneficiaries;
12 (3) Administer the trust or estate in accordance with
13 the terms of the trust, even if there is a different
14 provision in sections [469.401] 469.399 to [469.467]
15 469.487; and
16 [(2) May] (4) Administer [a] the trust or estate [by
17 exercising] in accordance with sections 469.399 to 469.487,
18 except to the extent the terms of the trust provide
19 otherwise or authorize the fiduciary to determine otherwise.
20 2. A fiduciary's allocation, determination, or
21 exercise of discretion pursuant to sections 469.399 to
22 409.487 is presumed to be fair and reasonable to all
23 beneficiaries. A fiduciary may exercise a discretionary
24 power of administration given to the fiduciary by the terms
25 of the trust [or the will, even if the], and an exercise of
26 the power that produces a result different from a result
27 required or permitted by sections [469.401] 469.399 to
28 [469.467;] 469.487 does not create an inference that the
29 fiduciary abused the fiduciary's discretion.

36 [fiduciary a discretionary power of administration] receipt
37 between income and principal; and
38 [(4) Shall add a receipt or] (2) Charge a
39 disbursement to principal, to the extent [that the terms of
40 the trust and sections 469.401 to 469.467 do not provide a
41 rule for allocating the receipt or disbursement to or
42 between principal and income.
43 2. In exercising the power to adjust pursuant to
44 section 469.405 or a discretionary power of administration
45 regarding a matter within the scope of sections 469.401 to
46 469.467, whether granted by the terms of a trust, a will, or
47 sections 469.401 to 469.467, a fiduciary shall administer a
48 trust or estate impartially, based on what is fair and
49 reasonable to all of the beneficiaries, except to the extent
50 that the terms of the trust or the will clearly manifest an
51 intent that the fiduciary shall or may favor one or more of
52 the beneficiaries. A determination in accordance with
53 sections 469.401 to 469.467 is presumed to be fair and
54 reasonable to all of the beneficiaries] neither the terms of
55 the trust nor sections 469.399 to 469.487 allocate the
56 disbursement between income and principal.
57 4. A fiduciary may exercise the power to adjust under
58 section 469.405, convert an income trust to a unitrust under
59 subdivision (1) of subsection 1 of section 469.475, change
60 the percentage or method used to calculate a unitrust amount
61 under subdivision (2) of subsection 1 of section 469.475, or
62 convert a unitrust to an income trust under subdivision (3)
63 of subsection 1 of section 469.475, if the fiduciary
64 determines the exercise of the power will assist the
65 fiduciary to administer the trust or estate impartially.
66 5. Factors the fiduciary shall consider in making the
67 determination under subsection 4 of this section include:
SB 1007 18
68 (1) The terms of the trust;
69 (2) The nature, distribution standards, and expected
70 duration of the trust;
71 (3) The effect of the allocation rules, including
72 specific adjustments between income and principal, under
73 sections 407.413 to 407.461;
74 (4) The desirability of liquidity and regularity of
75 income;
76 (5) The desirability of the preservation and
77 appreciation of principal;
78 (6) The extent to which an asset is used or may be
79 used by a beneficiary;
80 (7) The increase or decrease in the value of principal
81 assets, reasonably determined by the fiduciary;
82 (8) Whether and to what extent the terms of the trust
83 give the fiduciary power to accumulate income or invade
84 principal or prohibit the fiduciary from accumulating income
85 or invading principal;
86 (9) The extent to which the fiduciary has accumulated
87 income or invaded principal in preceding accounting periods;
88 (10) The effect of current and reasonably expected
89 economic conditions; and
90 (11) The reasonably expected tax consequences of the
91 exercise of the power.
1 469.404. 1. As used in this section, the term
2 "fiduciary decision" means:
3 (1) A fiduciary's allocation between income and
4 principal or other determination regarding income and
5 principal required or authorized by the terms of the trust
6 or sections 469.399 to 469.487;
7 (2) The fiduciary's exercise or nonexercise of a
8 discretionary power regarding income and principal granted
SB 1007 19
9 by the terms of the trust or sections 469.399 to 469.487,
10 including the power to adjust under section 469.405, convert
11 an income trust to a unitrust under subdivision (1) of
12 subsection 1 of section 469.475, change the percentage or
13 method used to calculate a unitrust amount under subdivision
14 (2) of subsection 1 of section 469.475, or convert a
15 unitrust to an income trust under subdivision (3) of
16 subsection 1 of section 469.475; or
17 (3) The fiduciary's implementation of a decision
18 described in subdivision (1) or (2) of this subsection.
19 2. The court shall not order a fiduciary to change a
20 fiduciary decision unless the court determines that the
21 fiduciary decision was an abuse of the fiduciary's
22 discretion.
23 3. If the court determines that a fiduciary decision
24 was an abuse of the fiduciary's discretion, the court may
25 order a remedy authorized by law, including under section
26 456.10-1001. To place the beneficiaries in the positions
27 the beneficiaries would have occupied if there had not been
28 an abuse of the fiduciary's discretion, the court may order:
29 (1) The fiduciary to exercise or refrain from
30 exercising the power to adjust under section 469.405;
31 (2) The fiduciary to exercise or refrain from
32 exercising the power to convert an income trust to a
33 unitrust under subdivision (1) of subsection 1 of section

35 unitrust amount under subdivision (2) of subsection 1 of
36 section 469.475, or convert a unitrust to an income trust
37 under subdivision (3) of subsection 1 of section 469.475;
38 (3) The fiduciary to distribute an amount to a
39 beneficiary;
SB 1007 20
40 (4) A beneficiary to return some or all of a
41 distribution; or
42 (5) The fiduciary to withhold an amount from one or
43 more future distributions to a beneficiary.
44 4. On petition by a fiduciary for instruction, the
45 court may determine whether a proposed fiduciary decision
46 will result in an abuse of the fiduciary's discretion. If
47 the petition describes the proposed decision, contains
48 sufficient information to inform the beneficiary of the
49 reasons for making the proposed decision and the facts on
50 which the fiduciary relies, and explains how the beneficiary
51 will be affected by the proposed decision, a beneficiary
52 that opposes the proposed decision has the burden to
53 establish that it will result in an abuse of the fiduciary's
54 discretion.
1 469.405. 1. [A trustee may adjust between principal
2 and income to the extent the trustee considers necessary if
3 the trustee invests and manages trust assets as a prudent
4 investor, the terms of the trust describe the amount that
5 may or shall be distributed to a beneficiary by referring to
6 the trust's income, and the trustee determines, after
7 applying subsection 1 of section 469.403, that the trustee
8 is unable to comply with subsection 2 of section 469.403.]
9 Except as otherwise provided in the terms of a trust or this
10 section, a fiduciary, in a record, without court approval,
11 may adjust between income and principal if the fiduciary
12 determines the exercise of the power to adjust will assist
13 the fiduciary to administer the trust or estate impartially.
14 2. This section does not create a duty to exercise or
15 consider the power to adjust under subsection 1 of this
16 section or to inform a beneficiary about the applicability
17 of this section.
SB 1007 21
18 3. A fiduciary that in good faith exercises or fails
19 to exercise the power to adjust under subsection 1 of this
20 section is not liable to a person affected by the exercise
21 or failure to exercise.
22 [2.] 4. In deciding whether and to what extent to
23 exercise the power [conferred by] to adjust under subsection
24 1 of this section, a [trustee] fiduciary shall consider all
25 factors the fiduciary considers relevant [to the trust and
26 its beneficiaries], including [the following] relevant
27 factors [to the extent relevant:] in subsection 5 of section
28 469.403 and the application of sections 469.423, 469.435,

45 sections 469.401 to 469.467, other than this section, and
46 the increase or decrease in the value of the principal
47 assets, which the trustee may estimate as to assets for
48 which market values are not readily available;
SB 1007 22
49 (7) Whether and to what extent the terms of the trust
50 give the trustee the power to invade principal or accumulate
51 income, or prohibit the trustee from invading principal or
52 accumulating income, and the extent to which the trustee has
53 exercised a power from time to time to invade principal or
54 accumulate income;
55 (8) The actual and anticipated effect of economic
56 conditions on principal and income and effects of inflation
57 and deflation; and
58 (9) The anticipated tax consequences of an adjustment.
59 3.] 5. A [trustee may] fiduciary shall not exercise
60 the power under subsection 1 of this section to make an
61 adjustment or under section 469.435 to make a determination
62 that an allocation is insubstantial if:
63 (1) [That diminishes the income interest in a trust
64 which requires all of the income to be paid at least

69 interest in a trust to which a person transfers property
70 with the intent to qualify for a gift tax exclusion;

83 would reduce an amount that is permanently set aside for a
84 charitable [purposes] purpose under [a will or] the terms of
85 [a] the trust [to the extent that the existence of the power
86 to adjust would change the character of the amount], unless
87 both income and principal are set aside for [federal income,
88 gift or estate tax purposes] the charitable purpose;
89 [(5) If ] (4) Possessing or exercising the power [to
90 make an adjustment causes an individual] would cause a
91 person to be treated as the owner of all or part of the
92 trust for [income tax purposes, and the individual would not
93 be treated as the owner if the trustee did not possess the
94 power to make an adjustment] federal income tax purposes;

98 purposes] in the gross estate of an individual [who has] for
99 federal estate tax purposes;
100 (6) Possessing or exercising the power [to remove or

138 power conferred by subsection 1 of this section, or may

142 power will] or delegate to a cofiduciary the power to adjust
143 under subsection 1 of this section if the fiduciary
SB 1007 25
144 determines that the fiduciary's possession or exercise of
145 the power will or may:
146 (1) Cause a result described in subdivisions (1) to
147 (6) or subdivision (8) of subsection [3] 5 of this section

92 [that] the decedent's will, the terms of the trust, or
93 applicable law requires the fiduciary to make the payment

31 undistributed principal assets shall be calculated] :
32 (a) On the [basis of the] aggregate value of [those]

1 [469.409. 1. Any claim for breach of a
2 trustee's duty to impartially administer a trust
3 related, directly or indirectly, to an
4 adjustment made by a fiduciary to the allocation
5 between principal and income pursuant to
6 subsection 1 of section 469.405 or any
SB 1007 80
7 allocation made by the fiduciary pursuant to any
8 authority or discretion specified in subsection
9 1 of section 469.403, unless previously barred
10 by adjudication, consent or other limitation,
11 shall be barred as provided in this section.
12 (1) Any such claim brought by a qualified
13 beneficiary is barred if not asserted in a
14 judicial proceeding commenced within two years
15 after the trustee has sent a report to that
16 qualified beneficiary that adequately discloses
17 the facts constituting the claim.
18 (2) Any such claim brought by a
19 beneficiary (other than a qualified beneficiary)
20 with any interest whatsoever in the trust, no
21 matter how remote or contingent, or whether or
22 not the beneficiary is ascertainable or has the
23 capacity to contract, is barred if not asserted
24 in a judicial proceeding commenced within two
25 years after the first to occur of:
26 (a) The date the trustee sent a report to
27 all qualified beneficiaries that adequately
28 discloses the facts constituting the claim; or
29 (b) The date the trustee sent a report to
30 a person that represents the beneficiary under
31 the provisions of subdivision (2) of subsection
32 2 of this section.
33 2. For purposes of this section the
34 following rules shall apply:
35 (1) A report adequately discloses the
36 facts constituting a claim if it provides
37 sufficient information so that the beneficiary
38 should know of the claim or reasonably should
39 have inquired into its existence;
40 (2) Section 469.402 shall apply in
41 determining whether a beneficiary (including a
42 qualified beneficiary) has received notice for
43 purposes of this section;
44 (3) The determination of the identity of
45 all qualified beneficiaries shall be made on the
46 date the report is deemed to have been sent; and
47 (4) This section does not preclude an
48 action to recover for fraud or misrepresentation
49 related to the report.]
1 [469.411. 1. (1) If the provisions of
2 this section apply to a trust, the unitrust
3 amount determined for each accounting year of
4 the trust shall be a percentage between three
5 and five percent of the average net fair market
6 value of the trust, as of the first day of the
7 trust's current accounting year. The percentage
8 applicable to a trust shall be that percentage
9 specified by the terms of the governing
10 instrument or by the election made in accordance
11 with subdivision (2) of subsection 5 of this
12 section.
SB 1007 81
13 (2) The unitrust amount for the current
14 accounting year computed pursuant to this
15 section shall be proportionately reduced for any
16 distributions, in whole or in part, other than
17 distributions of the unitrust amount, and for
18 any payments of expenses, including debts,
19 disbursements and taxes, from the trust within a
20 current accounting year that the trustee
21 determines to be material and substantial, and
22 shall be proportionately increased for the
23 receipt, other than a receipt that represents a
24 return on investment, of any additional property
25 into the trust within a current accounting year.
26 (3) For purposes of this section, the net
27 fair market values of the assets held in the
28 trust on the first business day of a prior
29 accounting quarter shall be adjusted to reflect
30 any reduction, in the case of a distribution or
31 payment, or increase, in the case of a receipt,
32 for the prior accounting year pursuant to
33 subdivision (1) of this subsection, as if the
34 distribution, payment or receipt had occurred on
35 the first day of the prior accounting year.
36 (4) In the case of a short accounting
37 period, the trustee shall prorate the unitrust
38 amount on a daily basis.
39 (5) In the case where the net fair market
40 value of an asset held in the trust has been
41 incorrectly determined in any quarter, the
42 unitrust amount shall be increased in the case
43 of an undervaluation, or be decreased in the
44 case of an overvaluation, by an amount equal to
45 the difference between the unitrust amount
46 determined based on the correct valuation of the
47 asset and the unitrust amount originally
48 determined.
49 2. As used in this section, the following
50 terms mean:
51 (1) "Average net fair market value", a
52 rolling average of the fair market value of the
53 assets held in the trust on the first business
54 day of the lessor of the number of accounting
55 quarters of the trust from the date of inception
56 of the trust to the determination of the trust's
57 average net fair market value, or twelve
58 accounting quarters of the trust, regardless of
59 whether this section applied to the
60 ascertainment of net income for all valuation
61 quarters;
62 (2) "Current accounting year", the
63 accounting period of the trust for which the
64 unitrust amount is being determined.
65 3. In determining the average net fair
66 market value of the assets held in the trust,
67 there shall not be included the value of:
68 (1) Any residential property or any
69 tangible personal property that, as of the first
SB 1007 82
70 business day of the current valuation year, one
71 or more income beneficiaries of the trust have
72 or had the right to occupy, or have or had the
73 right to possess or control, other than in a
74 capacity as trustee, and instead the right of
75 occupancy or the right to possession or control
76 shall be deemed to be the unitrust amount with
77 respect to the residential property or the
78 tangible personal property; or
79 (2) Any asset specifically given to a
80 beneficiary under the terms of the trust and the
81 return on investment on that asset, which return
82 on investment shall be distributable to the
83 beneficiary.
84 4. In determining the average net fair
85 market value of the assets held in the trust
86 pursuant to subsection 1 of this section, the
87 trustee shall, not less often than annually,
88 determine the fair market value of each asset of
89 the trust that consists primarily of real
90 property or other property that is not traded on
91 a regular basis in an active market by appraisal
92 or other reasonable method or estimate, and that
93 determination, if made reasonably and in good
94 faith, shall be conclusive as to all persons
95 interested in the trust. Any claim based on a
96 determination made pursuant to this subsection
97 shall be barred if not asserted in a judicial
98 proceeding brought by any beneficiary with any
99 interest whatsoever in the trust within two
100 years after the trustee has sent a report to all
101 qualified beneficiaries that adequately
102 discloses the facts constituting the claim. The
103 rules set forth in subsection 2 of section
104 469.409 shall apply to the barring of claims
105 pursuant to this subsection.
106 5. This section shall apply to the
107 following trusts:
108 (1) Any trust created after August 28,
109 2001, with respect to which the terms of the
110 trust clearly manifest an intent that this
111 section apply;
112 (2) Any trust created under an instrument
113 that became irrevocable on, before, or after
114 August 28, 2001, if the trustee, in the
115 trustee's discretion, elects to have this
116 section apply unless the instrument creating the
117 trust specifically prohibits an election under
118 this subdivision. The trustee shall deliver
119 notice to all qualified beneficiaries and the
120 settlor of the trust, if he or she is then
121 living, of the trustee's intent to make such an
122 election at least sixty days before making that
123 election. The trustee shall have sole authority
124 to make the election. Section 469.402 shall
125 apply for all purposes of this subdivision. An
126 action or order by any court shall not be
SB 1007 83
127 required. The election shall be made by a
128 signed writing delivered to the settlor of the
129 trust, if he or she is then living, and to all
130 qualified beneficiaries. The election is
131 irrevocable, unless revoked by order of the
132 court having jurisdiction of the trust. The
133 election may specify the percentage used to
134 determine the unitrust amount pursuant to this
135 section, provided that such percentage is
136 between three and five percent, or if no
137 percentage is specified, then that percentage
138 shall be three percent. In making an election
139 pursuant to this subsection, the trustee shall
140 be subject to the same limitations and
141 conditions as apply to an adjustment between
142 income and principal pursuant to subsections 3
143 and 4 of section 469.405; and
144 (3) No action of any kind based on an
145 election made by a trustee pursuant to
146 subdivision (2) of this subsection shall be
147 brought against the trustee by any beneficiary
148 of that trust three years from the effective
149 date of that election.
150 6. (1) Once the provisions of this
151 section become applicable to a trust, the net
152 income of the trust shall be the unitrust amount.
153 (2) Unless otherwise provided by the
154 governing instrument, the unitrust amount
155 distributed each year shall be paid from the
156 following sources for that year up to the full
157 value of the unitrust amount in the following
158 order:
159 (a) Net income as determined if the trust
160 were not a unitrust;
161 (b) Other ordinary income as determined
162 for federal income tax purposes;
163 (c) Assets of the trust principal for
164 which there is a readily available market value;
165 and
166 (d) Other trust principal.
167 (3) Additionally, the trustee may allocate
168 to trust income for each taxable year of the
169 trust, or portion thereof:
170 (a) Net short-term capital gain described
171 in the Internal Revenue Code, 26 U.S.C. Section
172 1222(5), for such year, or portion thereof, but
173 only to the extent that the amount so allocated
174 together with all other amounts to trust income,
175 as determined under the provisions of this
176 chapter without regard to this section, for such
177 year, or portion thereof, does not exceed the
178 unitrust amount for such year, or portion
179 thereof;
180 (b) Net long-term capital gain described
181 in the Internal Revenue Code, 26 U.S.C. Section
182 1222(7), for such year, or portion thereof, but
183 only to the extent that the amount so allocated
SB 1007 84
184 together with all other amounts, including
185 amounts described in paragraph (a) of this
186 subdivision, allocated to trust income for such
187 year, or portion thereof, does not exceed the
188 unitrust amount for such year, or portion
189 thereof.
190 7. A trust with respect to which this
191 section applies on August 28, 2011, may
192 calculate the unitrust amount in accordance with
193 the provisions of this section, as it existed
194 either before or after such date, as the trustee
195 of such trust shall determine in a writing kept
196 with the records of the trust in the trustee's
197 discretion.]
1 [469.461. 1. A fiduciary may make
2 adjustments between principal and income to
3 offset the shifting of economic interests or tax
4 benefits between income beneficiaries and
5 remainder beneficiaries which arise from:
6 (1) Elections and decisions, other than
7 those described in subsection 2 of this section,
8 that the fiduciary makes from time to time
9 regarding tax matters;
10 (2) An income tax or any other tax that is
11 imposed upon the fiduciary or a beneficiary as a
12 result of a transaction involving or a
13 distribution from the estate or trust; or
14 (3) The ownership by an estate or trust of
15 an interest in an entity whose taxable income,
16 whether or not distributed, is includable in the
17 taxable income of the estate, trust or a
18 beneficiary.
19 2. If the amount of an estate tax marital
20 deduction or charitable contribution deduction
21 is reduced because a fiduciary deducts an amount
22 paid from principal for income tax purposes
23 instead of deducting it for estate tax purposes,
24 and as a result estate taxes paid from principal
25 are increased and income taxes paid by an
26 estate, trust or beneficiary are decreased, each
27 estate, trust or beneficiary that benefits from
28 the decrease in income tax shall reimburse the
29 principal from which the increase in estate tax
30 is paid. The total reimbursement shall equal
31 the increase in the estate tax to the extent
32 that the principal used to pay the increase
33 would have qualified for a marital deduction or
34 charitable contribution deduction but for the
35 payment. The proportionate share of the
36 reimbursement for each estate, trust or
37 beneficiary whose income taxes are reduced shall
38 be the same as its proportionate share of the
39 total decrease in income tax. An estate or
40 trust shall reimburse principal from income.]
