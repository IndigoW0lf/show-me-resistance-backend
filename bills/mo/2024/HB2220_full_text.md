18 communication, or by any combination thereof. In developing STEMI center and stroke
19 center designation criteria, the department shall use, as it deems practicable, peer-reviewed
20 and evidence-based clinical research and guidelines including, but not limited to, the most
21 recent guidelines of the American College of Cardiology, the American Heart Association, or
22 the American Stroke Association. Such rules shall include designation as a STEMI center or
23 stroke center without site review if such hospital is certified by a national body.
24 3. The department of health and senior services shall, not less than once every three
25 years, conduct a site review of every trauma, STEMI, and stroke center through appropriate
26 department personnel or a qualified contractor, with the exception of trauma centers, STEMI
27 centers, and stroke centers designated pursuant to subsection 4 of this section; however, this
28 provisionis not intended to limit the department'sability to conduct a complaint investigation
29 pursuant to subdivision (3) of subsection 2 of section 197.080 of any trauma, STEMI, or
30 stroke center. Site reviews shall be coordinated for the different types of centers to the extent
31 practicable with hospital licensure inspections conducted under chapter 197. No person shall
32 be a qualified contractor for purposes of this subsection who has a substantial conflict of
33 interest in the operation of any trauma, STEMI, or stroke center under review. The
34 department may deny, place on probation, suspend or revoke such designation in any case in
35 which it has determined there has been a substantial failure to comply with the provisions of
36 this chapter or any rules or regulations promulgated pursuant to this chapter. If a hospital
37 identified and corrected a deficiency before a site review for designation as a trauma,
38 STEMI, or stroke center, the department shall not cite such deficiency as a deficiency
39 requiring a plan of correction or use such deficiency as a reason to deny the hospital's

46 withsuchprovisionsorregulations,itmayconductadditionalannouncedorunannouncedsite
47 reviews of the hospital to verify compliance. If a trauma, STEMI, or stroke center fails two
48 consecutive site reviews because of substantial noncompliance with standards prescribed by
49 sections 190.001 to 190.245 or rules adopted by the department pursuant to sections 190.001
50 to 190.245, its center designation shall be revoked.
51 4. (1) Instead of applying for trauma, STEMI, or stroke center designation under

53 designationunder this subsection. Uponreceipt of anapplication on a formprescribed bythe
54 department, the department shall designate such hospital at a state level that corresponds to a

62 a trauma center, STEMI center, or stroke center if the hospital requests removal of the

65 decision made by the department to withdraw its designation of a center pursuant to this
66 subsection that is based on the revocation or suspension of a certification or verification by a
67 certifying or verifying organization shall not be subject to judicial review. The department
68 shall report to the certifying or verifying organization any complaint it receives related to the

71 contact information should the complainant wish to pursue a complaint with the certifying or
72 verifying organization.
