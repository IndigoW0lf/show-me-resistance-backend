240 lottery game operators as reasonably and specifically
241 requested by the commission for any violation of law, rules,
242 or regulations governing the conduct of video lottery
243 games. A video lottery game operator that fails to review
244 such surveillance video and report any known violation of
245 law, rules, or regulations governing the conduct of video
246 lottery games in conformance with established commission
247 procedures may be subject to an administrative fine not to

253 thousand dollars. In the event a video lottery game
254 operator or retailer is found to have knowingly committed a
255 violation governing the conduct of video lottery games, the
256 commission may impose an administrative fine not to exceed
257 five thousand dollars, suspend such operator's or retailer's
258 license for up to thirty days, or in the case of repeated

261 retailer aggrieved by the commission's decision in any
262 disciplinary action that results in the suspension or
263 revocation of such operator's or retailer's video lottery
264 game license may appeal such decision by filing an action in
265 circuit court. The commission shall refer a violation of
266 the criminal code, with any evidence thereof, to the
267 appropriate law enforcement officials. Video lottery game
268 retailers shall provide an intrusion detection system
269 capable of detecting unauthorized entrance of the video
270 lottery game retailer's establishment during nonbusiness

277 a conspicuous location where such video lottery game
278 terminals are located, containing in red lettering at least

281 10. (1) Video lottery game operators shall pay the
282 commission thirty-six percent of the video lottery game
283 adjusted gross receipts, which shall be deposited in the
284 state lottery fund. The commission shall transfer the
285 amount received from the operator from the lottery fund to
286 the lottery proceeds fund after administrative expenses
287 equal to four percent of the video lottery game adjusted
288 gross receipts are paid to the municipality where a licensed
289 video lottery game retailer maintains an establishment
290 licensed for the operation of video lottery game terminals,
291 or if such licensed establishment is not located within the
292 corporate boundaries of a municipality, then the county
293 where such licensed establishment is located to reimburse
294 such municipality or county for administrative expenses, and
295 any administrative expenses for the commission that are not
296 covered by reimbursements from operators are deducted. Net
297 proceeds transferred to the lottery proceeds fund shall be
298 appropriated to public elementary and secondary education
299 and public institutions of higher education with an emphasis
300 on programs to promote science, technology, engineering, and
301 mathematics (STEM) and programs to promote workforce

303 (2) Video lottery game operators shall retain sixty-
304 four percent of the video lottery game adjusted gross
305 receipts, a portion of which shall be utilized to pay for
306 administrative expenses which shall include the cost of the
307 centralized computer system, which cost shall be paid by
308 video lottery game operators in proportion to the number of
309 video lottery game terminals operated and shall not be
310 apportioned by the video lottery game operator among video
SB 1021 15
311 lottery game retailers to which it provides operations. The
312 remainder, after the costs of the centralized computer
313 system are paid, shall be divided between the video lottery
314 game operator and video lottery game retailer as agreed to
315 by the video lottery game operator and video lottery game
316 retailer under the freely negotiated agreement made under
317 subdivision (2) of subsection 7 of this section, unless the
318 video lottery game operator and video lottery game retailer
319 share the same ownership.
320 11. All revenues received by the commission from
321 license fees and any reimbursements associated with the
322 administration of the provisions of sections 313.425 to
323 313.435, and all interest earned thereon, shall be
324 considered administrative expenses and shall be deposited in
325 the state lottery fund. Moneys deposited into the state
326 lottery fund from license fees and any reimbursements of
327 commission administrative expenses to administer sections
328 313.425 to 313.435 shall be considered administrative
329 expenses and shall not be considered net proceeds pursuant
330 to article III, section 39(b) of the Missouri Constitution.
331 Subject to appropriation, up to one percent of such license
332 fees and reimbursements deposited to the credit of the state
333 lottery fund may be deposited to the credit of the
334 compulsive gamblers fund created under section 313.842. The
335 remainder of the money deposited in the state lottery fund
336 from video lottery game license fees and any reimbursements
337 of commission administrative expenses to enforce sections
338 313.425 to 313.435 shall, subject to appropriation, be used
339 for administrative expenses associated with supervising and
340 enforcing the provisions of sections 313.425 to 313.435.
341 12. The commission may contract with a state law
342 enforcement entity to assist in conducting investigations

343 into applicants for any video lottery game license and to
344 investigate violations by any video lottery game licensee of
345 any of the provisions of sections 313.425 to 313.435 or
346 state law regulating illegal gambling activities. A video
347 lottery game licensee suspected of a violation shall be
348 afforded an administrative hearing on the record and any
349 action taken to impose a fine on such licensee, or to
350 suspend or revoke the ability of a licensee to offer lottery
351 game products for sale, shall be appealed to the
352 commission. Any such administrative suspension or
353 revocation upheld by the commission may be appealed by the
