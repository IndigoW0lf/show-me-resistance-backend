AN ACT
To repeal sections 337.507 and 337.510, RSMo, and to enact in lieu thereof two new sections
relating to professional counselors.
Be it enacted by the General Assembly of the State of Missouri, as follows:
1 Section A. Sections 337.507 and 337.510, RSMo, are
2 repealed and two new sections enacted in lieu thereof, to be
3 known as sections 337.507 and 337.510, to read as follows:
1 337.507. 1. Applications for examination and
2 licensure as a professional counselor shall be in writing,
3 submitted to the division on forms prescribed by the
4 division and furnished to the applicant. The form shall
5 include a statement that the applicant has completed two
6 hours of suicide assessment, referral, treatment, and
7 management training. The application shall contain the
8 applicant's statements showing his education, experience and
9 such other information as the division may require. Each
10 application shall contain a statement that it is made under
11 oath or affirmation and that the information contained
12 therein is true and correct to the best knowledge and belief
13 of the applicant, subject to the penalties provided for the
14 making of a false affidavit or declaration. Each
15 application shall be accompanied by the fees required by the
16 committee. Within fifteen business days of receipt of an
17 application, the division shall provide electronic access
18 for applicants to view any missing information or
SB 1284 2
19 documentation. Applicants may send the requested
20 information or documentation to the division electronically,
21 except that the division may require specific submission
22 processes for documentation related to signatures,
23 transcripts, background checks, and test results. An
24 application shall be considered a complete application once
25 the division has received all required information and
26 documentation.
27 2. The division shall mail a renewal notice to the
28 last known address of each licensee prior to the
29 registration renewal date. Failure to provide the division
30 with the information required for registration, or to pay
31 the registration fee after such notice shall result in the
32 expiration of the license. The license shall be restored
33 if, within two years of the registration date, the applicant
34 provides written application and the payment of the
35 registration fee and a delinquency fee.
36 3. A new certificate to replace any certificate lost,
37 destroyed or mutilated may be issued subject to the rules of
38 the committee, upon payment of a fee.
39 4. The committee shall set the amount of the fees
40 which sections 337.500 to 337.540 authorize and require by
41 rules and regulations promulgated pursuant to section
42 536.021. The fees shall be set at a level to produce
43 revenue which shall not substantially exceed the cost and
44 expense of administering the provisions of sections 337.500
45 to 337.540. All fees provided for in sections 337.500 to
46 337.540 shall be collected by the director who shall deposit
47 the same with the state treasurer in a fund to be known as
48 the "Committee of Professional Counselors Fund".
49 5. The provisions of section 33.080 to the contrary
50 notwithstanding, money in this fund shall not be transferred
SB 1284 3
51 and placed to the credit of general revenue until the amount
52 in the fund at the end of the biennium exceeds two times the
53 amount of the appropriation from the committee's fund for
54 the preceding fiscal year or, if the committee requires by
55 rule renewal less frequently than yearly then three times
56 the appropriation from the committee's fund for the
57 preceding fiscal year. The amount, if any, in the fund
58 which shall lapse is that amount in the fund which exceeds
59 the appropriate multiple of the appropriations from the
60 committee's fund for the preceding fiscal year.
61 6. The committee shall hold public examinations at
62 least two times per year, at such times and places as may be
63 fixed by the committee, notice of such examinations to be
