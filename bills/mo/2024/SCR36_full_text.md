SENATE CONCURRENT RESOLUTION NO. 36
Whereas, American farmers and ranchers raise the best
meat in the world; and
Whereas, Americans should have the right to knowingly
buy made-in-America products; and
Whereas, American farmers, ranchers, workers, and
consumers benefit from transparency on the origins of their
food; and
Whereas, consumers have repeatedly and overwhelmingly
expressed their support for country of origin labeling of
food products in the United States; and
Whereas, in 2008, the United States Congress
overwhelmingly passed mandatory country of origin labeling
for muscle cuts and ground meat sold at retail, requiring
meat produced from imported livestock or imported boxed meat
to bear a different label from meat produced from United
States born, raised, and slaughtered livestock; and
Whereas, trade groups and the organizations
representing multinational meat packers worked predominantly
with Canada, as well as Mexico, to bring a World Trade
Organization case against the United States for the removal
of the country of origin labeling requirements; and
Whereas, in 2015, the United States Congress repealed
the country of origin labeling law for beef and pork,
reducing the competitive advantage of products born, raised,
and slaughtered in the United States; and
Whereas, the United States has the highest food safety
standards in the world, while other countries place less
emphasis on food safety; and
1
Whereas, foreign commodities like beef and pork are
misleadingly labeled "Product of the USA" if they are
processed or packed in the United States; and
Whereas, country of origin labeling gives producers and
consumers the ability to distinguish true American products
from foreign imported meat; and
Whereas, technological advancements make it possible to
accurately and efficiently identify the origins of beef and
pork without costly separation of imported and domestic
commodities; and
Whereas, country of origin labeling is good for
farmers, ranchers, workers, and meat packers because it
allows them to identify their products as born, raised, and
slaughtered in the United States; and
Whereas, the Missouri General Assembly supports
American products, and consumers deserve the right to know
the origins of their food:
Now Therefore Be It Resolved that the members of the
Missouri Senate, One Hundred Second General Assembly, second
Regular Session, the House of Representatives concurring
therein, hereby support the right of consumers to know the
origins of their food, support the use of country of origin
labels, and urge the United States Congress to reinstate
mandatory country of origin labeling; and
Be It Further Resolved that the Secretary of the Senate
be instructed to prepare properly inscribed copies of this
resolution for each member of Missouri's Congressional
delegation.
