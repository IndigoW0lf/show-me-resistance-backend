230 conforms to, the approved district solid waste management
231 plan prepared pursuant to section 260.325. The executive
232 board shall act upon the request for a recommendation within
233 sixty days of receipt and shall submit a resolution to the
234 department specifying its position and its recommendation
235 regarding conformity of the application to the solid waste
236 plan. The board's failure to submit a resolution
237 constitutes recommendation of the application. The
238 department may consider the application, regardless of the
239 board's action thereon and may deny the construction permit
240 if the application fails to meet the requirements of
241 sections 260.200 to 260.345, or if the application is

249 including inspection reports and orders issued pursuant to
250 section 260.230.
251 9. The department shall not issue a permit for the
252 operation of a solid waste disposal area designed to serve a
253 city with a population of greater than four hundred thousand
254 located in more than one county, if the site is located
255 within [one-half] one mile of an adjoining municipality,
256 without the approval of the governing body of such
257 municipality. The governing body shall conduct a public
258 hearing within fifteen days of notice, the governing body
259 shall publicize the hearing in at least one newspaper having
260 general circulation in the municipality, and shall vote to
261 approve or disapprove the land disposal facility within

292 solid waste disposal area, but prior to the beginning of
293 disposal operations, the owner and the department shall
294 execute an easement to allow the department, its agents or
295 its contractors to enter the premises to complete work
296 specified in the closure plan, or to monitor or maintain the
297 site or to take remedial action during the postclosure
298 period. After issuance of a construction permit for a solid
299 waste disposal area, but prior to the beginning of disposal
300 operations, the owner shall submit evidence that such owner
301 has recorded, in the office of the recorder of deeds in the
302 county where the disposal area is located, a notice and
303 covenant running with the land that the property has been
304 permitted as a solid waste disposal area and prohibits use
305 of the land in any manner which interferes with the closure
SB 1139 11
306 and, where appropriate, postclosure plans filed with the
307 department.
308 12. Every person desiring to obtain a permit to
309 operate a solid waste disposal area or processing facility
310 shall submit applicable information and apply for an
311 operating permit from the department. The department shall
312 review the information and determine, within sixty days of
313 receipt, whether it complies with the provisions of sections
314 260.200 to 260.345 and the rules and regulations adopted
315 pursuant to sections 260.200 to 260.345. When the review
316 reveals that the facility or area does conform with the
317 provisions of sections 260.200 to 260.345 and the rules and
318 regulations adopted pursuant to sections 260.200 to 260.345,
319 the department shall issue a permit for the operation of
320 each solid waste processing facility or solid waste disposal
321 area and with any permit terms and conditions which the
322 department deems appropriate. In the event that the
323 facility or area fails to meet the rules and regulations
324 adopted pursuant to sections 260.200 to 260.345, the
325 department shall issue a report to the applicant stating the
326 reason for denial of a permit.
327 13. Each solid waste disposal area, except utility
328 waste landfills unless otherwise and to the extent required
329 by the department, and those solid waste processing
330 facilities designated by rule, shall be operated under the
331 direction of a certified solid waste technician in
332 accordance with sections 260.200 to 260.345 and the rules
333 and regulations promulgated pursuant to sections 260.200 to
334 260.345.
335 14. Base data for the quality and quantity of
336 groundwater in the solid waste disposal area shall be
337 collected and submitted to the department prior to the
SB 1139 12
338 operation of a new or expansion of an existing solid waste
339 disposal area. Base data shall include a chemical analysis
340 of groundwater drawn from the proposed solid waste disposal
341 area.
342 15. Leachate collection and removal systems shall be
343 incorporated into new or expanded sanitary landfills which
344 are permitted after August 13, 1986. The department shall
345 assess the need for a leachate collection system for all
346 types of solid waste disposal areas, other than sanitary
347 landfills, and the need for monitoring wells when it
348 evaluates the application for all new or expanded solid
349 waste disposal areas. The department may require an
350 operator of a solid waste disposal area to install a
351 leachate collection system before the beginning of disposal
352 operations, at any time during disposal operations for
353 unfilled portions of the area, or for any portion of the
354 disposal area as a part of a remedial plan. The department
355 may require the operator to install monitoring wells before
356 the beginning of disposal operations or at any time during
357 the operational life or postclosure care period if it
358 concludes that conditions at the area warrant such
359 monitoring. The operator of a demolition landfill or
360 utility waste landfill shall not be required to install a
361 leachate collection and removal system or monitoring wells
362 unless otherwise and to the extent the department so
363 requires based on hazardous waste characteristic criteria or
364 site specific geohydrological characteristics or conditions.
365 16. Permits granted by the department, as provided in
366 sections 260.200 to 260.345, shall be subject to suspension
367 for a designated period of time, civil penalty or revocation
368 whenever the department determines that the solid waste
369 processing facility or solid waste disposal area is, or has
SB 1139 13
370 been, operated in violation of sections 260.200 to 260.345
371 or the rules or regulations adopted pursuant to sections
372 260.200 to 260.345, or has been operated in violation of any
373 permit terms and conditions, or is creating a public
374 nuisance, health hazard, or environmental pollution. In the
375 event a permit is suspended or revoked, the person named in
376 the permit shall be fully informed as to the reasons for
377 such action.
378 17. Each permit for operation of a facility or area
379 shall be issued only to the person named in the
380 application. Permits are transferable as a modification to
381 the permit. An application to transfer ownership shall
382 identify the proposed permittee. A disclosure statement for
383 the proposed permittee listing violations contained in the
384 definition of disclosure statement found in section 260.200
385 shall be submitted to the department. The operation and
386 design plans for the facility or area shall be updated to
387 provide compliance with the currently applicable law and
388 rules. A financial assurance instrument in such an amount
389 and form as prescribed by the department shall be provided
390 for solid waste disposal areas by the proposed permittee
391 prior to transfer of the permit. The financial assurance
392 instrument of the original permittee shall not be released
393 until the new permittee's financial assurance instrument has
394 been approved by the department and the transfer of
395 ownership is complete.
396 18. Those solid waste disposal areas permitted on
397 January 1, 1996, shall, upon submission of a request for
398 permit modification, be granted a solid waste management
399 area operating permit if the request meets reasonable
400 requirements set out by the department.
SB 1139 14
401 19. In case a permit required pursuant to this section
402 is denied or revoked, the person may request a hearing in
403 accordance with section 260.235.
404 20. Every applicant for a permit shall file a
405 disclosure statement with the information required by and on
406 a form developed by the department of natural resources at
407 the same time the application for a permit is filed with the
408 department.
409 21. Upon request of the director of the department of
410 natural resources, the applicant for a permit, any person
411 that could reasonably be expected to be involved in
412 management activities of the solid waste disposal area or
413 solid waste processing facility, or any person who has a
414 controlling interest in any permittee shall be required to
415 submit to a criminal background check under section 43.543.
416 22. All persons required to file a disclosure
417 statement shall provide any assistance or information
418 requested by the director or by the Missouri state highway
419 patrol and shall cooperate in any inquiry or investigation
420 conducted by the department and any inquiry, investigation
421 or hearing conducted by the director. If, upon issuance of
422 a formal request to answer any inquiry or produce
423 information, evidence or testimony, any person required to
424 file a disclosure statement refuses to comply, the
425 application of an applicant or the permit of a permittee may
426 be denied or revoked by the director.
427 23. If any of the information required to be included
428 in the disclosure statement changes, or if any additional
429 information should be added after the filing of the
430 statement, the person required to file it shall provide that
431 information to the director in writing, within thirty days
432 after the change or addition. The failure to provide such
SB 1139 15
433 information within thirty days may constitute the basis for
434 the revocation of or denial of an application for any permit
435 issued or applied for in accordance with this section, but
436 only if, prior to any such denial or revocation, the
437 director notifies the applicant or permittee of the
438 director's intention to do so and gives the applicant or
439 permittee fourteen days from the date of the notice to
440 explain why the information was not provided within the
441 required thirty-day period. The director shall consider
442 this information when determining whether to revoke, deny or
443 conditionally grant the permit.
444 24. No person shall be required to submit the
445 disclosure statement required by this section if the person
446 is a corporation or an officer, director or shareholder of
447 that corporation or any subsidiary thereof, and that
448 corporation:
449 (1) Has on file and in effect with the federal
450 Securities and Exchange Commission a registration statement
451 required under Section 5, Chapter 38, Title 1 of the
452 Securities Act of 1933, as amended, 15 U.S.C. Section 77e(c);
453 (2) Submits to the director with the application for a
454 permit evidence of the registration described in subdivision
455 (1) of this subsection and a copy of the corporation's most
456 recent annual form 10-K or an equivalent report; and
457 (3) Submits to the director on the anniversary date of
458 the issuance of any permit it holds under the Missouri solid
459 waste management law evidence of registration described in
460 subdivision (1) of this subsection and a copy of the
461 corporation's most recent annual form 10-K or an equivalent
462 report.
463 25. After permit issuance, each facility shall
464 annually file an update to the disclosure statement with the
SB 1139 16
465 department of natural resources on or before March thirty-
466 first of each year. Failure to provide such update may
467 result in penalties as provided for under section 260.240.
468 26. Any county, district, municipality, authority, or
469 other political subdivision of this state which owns and
470 operates a sanitary landfill shall be exempt from the
471 requirement for the filing of the disclosure statement and
472 annual update to the disclosure statement.
473 27. Any person seeking a permit to operate a solid
474 waste disposal area, a solid waste processing facility, or a
475 resource recovery facility shall, concurrently with the
476 filing of the application for a permit, disclose any
477 convictions in this state, county or county-equivalent
478 public health or land use ordinances related to the
