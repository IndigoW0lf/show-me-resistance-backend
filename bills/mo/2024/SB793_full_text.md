22 refunded pursuant to section 142.824; or upon the sale at
23 retail of fuel to be consumed in manufacturing or creating
24 gas, power, steam, electrical current or in furnishing water

27 to be sold ultimately in processed form at retail; or seed,
28 limestone or fertilizer which is to be used for seeding,
29 liming or fertilizing crops which when harvested will be
30 sold at retail or will be fed to livestock or poultry to be
31 sold ultimately in processed form at retail; economic
32 poisons registered pursuant to the provisions of the
33 Missouri pesticide registration law, sections 281.220 to
34 281.310, which are to be used in connection with the growth

36 before, during, or after planting, the crop of which when

40 (2) Materials, manufactured goods, machinery and parts
41 which when used in manufacturing, processing, compounding,
42 mining, producing or fabricating become a component part or
43 ingredient of the new personal property resulting from such
44 manufacturing, processing, compounding, mining, producing or
45 fabricating and which new personal property is intended to
46 be sold ultimately for final use or consumption; and
47 materials, including without limitation, gases and
48 manufactured goods, including without limitation slagging
49 materials and firebrick, which are ultimately consumed in
SB 793 3
50 the manufacturing process by blending, reacting or
51 interacting with or by becoming, in whole or in part,
52 component parts or ingredients of steel products intended to
53 be sold ultimately for final use or consumption;
54 (3) Materials, replacement parts and equipment
55 purchased for use directly upon, and for the repair and
56 maintenance or manufacture of, motor vehicles, watercraft,
57 railroad rolling stock or aircraft engaged as common
58 carriers of persons or property;
59 (4) Replacement machinery, equipment, and parts and
60 the materials and supplies solely required for the
61 installation or construction of such replacement machinery,
62 equipment, and parts, used directly in manufacturing,
63 mining, fabricating or producing a product which is intended
64 to be sold ultimately for final use or consumption; and
65 machinery and equipment, and the materials and supplies
66 required solely for the operation, installation or
67 construction of such machinery and equipment, purchased and
68 used to establish new, or to replace or expand existing,
69 material recovery processing plants in this state. For the
70 purposes of this subdivision, a "material recovery
71 processing plant" means a facility that has as its primary
72 purpose the recovery of materials into a usable product or a
73 different form which is used in producing a new product and
74 shall include a facility or equipment which are used
75 exclusively for the collection of recovered materials for
76 delivery to a material recovery processing plant but shall
77 not include motor vehicles used on highways. For purposes
78 of this section, the terms motor vehicle and highway shall
79 have the same meaning pursuant to section 301.010. For the
80 purposes of this subdivision, subdivision (5) of this
81 subsection, and section 144.054, as well as the definition
SB 793 4
82 in subdivision (9) of subsection 1 of section 144.010, the
83 term "product" includes telecommunications services and the
84 term "manufacturing" shall include the production, or
85 production and transmission, of telecommunications
86 services. The preceding sentence does not make a
87 substantive change in the law and is intended to clarify
88 that the term "manufacturing" has included and continues to
89 include the production and transmission of
90 "telecommunications services", as enacted in this
91 subdivision and subdivision (5) of this subsection, as well
92 as the definition in subdivision (9) of subsection 1 of
93 section 144.010. The preceding two sentences reaffirm
94 legislative intent consistent with the interpretation of
95 this subdivision and subdivision (5) of this subsection in
96 Southwestern Bell Tel. Co. v. Director of Revenue, 78 S.W.3d
97 763 (Mo. banc 2002) and Southwestern Bell Tel. Co. v.
98 Director of Revenue, 182 S.W.3d 226 (Mo. banc 2005), and
99 accordingly abrogates the Missouri supreme court's
100 interpretation of those exemptions in IBM Corporation v.
101 Director of Revenue, 491 S.W.3d 535 (Mo. banc 2016) to the
102 extent inconsistent with this section and Southwestern Bell
103 Tel. Co. v. Director of Revenue, 78 S.W.3d 763 (Mo. banc
104 2002) and Southwestern Bell Tel. Co. v. Director of Revenue,
105 182 S.W.3d 226 (Mo. banc 2005). The construction and
106 application of this subdivision as expressed by the Missouri
107 supreme court in DST Systems, Inc. v. Director of Revenue,
108 43 S.W.3d 799 (Mo. banc 2001); Southwestern Bell Tel. Co. v.
109 Director of Revenue, 78 S.W.3d 763 (Mo. banc 2002); and
110 Southwestern Bell Tel. Co. v. Director of Revenue, 182
111 S.W.3d 226 (Mo. banc 2005), is hereby affirmed. Material
112 recovery is not the reuse of materials within a
113 manufacturing process or the use of a product previously
SB 793 5
114 recovered. The material recovery processing plant shall
115 qualify under the provisions of this section regardless of
116 ownership of the material being recovered;
117 (5) Machinery and equipment, and parts and the
118 materials and supplies solely required for the installation
119 or construction of such machinery and equipment, purchased
120 and used to establish new or to expand existing

122 such machinery and equipment is used directly in
123 manufacturing, mining or fabricating a product which is
124 intended to be sold ultimately for final use or
125 consumption. The construction and application of this

129 Revenue, 78 S.W.3d 763 (Mo. banc 2002); and Southwestern
130 Bell Tel. Co. v. Director of Revenue, 182 S.W.3d 226 (Mo.
131 banc 2005), is hereby affirmed;

158 this subsection, in facilities owned or leased by the
159 taxpayer, if the total cost of electrical energy so used
160 exceeds ten percent of the total cost of production, either
161 primary or secondary, exclusive of the cost of electrical
162 energy so used or if the raw materials used in such
163 processing contain at least twenty-five percent recovered
164 materials as defined in section 260.200. There shall be a
165 rebuttable presumption that the raw materials used in the
166 primary manufacture of automobiles contain at least twenty-
167 five percent recovered materials. For purposes of this
168 subdivision, "processing" means any mode of treatment, act
169 or series of acts performed upon materials to transform and
