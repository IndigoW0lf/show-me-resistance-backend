AN ACT
To amend chapter 210, RSMo, by adding thereto one new section relating to the CTF medical alert
system, with penalty provisions.
Be it enacted by the General Assembly of the State of Missouri, as follows:
1 Section A. Chapter 210, RSMo, is amended by adding thereto
2 one new section, to be known as section 210.1015, to read as
3 follows:
1 210.1015. 1. There is hereby created a statewide
2 program called the "Christian Taylor Ferguson ("CTF")
3 Medical Alert System" referred to in this section as the
4 "system" to aid in the identification and location of a
5 missing endangered person.
6 2. For the purposes of this section, the term
7 "endangered person" shall mean an individual, including a
8 child, who is missing under unexplained, involuntary, or
9 suspicious circumstances and is believed to be in danger
10 because of a medical condition that requires immediate care,
11 medication, or treatment.
12 3. The department of public safety shall develop
13 regions to provide the system. The department of public
14 safety shall coordinate local law enforcement agencies and
15 public commercial television and radio broadcasters to
16 provide an effective system. In the event that a local law
17 enforcement agency opts not to set up a system and a report
18 of a missing endangered person occurs within the
SB 1155 2
19 jurisdiction, the agency shall notify the department of
20 public safety who shall notify local media in the region.
21 4. The system shall include all state agencies capable
22 of providing urgent and timely information to the public
23 together with broadcasters and other private entities that
24 volunteer to participate in the dissemination of urgent
25 public information. At a minimum, the system shall include
26 the department of public safety, state highway patrol,
27 department of transportation, department of health and
28 senior services, and Missouri lottery.
29 5. Participation in the system is entirely at the
30 option of local law enforcement agencies and federally
31 licensed radio and television broadcasters.
32 6. Any person who knowingly makes a false report that
33 triggers an alert pursuant to this section is guilty of a
34 class A misdemeanor.
35 7. The department of public safety shall administer
36 and promulgate rules for implementation of the system. Any
37 rule or portion of a rule, as that term is defined in
38 section 536.010, that is created under the authority
39 delegated in this section shall become effective only if it
40 complies with and is subject to all of the provisions of
41 chapter 536 and, if applicable, section 536.028. This
42 section and chapter 536 are nonseverable and if any of the
43 powers vested with the general assembly pursuant to chapter
44 536 to review, to delay the effective date, or to disapprove
45 and annul a rule are subsequently held unconstitutional,
46 then the grant of rulemaking authority and any rule proposed
47 or adopted after August 28, 2024, shall be invalid and void.
