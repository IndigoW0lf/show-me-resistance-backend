7 The money in the fund shall be distributed to the public
8 school districts of the state in the manner provided in
9 sections 163.031 and 163.087 and shall be appropriated and

SB 729 5
13 percentage of any refund shall be paid from the school

18 not exceed two and one-half million dollars or one percent
19 of the amount deposited in the fund, whichever is less. The
20 fee shall be negotiated annually through the appropriation
21 process. Any balance remaining in the fund at the end of an
22 appropriation period shall not be transferred to general
23 revenue, and the provisions of section 33.080 shall not
