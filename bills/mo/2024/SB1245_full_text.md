155 10. In those cases where the charges filed pursuant to
156 this section are based upon an allegation of misconduct
157 involving a minor child, the hearing officer may accept into
158 the record the sworn testimony of the minor child relating
159 to the misconduct received in any court or administrative
160 hearing.
161 11. Hearings, appeals or other matters involving
162 certificate holders, licensees or applicants pursuant to
163 this section may be informally resolved by consent agreement
164 or agreed settlement or voluntary surrender of the
165 certificate of license pursuant to the rules promulgated by
166 the state board of education.
167 12. The final decision of the state board of education
168 is subject to judicial review pursuant to sections 536.100
169 to 536.140.
170 13. A certificate of license to teach to an individual
171 who has been convicted of a felony or crime involving moral
172 turpitude, whether or not sentence is imposed, shall be
173 issued only upon motion of the state board of education
174 adopted by a unanimous affirmative vote of those members
175 present and voting.

191 contendere to, or been found guilty of any of the following
192 offenses or offenses of a similar nature established under
193 the laws of this, any other state, the United States, or any

241 administrative hearing commission. Notice of such appeal
242 must be received by the administrative hearing commission
243 within ninety days of mailing, by certified mail, the notice
244 of revocation. Failure of a person whose license was
245 revoked to notify the administrative hearing commission of
246 his or her intent to appeal waives all rights to appeal the
247 revocation. Upon notice of such person's intent to appeal,
SB 1245 41
248 a hearing shall be held before the administrative hearing
249 commission.
1 491.075. 1. A statement made by a child under the age

13 the proceedings; or
14 (b) The child or vulnerable person is unavailable as a

16 (c) The child or vulnerable person is otherwise
17 physically available as a witness but the court finds that
18 the significant emotional or psychological trauma which
19 would result from testifying in the personal presence of the
20 defendant makes the child or vulnerable person unavailable
21 as a witness at the time of the criminal proceeding.
22 2. Notwithstanding subsection 1 of this section or any
23 provision of law or rule of evidence requiring corroboration
24 of statements, admissions or confessions of the defendant,

31 vulnerable person is available to testify regarding the
32 offense.
33 3. A statement may not be admitted under this section
34 unless the prosecuting attorney makes known to the accused

49 child of [fourteen] seventeen years of age.
1 492.304. 1. In addition to the admissibility of a
2 statement under the provisions of section 492.303, the
3 visual and aural recording of a verbal or nonverbal
4 statement of a child when under the age of [fourteen who is
5 alleged to be a victim of] eighteen or a vulnerable person,

29 or vulnerable person in the recording is present at the

32 (7) The defendant or the attorney for the defendant is
33 afforded an opportunity to view the recording before it is
34 offered into evidence.
35 2. If the child or vulnerable person does not testify
36 at the proceeding, the visual and aural recording of a
37 verbal or nonverbal statement of the child or vulnerable
38 person shall not be admissible under this section unless the
39 recording qualifies for admission under section 491.075.
40 3. If the visual and aural recording of a verbal or
41 nonverbal statement of a child or vulnerable person is
42 admissible under this section and the child or vulnerable
43 person testifies at the proceeding, it shall be admissible

26 or after August 28, [2004, including any action which would
27 have been barred by the application of the statute of
28 limitation applicable prior to that date] 2024.
1 542.301. 1. Property which comes into the custody of
2 an officer or of a court as the result of any seizure and
3 which has not been forfeited pursuant to any other
4 provisions of law or returned to the claimant shall be
5 disposed of as follows:
6 (1) Stolen property, or property acquired in any other
7 manner declared an offense by chapters 569 and 570, but not
8 including any of the property referred to in subdivision (2)
9 of this subsection, shall be delivered by order of court
10 upon claim having been made and established, to the person
11 who is entitled to possession:
12 (a) The claim shall be made by written motion filed
13 with the court with which a motion to suppress has been, or
14 may be, filed. The claim shall be barred if not made within
15 one year from the date of the seizure;
16 (b) Upon the filing of such motion, the judge shall
17 order notice to be given to all persons interested in the
18 property, including other claimants and the person from
19 whose possession the property was seized, of the time, place
20 and nature of the hearing to be held on the motion. The
21 notice shall be given in a manner reasonably calculated to
22 reach the attention of all interested persons. Notice may
SB 1245 46
23 be given to unknown persons and to persons whose address is
24 unknown by publication in a newspaper of general circulation
25 in the county. No property shall be delivered to any
26 claimant unless all interested persons have been given a
27 reasonable opportunity to appear and to be heard;
28 (c) After a hearing, the judge shall order the
29 property delivered to the person or persons entitled to
30 possession, if any. The judge may direct that delivery of
31 property required as evidence in a criminal proceeding shall
32 be postponed until the need no longer exists;
33 (d) A law enforcement officer having custody of seized
34 property may, at any time that seized property has ceased to
35 be useful as evidence, request that the prosecuting attorney
36 of the county in which property was seized file a motion
37 with the court of such county for the disposition of the
38 seized property. If the prosecuting attorney does not file
39 such motion within sixty days of the request by the law
40 enforcement officer having custody of the seized property,
41 then such officer may request that the attorney general file
42 a written motion with the circuit court of the county or
43 judicial district in which the seizure occurred. Upon
44 filing of the motion, the court shall issue an order
45 directing the disposition of the property. Such disposition
46 may, if the property is not claimed within one year from the
47 date of the seizure or if no one establishes a right to it,
48 and the seized property has ceased to be useful as evidence,
49 include a public sale of the property. Pursuant to a motion
50 properly filed and granted under this section, the proceeds
51 of any sale, less necessary expenses of preservation and
52 sale, shall be paid into the county treasury for the use of
53 the county. If the property is not salable, the judge may
54 order its destruction. Notwithstanding any other provision
SB 1245 47
55 of law, if no claim is filed within one year of the seizure
56 and no motion pursuant to this section is filed within six
57 months thereafter, and the seized property has ceased to be
58 useful as evidence, the property shall be deemed abandoned,
59 converted to cash and shall be turned over immediately to
60 the treasurer pursuant to section 447.543;
61 (e) If the property is a living animal or is
62 perishable, the judge may, at any time, order it sold at
63 public sale. The proceeds shall be held in lieu of the
64 property. A written description of the property sold shall
65 be filed with the judge making the order of sale so that the
66 claimant may identify the property. If the proceeds are not
67 claimed within the time limited for the claim of the
68 property, the proceeds shall be paid into the county
69 treasury. If the property is not salable, the judge may
70 order its destruction.
71 (2) Weapons, tools, devices, computers, computer
72 equipment, computer software, computer hardware, cellular
73 telephones, or other devices capable of accessing the
74 internet, and substances other than motor vehicles, aircraft
75 or watercraft, used by the owner or with the owner's consent
76 as a means for committing felonies other than the offense of
77 possessing burglary tools in violation of section 569.180,
78 and property, the possession of which is an offense under
79 the laws of this state or which has been used by the owner,
80 or used with the owner's acquiescence or consent, as a raw
81 material or as an instrument to manufacture, produce, or
82 distribute, or be used as a means of storage of anything the
83 possession of which is an offense under the laws of this
84 state, or which any statute authorizes or directs to be
85 seized, other than lawfully possessed weapons seized by an
SB 1245 48
86 officer incident to an arrest, shall be forfeited to the
87 state of Missouri.
88 2. The officer who has custody of the property shall
89 inform the prosecuting attorney of the fact of seizure and
90 of the nature of the property. The prosecuting attorney
91 shall thereupon file a written motion with the court with
92 which the motion to suppress has been, or may be, filed
93 praying for an order directing the forfeiture of the
94 property. If the prosecuting attorney of a county in which
95 property is seized fails to file a motion with the court for
96 the disposition of the seized property within sixty days of
97 the request by a law enforcement officer, the officer having
98 custody of the seized property may request the attorney
99 general to file a written motion with the circuit court of
100 the county or judicial district in which the seizure
101 occurred. Upon filing of the motion, the court shall issue
102 an order directing the disposition of the property. The
103 signed motion shall be returned to the requesting agency. A
104 motion may also be filed by any person claiming the right to
105 possession of the property praying that the court declare
106 the property not subject to forfeiture and order it
107 delivered to the moving party.
108 3. Upon the filing of a motion either by the
109 prosecuting attorney or by a claimant, the judge shall order
110 notice to be given to all persons interested in the
111 property, including the person out of whose possession the
112 property was seized and any lienors, of the time, place and
113 nature of the hearing to be held on the motion. The notice
114 shall be given in a manner reasonably calculated to reach
115 the attention of all interested persons. Notice may be
116 given to unknown persons and to persons of unknown address
117 by publication in a newspaper of general circulation in the
SB 1245 49
118 county. Every interested person shall be given a reasonable
119 opportunity to appear and to be heard as to the nature of
120 the person's claim to the property and upon the issue of
121 whether or not it is subject to forfeiture.
122 4. If the evidence is clear and convincing that the
123 property in issue is in fact of a kind subject to forfeiture
124 under this subsection, the judge shall declare it forfeited
125 and order its destruction or sale. The judge shall direct
126 that the destruction or sale of property needed as evidence
127 in a criminal proceeding shall be postponed until this need
128 no longer exists.
129 5. If the forfeited property can be put to a lawful
130 use, it may be ordered sold after any alterations which are
131 necessary to adapt it to a lawful use have been made. In
132 the case of computers, computer equipment, computer
133 software, computer hardware, cellular telephones, or other
134 devices capable of accessing the internet, or other devices
135 used in the acquisition, possession, or distribution of
136 child pornography as it existed prior to August 28, 2024,
137 child sexual abuse material, or obscene material, the law
138 enforcement agency in possession of such items may, upon
139 court order, retain possession of such property and convert
140 such property to the use of the law enforcement agency for
141 use in criminal investigations. If there is a holder of a
142 bona fide lien against property which has been used as a
143 means for committing an offense or which has been used as a
144 raw material or as an instrument to manufacture or produce
145 anything which is an offense to possess, who establishes
146 that the use was without the lienholder's acquiescence or
147 consent, the proceeds, less necessary expenses of
148 preservation and sale, shall be paid to the lienholder to
SB 1245 50
149 the amount of the lienholder's lien. The remaining amount
150 shall be paid into the county treasury.
151 6. If the property is perishable the judge may order
152 it sold at a public sale or destroyed, as may be
153 appropriate, prior to a hearing. The proceeds of a sale,
154 less necessary expenses of preservation and sale, shall be
155 held in lieu of the property.
156 7. When a warrant has been issued to search for and
157 seize allegedly obscene matter for forfeiture to the state,
158 after an adversary hearing, the judge, upon return of the
159 warrant with the matter seized, shall give notice of the
160 fact to the prosecuting attorney of the county in which the
161 matter was seized and the dealer, exhibitor or displayer and
162 shall conduct further adversary proceedings to determine
163 whether the matter is subject to forfeiture. If the
164 evidence is clear and convincing that the matter is obscene
165 as defined by law and it was being held or displayed for
166 sale, exhibition, distribution or circulation to the public,
167 the judge shall declare it to be obscene and forfeited to
168 the state and order its destruction or other disposition;
169 except that, no forfeiture shall be declared without the
170 dealer, distributor or displayer being given a reasonable
171 opportunity to appear in opposition and without the judge
172 having thoroughly examined each item. If the material to be
173 seized is the same as or another copy of matter that has
174 already been determined to be obscene in a criminal
175 proceeding against the dealer, exhibitor, displayer or such
176 person's agent, the determination of obscenity in the
177 criminal proceeding shall constitute clear and convincing
178 evidence that the matter to be forfeited pursuant to this
179 subsection is obscene. Except when the dealer, exhibitor or
180 displayer consents to a longer period, or by such person's
SB 1245 51
181 actions or pleadings willfully prevents the prompt
182 resolution of the hearing, judgment shall be rendered within
183 ten days of the return of the warrant. If the matter is not
184 found to be obscene or is not found to have been held or
185 displayed for sale, exhibition or distribution to the
186 public, or a judgment is not entered within the time
187 provided for, the matter shall be restored forthwith to the
188 dealer, exhibitor or displayer.
189 8. If an appeal is taken by the dealer, exhibitor or
190 displayer from an adverse judgment, the case should be
191 assigned for hearing at the earliest practicable date and
192 expedited in every way. Destruction or disposition of a
193 matter declared forfeited shall be postponed until the
194 judgment has become final by exhaustion of appeal, or by
195 expiration of the time for appeal, and until the matter is
196 no longer needed as evidence in a criminal proceeding.
197 9. A determination of obscenity, pursuant to this
198 subsection, shall not be admissible in any criminal
199 proceeding against any person or corporation for sale or
200 possession of obscene matter; except that dealer,
201 distributor or displayer from which the obscene matter was
202 seized for forfeiture to the state.
203 10. When allegedly obscene matter or pornographic
204 material for minors has been seized under a search warrant
205 issued pursuant to subsection 2 of section 542.281 and the
206 matter is no longer needed as evidence in a criminal
207 proceeding the prosecuting attorney of the county in which
208 the matter was seized may file a written motion with the
209 circuit court of the county or judicial district in which
210 the seizure occurred praying for an order directing the
211 forfeiture of the matter. Upon filing of the motion, the
212 court shall set a date for a hearing. Written notice of
SB 1245 52
213 date, time, place and nature of the hearing shall be
214 personally served upon the owner, dealer, exhibitor,
215 displayer or such person's agent. Such notice shall be
216 served no less than five days before the hearing.
217 11. If the evidence is clear and convincing that the
218 matter is obscene as defined by law, and that the obscene
219 material was being held or displayed for sale, exhibition,
220 distribution or circulation to the public or that the matter
221 is pornographic for minors and that the pornographic
222 material was being held or displayed for sale, exhibition,
223 distribution or circulation to minors, the judge shall
224 declare it to be obscene or pornographic for minors and
225 forfeited to the state and order its destruction or other
226 disposition. A determination that the matter is obscene in
227 a criminal proceeding as well as a determination that such
228 obscene material was held or displayed for sale, exhibition,
229 distribution or circulation to the public or a determination
230 that the matter is pornographic for minors in a criminal
231 proceeding as well as a determination that such pornographic
232 material was held or displayed for sale, exhibition,
233 distribution or circulation to minors shall be clear and
234 convincing evidence that such material should be forfeited
235 to the state; except that, no forfeiture shall be declared
236 without the dealer, distributor or displayer being given a
237 reasonable opportunity to appear in opposition and without a
238 judge having thoroughly examined each item. A dealer,
239 distributor or displayer shall have had reasonable
240 opportunity to appear in opposition if the matter the
241 prosecutor seeks to destroy is the same matter that formed
242 the basis of a criminal proceeding against the dealer,
243 distributor or displayer where the dealer, distributor or
244 displayer has been charged and found guilty of holding or
SB 1245 53
245 displaying for sale, exhibiting, distributing or circulating
246 obscene material to the public or pornographic material for
247 minors to minors. If the matter is not found to be obscene,
248 or if obscene material is not found to have been held or
249 displayed for sale, exhibition, distribution or circulation
250 to the public, or if the matter is not found to be
251 pornographic for minors or if pornographic material is not
252 found to have been held or displayed for sale, exhibition,
253 distribution or circulation to minors, the matter shall be
254 restored forthwith to the dealer, exhibitor or displayer.
255 12. If an appeal is taken by the dealer, exhibitor or
256 displayer from an adverse judgment, the case shall be
257 assigned for hearing at the earliest practicable date and
258 expedited in every way. Destruction or disposition of
259 matter declared forfeited shall be postponed until the
260 judgment has become final by exhaustion of appeal, or by
261 expiration of the time for appeal, and until the matter is
262 no longer needed as evidence in a criminal proceeding.
263 13. A determination of obscenity shall not be
264 admissible in any criminal proceeding against any person or
265 corporation for sale or possession of obscene matter.
266 14. An appeal by any party shall be allowed from the
267 judgment of the court as in other civil actions.
268 15. All other property still in the custody of an
269 officer or of a court as the result of any seizure and which
270 has not been forfeited pursuant to this section or any other
271 provision of law after three years following the seizure and
272 which has ceased to be useful as evidence shall be deemed
273 abandoned, converted to cash and shall be turned over
274 immediately to the treasurer pursuant to section 447.543.
