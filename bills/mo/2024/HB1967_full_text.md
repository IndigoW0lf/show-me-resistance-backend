19 event or unusual strain identifiable by time and place of occurrence and producing at the time
20 objective symptoms of an injury caused by a specific event during a single work shift. An
21 injury is not compensable because work was a triggering or precipitating factor.
22 3. (1) In this chapter the term "injury" is hereby defined to be an injury which has
23 arisen out of and in the course of employment. An injury by accident is compensable only if
24 the accident was the prevailing factor in causing [both] the injury, the resulting medical
25 condition [and], the disability, and the need for treatment. "The prevailing factor" is
26 defined to be the primary factor, in relation to any other factor, causing [both] the injury, the
27 resulting medical condition [and], the disability, and the need for treatment.
28 (2) An injury shall be deemed to arise out of and in the course of the employment
29 only if:
30 (a) It is reasonably apparent, upon consideration of all the circumstances, that the
31 accident is the prevailing factor in causing the injury; and
32 (b) It does not come from a hazard or risk unrelated to the employment to which
33 workers would have been equally exposed outside of and unrelated to the employment in
34 normal nonemployment life.
35 (3) An injury resulting directly or indirectly from idiopathic causes is not
36 compensable.
37 (4) A cardiovascular, pulmonary, respiratory, or other disease, or cerebrovascular
38 accident or myocardial infarction suffered by a worker is an injury only if the accident is the
39 prevailing factor in causing the resulting medical condition.

41 structure of the body and to the personal property which is used to make up the physical
42 structure of the body, such as artificial dentures, artificial limbs, glass eyes, eyeglasses, and
43 other prostheses which are placed in or on the body to replace the physical structure and such
44 disease or infection as naturally results therefrom. These terms shall in no case except as

57 liability for accidents that occur on property not owned or controlled by the employer even if
58 the accident occurs on customary, approved, permitted, usual or accepted routes used by the
59 employee to get to and from their place of employment.
60 6. The term "total disability" as used in this chapter shall mean inability to return to
61 any employment and not merely mean inability to return to the employment in which the
62 employee was engaged at the time of the accident.

4 life to which the general public is exposed outside of the employment shall not be
5 compensable, except where the diseases follow as an incident of an occupational disease as
6 defined in this section. The disease need not to have been foreseen or expected but after its
7 contraction it must appear to have had its origin in a risk connected with the employment and
8 to have flowed from that source as a rational consequence.
9 2. An injury ordeath by occupational disease is compensableonly if the occupational
10 exposure was the prevailing factor in causing [both] the injury, the resulting medical
11 condition [and], the disability, and the need for treatment. The "prevailing factor" is
12 defined to be the primary factor, in relation to any other factor, causing [both] the injury, the
13 resulting medical condition [and], the disability, and the need for treatment. Ordinary,
14 gradual deterioration, or progressive degeneration of the body caused by aging or by the
15 normal activities of day-to-day living shall not be compensable.
16 3. An injury due to repetitive motion is recognized as an occupational disease for
17 purposes of this chapter. An occupational disease due to repetitive motion is compensable
18 only if the occupational exposure was the prevailing factor in causing [both] the injury, the
19 resulting medical condition [and], the disability, and the need for treatment. The
20 "prevailing factor" is defined to be the primary factor, in relation to any other factor, causing
21 [both] the injury, the resulting medical condition [and], the disability, and the need for
22 treatment. Ordinary, gradual deterioration, or progressive degeneration of the body caused

27 capable of producing occupational deafness.
28 5. "Radiation disability" is recognized as an occupational disease for purposes of this
29 chapter and is hereby defined to be that disability due to radioactive properties or substances
30 or to Roentgen rays (X-rays) or exposure to ionizing radiation caused by any process
31 involving the use of or direct contact with radium or radioactive properties or substances or
32 the use of or direct exposure to Roentgen rays (X-rays) or ionizing radiation.

37 or paid police officers of a paid police department certified under chapter 590 if a direct
HB 1967 5
38 causal relationship is established, or psychological stress of firefighters of a paid fire
39 department or paid peace officers of a police department who are certified under chapter 590
40 if a direct causal relationship is established.
41 7. Any employee who is exposed to and contracts any contagious or communicable
42 disease arising out of and in the course of his or her employment shall be eligible for benefits
43 under this chapter as an occupational disease.
44 8. With regard to occupational disease due to repetitive motion, if the exposure to the
45 repetitive motion which is found to be the cause of the injury is for a period of less than three
46 months and the evidence demonstrates that the exposure to the repetitive motion with the
47 immediate prior employer was the prevailing factor in causing the injury, the prior employer
48 shall be liable for such occupational disease.
49 9. (1) (a) Posttraumatic stress disorder (PTSD), as described in the Diagnostic and
50 Statistical Manual of Mental Health Disorders, Fifth Edition, published by the American
51 Psychiatric Association, (DSM-5) is recognized as a compensable occupational disease for
52 purposes of this chapter when diagnosed in a first responder, as that term is defined under
53 section 67.145.
54 (b) Benefits payable to a first responder under this section shall not require a physical
55 injury to the first responder, and are not subject to any preexisting PTSD.
56 (c) Benefits payable to a first responder under this section are compensable only if
57 demonstrated by clear and convincing evidence that PTSD has resulted from the course and
58 scope of employment, and the first responder is examined and diagnosed with PTSD by an
59 authorized treating physician, due to the first responder experiencing one of the following
60 qualifying events:
61 a. Seeing for oneself a deceased minor;
62 b. Witnessing directly the death of a minor;
63 c. Witnessing directly the injury to a minor who subsequently died prior to or upon
64 arrival at a hospital emergency department, participating in the physical treatment of, or
65 manually transporting, an injured minor who subsequently died prior to or upon arrival at a
66 hospital emergency department;

73 physical injury that shocks the conscience;
HB 1967 6
74 g. Participating in the physical treatment of an injury, including attempted suicide, or
75 manually transporting an injured person who suffered serious physical injury, if the injured
76 person subsequently died prior to or upon arrival at a hospital emergency department; or
77 h. Involvement in an event that caused or may have caused serious injury or harm to
78 the first responder or had the potential to cause the death of the first responder, whether
79 accidental or by an intentional act of another individual.
80 (2) The time for notice of injury or death in cases of compensable PTSD under this
81 section is measured from exposure to one of the qualifying stressors listed in the DSM-5
82 criteria, or the diagnosis of the disorder, whichever is later. Any claim for compensation for
83 such injury shall be properly noticed within fifty-two weeks after the qualifying exposure, or
84 the diagnosis of the disorder, whichever is later.
287.140. 1. In addition to all other compensation paid to the employee under this
2 section, the employee shall receive and the employer shall provide such medical, surgical,
3 chiropractic, and hospital treatment, including nursing, custodial, ambulance and medicines,
4 as may reasonably be required after the injury or disability, to cure and relieve from the
5 effects of the injury. For an employee to receive such treatment, the accident or
6 occupational disease shall be the prevailing factor in causing the injury, the resulting
7 medical condition, and the need for treatment. If the employee desires, he or she shall
8 have the right to select his or her own physician,surgeon, orother such requirement at his or
9 her own expense. Where the requirements are furnished by a public hospital or other
10 institution, payment therefor shall be made to the proper authorities. Regardless of whether
11 the health care provider is selected by the employer or is selected by the employee at the
12 employee's expense, the health care provider shall have the affirmative duty to communicate
13 fully with the employee regarding the nature of the employee's injury and recommended
14 treatment exclusive of any evaluation for a permanent disability rating. Failure to perform
15 such duty to communicate shall constitute a disciplinary violation by the provider subject to
16 the provisions of chapter [620] 334. When an employee is required to submit to medical
17 examinations or necessary medical treatment at a place outside of the local or metropolitan
18 area from the employee's principal place of employment, the employer or its insurer shall
19 advance or reimburse the employee for all necessary and reasonable expenses; except that an
20 injured employee who resides outside the state of Missouri and who is employed by an
21 employer located in Missouri shall have the option of selecting the location of services
22 provided in this section either at a location within one hundred miles of the injured
23 employee'sresidence,placeofinjuryorplaceofhirebytheemployer. Thechoiceofprovider
24 within the location selected shall continue to be made by the employer. In case of a medical
25 examination if a dispute arises as to what expenses shall be paid by the employer, the matter
26 shall be presented to the legal advisor, the administrative law judge or the commission, who
HB 1967 7
27 shall set the sum to be paid and same shall be paid by the employer prior to the medical
28 examination. In no event, however, shall the employer or its insurer be required to pay
29 transportationcostsforagreaterdistancethantwohundredfiftymileseachwayfromplaceof
30 treatment.
31 2. If it be shown to the division or the commission that the requirements are being
32 furnished in such manner that there is reasonable ground for believing that the life, health, or
33 recovery of the employee is endangered thereby, the division or the commission may order a
34 change in the physician, surgeon, hospital or other requirement.
35 3. Allfeesandchargesunderthischaptershallbefairandreasonable,shallbesubject

39 receives for the same treatment or service when the payor for such treatment or service is a
40 privateindividualoraprivatehealthinsurancecarrier. Thedivisionorthecommission,orthe
41 board of rehabilitation in rehabilitation cases, shall also have jurisdiction to hear and
42 determine all disputes as to such charges. A health care provider is bound by the
43 determination upon the reasonableness of health care bills.
44 4. The division shall, by regulation, establish methods to resolve disputes concerning
45 the reasonableness of medical charges, services, or aids. This regulation shall govern
46 resolution of disputes between employers and medical providers over fees charged, whether
47 or not paid, and shall be in lieu of any other administrative procedure under this chapter. The
48 employee shall not be a party to a dispute over medical charges, nor shall the employee's
49 recovery in any way be jeopardized because of such dispute. Any application for payment of

73 8. The employer may be required by the division or the commission to furnish an
74 injured employee with artificial legs, arms, hands, surgical orthopedic joints, or eyes, or
75 braces, as needed, for life whenever the division or the commission shall find that the injured
76 employee may be partially or wholly relieved of the effects of a permanent injury by the use
77 thereof. The director of the division shall establish a procedure whereby a claim for
78 compensationmaybereactivatedaftersettlementofsuchclaimiscompleted. Theclaimshall
79 be reactivated only after the claimant can show good cause for the reactivation of this claim
80 and the claim shall be made only for the payment of medical procedures involving life-
81 threatening surgical procedures or if the claimant requires the use of a new, or the
82 modification, alteration or exchange of an existing, prosthetic device. For the purpose of this
83 subsection, "life threatening" shall mean a situation or condition which, if not treated
84 immediately, will likely result in the death of the injured worker.
85 9. Nothing in this chapter shall prevent an employee being provided treatment for his
86 or her injuries by prayer or spiritual means if the employer does not object to the treatment.

104 physician or health care provider selected by the employee at his or her own expense
105 pursuant to subsection 1 of this section, shall bill or attempt to collect any fee or any portion
106 of a fee for services rendered to an employee due to a work-related injury or report to any
107 credit reporting agency any failure of the employee to make such payment, when an injury
108 covered by this chapter has occurred and such hospital, physician or health care provider has
109 received actual notice given in writing by the employee, the employer or the employer's
