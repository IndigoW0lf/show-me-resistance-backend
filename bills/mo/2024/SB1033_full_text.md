100 those orders and shall pray for the orders desired.
101 [5.] 6. In making an award of custody, the court shall
102 consider all relevant factors including the presumption that
103 the best interests of the child will be served by placing
104 the child in the custody and care of the nonabusive parent,
105 unless there is evidence that both parents have engaged in
106 abusive behavior, in which case the court shall not consider
107 this presumption but may appoint a guardian ad litem or a

SB 1033 5

112 parent rights to visitation with any minor child born to or
113 adopted by the parties, unless the court finds, after
114 hearing, that visitation would endanger the child's physical
115 health, impair the child's emotional development or would
116 otherwise conflict with the best interests of the child, or
117 that no visitation can be arranged which would sufficiently
118 protect the custodial parent from further domestic
119 violence. The court may appoint a guardian ad litem or
120 court-appointed special advocate to represent the minor
121 child in accordance with chapter 452 whenever the custodial
122 parent alleges that visitation with the noncustodial parent
123 will damage the minor child.
124 [7.] 8. The court shall make an order requiring the
125 noncustodial party to pay an amount reasonable and necessary
126 for the support of any child to whom the party owes a duty
127 of support when no prior order of support is outstanding and
128 after all relevant factors have been considered, in
129 accordance with Missouri supreme court rule 88.01 and
130 chapter 452.
131 [8.] 9. The court may grant a maintenance order to a

137 number or numbers, issue an order, after notice and an
138 opportunity to be heard, directing a wireless service
139 provider to transfer the billing responsibility for and
140 rights to the wireless telephone number or numbers to the
141 petitioner, if the petitioner is not the wireless service

173 and rights to a wireless telephone number or numbers to the
174 petitioner under this subsection by a wireless service
SB 1033 7
175 provider, the petitioner shall assume all financial
176 responsibility for the transferred wireless telephone number
177 or numbers, monthly service costs, and costs for any mobile
178 device associated with the wireless telephone number or
179 numbers.
180 (b) This section shall not preclude a wireless service
181 provider from applying any routine and customary
182 requirements for account establishment to the petitioner as
183 part of this transfer of billing responsibility for a
184 wireless telephone number or numbers and any devices
185 attached to that number or numbers including, but not
186 limited to, identification, financial information, and
