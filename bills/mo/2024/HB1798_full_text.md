20 the grant of rulemaking authority and any rule proposed or adopted after August 28, 2001,
21 shall be invalid and void. No two owners shall be issued identical plates. An owner shall
22 make a new application and pay a new fee each year such owner desires to obtain or retain
23 special personalized license plates; however, notwithstanding the provisions of subsection 8
24 of section 301.130 to the contrary, the director shall allow the special personalized license
25 plates to be replaced with new plates every three years without any additional charge, above
26 the fee established in this section, to the renewal applicant. Any person currently in

28 plate for each of the following years that timely and appropriate application is made.
29 2. Upon application for a personalized plate by the owner of a motor vehicle for

31 301.140, the director shall issue a temporary permit authorizing the operation of the motor
32 vehicle until the personalized plate is issued.
33 3. No personalized license plates shall be issued containing any letters, numbers or
34 combination of letters and numbers which are obscene, profane, patently offensive or
35 contemptuous of a racial or ethnic group, or offensive to good taste or decency, or would
36 present an unreasonable danger to the health or safety of the applicant, of other users of
37 streets and highways, or of the public in any location where the vehicle with such a plate may
38 be found. The director may recall any personalized license plates, including those issued
39 prior to August 28, 1992, if the director determines that the plates are obscene, profane,
40 patently offensive or contemptuous of a racial or ethnic group, or offensive to good taste or
41 decency, or would present an unreasonable danger to the health or safety of the applicant, of
42 other users of streets and highways, or of the public in any location where the vehicle with
43 such a plate may be found. Where the director recalls such plates pursuant to the provisions
44 of this subsection, the director shall reissue personalized license plates to the owner of the
45 motor vehicle for which they were issued at no charge, if the new plates proposed by the
46 owner of the motor vehicle meet the standards established pursuant to this section. The
47 director shall not apply the provisions of this statute in a way that violates the Missouri or
48 United States Constitutions as interpreted by the courts with controlling authority in the state
49 of Missouri. The primary purpose of motor vehicle license plates is to identify motor
50 vehicles. Nothing in the issuance of a personalized license plate creates a designated or
51 limited publicforum. Nothing contained in this subsection shall be interpreted to prohibitthe
52 use of license plates, which are no longer valid for registration purposes, as collector's items
53 or for decorative purposes.

57 license plate from any such category shall pay the same additional fee and make the same

59 such plates in the same manner as other personalized special license plates are issued.
