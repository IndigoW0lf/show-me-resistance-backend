35 the pregnant woman or for which a delay will create a
36 serious risk of substantial and irreversible physical
37 impairment of a major bodily function of the pregnant
38 woman. A "medical emergency" shall include, but not be
39 limited to, an ectopic pregnancy at any point following the

3 2. Notwithstanding any other provision of law to the
4 contrary, no abortion shall be performed or induced upon a
5 woman, except in cases of medical emergency. Any person who
6 knowingly performs or induces an abortion of an unborn child
7 in violation of this subsection shall be guilty of a class B
8 felony, as well as subject to suspension or revocation of
9 his or her professional license by his or her professional
10 licensing board. A woman upon whom an abortion is performed
11 or induced in violation of this subsection shall not be
12 prosecuted for a conspiracy to violate the provisions of
13 this subsection.
14 3. It shall be an affirmative defense for any person
15 alleged to have violated the provisions of subsection 2 of
16 this section that the person performed or induced an
17 abortion because of a medical emergency. The defendant
18 shall have the burden of persuasion that the defense is more
19 probably true than not.
20 4. [The enactment of this section shall only become

25 (1) The United States Supreme Court has overruled, in
26 whole or in part, Roe v. Wade, 410 U.S. 113 (1973),
27 restoring or granting to the state of Missouri the authority
28 to regulate abortion to the extent set forth in this
29 section, and that as a result, it is reasonably probable
30 that this section would be upheld by the court as
31 constitutional;
32 (2) An amendment to the Constitution of the United
33 States has been adopted that has the effect of restoring or
34 granting to the state of Missouri the authority to regulate
35 abortion to the extent set forth in this section; or
36 (3) The United States Congress has enacted a law that
37 has the effect of restoring or granting to the state of
38 Missouri the authority to regulate abortion to the extent
39 set forth in this section] The provisions of this section
40 shall not be construed to impact or prohibit access to other
41 reproductive health care services, including, but not
42 limited to, access to U.S. Food and Drug Administration-
43 approved birth control measures such as hormonal birth
44 control, emergency contraceptives used to prevent pregnancy
45 after sexual intercourse, and long-acting reversible
46 contraceptives, as described in section 208.1070.
