118 have forty-five calendar days to review the completed
119 application for the waiver of geographic proximity. If no
120 action is taken by the boards within forty-five days after
121 the submission of the application for a waiver, then the
122 application shall be deemed approved. If the application is
123 denied by the boards, the provisions of section 536.063 for
124 contested cases shall apply and govern proceedings for
125 appellate purposes; and
126 e. The collaborating physician is required to maintain

SB 807 6
146 registered nurse's delivery of health care services. The

148 practice registered nurse shall submit a minimum of ten
149 percent of the charts documenting the advanced practice
150 registered nurse's delivery of health care services to the
151 collaborating physician for review by the collaborating
152 physician, or any other physician designated in the
153 collaborative practice arrangement, every fourteen days;
154 (10) The collaborating physician, or any other
155 physician designated in the collaborative practice
156 arrangement, shall review every fourteen days a minimum of
157 twenty percent of the charts in which the advanced practice
158 registered nurse prescribes controlled substances. The
159 charts reviewed under this subdivision may be counted in the
160 number of charts required to be reviewed under subdivision
161 (9) of this subsection; and
162 (11) If a collaborative practice arrangement is used
163 in clinical situations where a collaborating advanced
164 practice registered nurse provides health care services that
165 include the diagnosis and initiation of treatment for
166 acutely or chronically ill or injured persons, then the
167 collaborating physician or any other physician designated in
168 the collaborative practice arrangement shall be present for
169 sufficient periods of time, at least once every two weeks,
170 except in extraordinary circumstances that shall be
171 documented, to participate in a chart review and to provide
172 necessary medical direction, medical services,
173 consultations, and supervision of the health care staff.
174 4. The state board of registration for the healing
175 arts pursuant to section 334.125 and the board of nursing
176 pursuant to section 335.036 may jointly promulgate rules
177 regulating the use of collaborative practice arrangements.
SB 807 7
178 Such rules shall be limited to the methods of treatment that
179 may be covered by collaborative practice arrangements and
180 the requirements for review of services provided pursuant to
181 collaborative practice arrangements including delegating
182 authority to prescribe controlled substances. [Any rules
183 relating to geographic proximity shall allow a collaborating
184 physician and a collaborating advanced practice registered
185 nurse to practice within two hundred miles by road of one
186 another until August 28, 2025, if the nurse is providing
187 services in a correctional center, as defined in section
188 217.010.] The state board of registration for the healing
189 arts and the board of nursing shall not promulgate rules to
190 enforce any geographic proximity requirements, including any
191 mileage or distance restrictions for a physician or advanced
192 practice registered nurse, on collaborative practice
193 arrangements between physicians and registered professional
194 nurses located in this state. Any regulations governing
195 proximity that are in effect on August 28, 2024, shall no
196 longer be effective. Any provision of a collaborative
197 practice arrangement that requires geographic proximity
198 between a physician and a registered professional nurse
199 shall be unenforceable. Any rules relating to dispensing or
200 distribution of medications or devices by prescription or
201 prescription drug orders under this section shall be subject
202 to the approval of the state board of pharmacy. Any rules
203 relating to dispensing or distribution of controlled
204 substances by prescription or prescription drug orders under
205 this section shall be subject to the approval of the
206 department of health and senior services and the state board
207 of pharmacy. In order to take effect, such rules shall be
208 approved by a majority vote of a quorum of each board.
209 Neither the state board of registration for the healing arts
SB 807 8
210 nor the board of nursing may separately promulgate rules
211 relating to collaborative practice arrangements. Such
212 jointly promulgated rules shall be consistent with
213 guidelines for federally funded clinics. The rulemaking
214 authority granted in this subsection shall not extend to
215 collaborative practice arrangements of hospital employees
216 providing inpatient care within hospitals as defined
217 pursuant to chapter 197 or population-based public health
218 services as defined by 20 CSR 2150-5.100 as of April 30,
219 2008.
220 5. The state board of registration for the healing
221 arts shall not deny, revoke, suspend or otherwise take
222 disciplinary action against a physician for health care
223 services delegated to a registered professional nurse
224 provided the provisions of this section and the rules
225 promulgated thereunder are satisfied. Upon the written
226 request of a physician subject to a disciplinary action
227 imposed as a result of an agreement between a physician and
228 a registered professional nurse or registered physician
229 assistant, whether written or not, prior to August 28, 1993,
230 all records of such disciplinary licensure action and all
231 records pertaining to the filing, investigation or review of
232 an alleged violation of this chapter incurred as a result of
233 such an agreement shall be removed from the records of the
234 state board of registration for the healing arts and the
235 division of professional registration and shall not be
236 disclosed to any public or private entity seeking such
237 information from the board or the division. The state board
238 of registration for the healing arts shall take action to
239 correct reports of alleged violations and disciplinary
240 actions as described in this section which have been
241 submitted to the National Practitioner Data Bank. In
SB 807 9
242 subsequent applications or representations relating to his
243 or her medical practice, a physician completing forms or
244 documents shall not be required to report any actions of the
245 state board of registration for the healing arts for which
246 the records are subject to removal under this section.
247 6. Within thirty days of any change and on each
248 renewal, the state board of registration for the healing
249 arts shall require every physician to identify whether the
250 physician is engaged in any collaborative practice
251 arrangement, including collaborative practice arrangements
252 delegating the authority to prescribe controlled substances,
253 or physician assistant collaborative practice arrangement
254 and also report to the board the name of each licensed
255 professional with whom the physician has entered into such
256 arrangement. The board shall make this information
257 available to the public. The board shall track the reported
258 information and may routinely conduct random reviews of such
259 arrangements to ensure that arrangements are carried out for
260 compliance under this chapter.
261 7. Notwithstanding any law to the contrary, a
262 certified registered nurse anesthetist as defined in
263 subdivision (8) of section 335.016 shall be permitted to
264 provide anesthesia services without a collaborative practice
265 arrangement provided that he or she is under the supervision
266 of an anesthesiologist or other physician, dentist, or
267 podiatrist who is immediately available if needed. Nothing
268 in this subsection shall be construed to prohibit or prevent
269 a certified registered nurse anesthetist as defined in
270 subdivision (8) of section 335.016 from entering into a
271 collaborative practice arrangement under this section,
272 except that the collaborative practice arrangement may not
273 delegate the authority to prescribe any controlled
SB 807 10
274 substances listed in Schedules III, IV, and V of section
275 195.017, or Schedule II - hydrocodone.
276 8. A collaborating physician shall not enter into a
277 collaborative practice arrangement with more than six full-
278 time equivalent advanced practice registered nurses, full-
279 time equivalent licensed physician assistants, or full-time
280 equivalent assistant physicians, or any combination
281 thereof. This limitation shall not apply to collaborative
282 arrangements of hospital employees providing inpatient care
283 service in hospitals as defined in chapter 197 or population-
284 based public health services as defined by 20 CSR 2150-5.100
285 as of April 30, 2008, or to a certified registered nurse
286 anesthetist providing anesthesia services under the
287 supervision of an anesthesiologist or other physician,
288 dentist, or podiatrist who is immediately available if
289 needed as set out in subsection 7 of this section.
290 9. It is the responsibility of the collaborating
291 physician to determine and document the completion of at
292 least a one-month period of time during which the advanced
293 practice registered nurse shall practice with the
294 collaborating physician continuously present before
295 practicing in a setting where the collaborating physician is
296 not continuously present. This limitation shall not apply
297 to collaborative arrangements of providers of population-
298 based public health services, as defined by 20 CSR 2150-
299 5.100 as of April 30, 2008, or to collaborative practice
300 arrangements between a primary care physician and a primary
301 care advanced practice registered nurse or a behavioral
302 health physician and a behavioral health advanced practice
303 registered nurse, where the collaborating physician is new
304 to a patient population to which the advanced practice
305 registered nurse is familiar.
SB 807 11
306 10. No agreement made under this section shall
307 supersede current hospital licensing regulations governing
308 hospital medication orders under protocols or standing
309 orders for the purpose of delivering inpatient or emergency
310 care within a hospital as defined in section 197.020 if such
311 protocols or standing orders have been approved by the
312 hospital's medical staff and pharmaceutical therapeutics
313 committee.
314 11. No contract or other term of employment shall
315 require a physician to act as a collaborating physician for
316 an advanced practice registered nurse against the
317 physician's will. A physician shall have the right to
318 refuse to act as a collaborating physician, without penalty,
319 for a particular advanced practice registered nurse. No
320 contract or other agreement shall limit the collaborating
321 physician's ultimate authority over any protocols or
322 standing orders or in the delegation of the physician's
323 authority to any advanced practice registered nurse, but
324 this requirement shall not authorize a physician in
325 implementing such protocols, standing orders, or delegation
326 to violate applicable standards for safe medical practice
327 established by hospital's medical staff.
328 12. No contract or other term of employment shall
329 require any advanced practice registered nurse to serve as a
330 collaborating advanced practice registered nurse for any
331 collaborating physician against the advanced practice
332 registered nurse's will. An advanced practice registered
333 nurse shall have the right to refuse to collaborate, without
334 penalty, with a particular physician.
