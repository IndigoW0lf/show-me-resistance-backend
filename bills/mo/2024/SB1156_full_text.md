115 The proceeds of the bond or irrevocable letter of credit
116 furnished by an applicant shall be paid upon receipt by the
117 department of a final judgment from a Missouri court of
118 competent jurisdiction against the principal and in favor of
119 an aggrieved party. The proceeds of the bond or irrevocable
120 letter of credit furnished by an applicant shall be paid at
121 the order of the department and in the amount determined by
122 the department to any buyer or interested lienholder up to
123 the greater of the amount required for the release of the
124 purchase money lien or the sales price paid by the buyer
125 where a dealer has failed to fulfill the dealer's
126 obligations under an agreement to assign and deliver title
127 to the buyer within thirty days under a contract entered
128 into pursuant to subsection 5 of section 301.210. The
129 department shall direct release of the bond or irrevocable
130 letter of credit proceeds upon presentation of a written
131 agreement entered into pursuant to subsection 5 of section
132 301.210, copies of the associated sales and finance
133 documents, and the affidavit or affidavits of the buyer or
134 lienholder stating that the certificate of title with
135 assignment thereof has not been passed to the buyer within
136 thirty days of the date of the contract entered into under
137 subsection 5 of section 301.210, that the dealer has not
138 fulfilled the agreement under the contract to repurchase the
139 vehicle, that the buyer or the lienholder has notified the
140 dealer of the claim on the bond or letter of credit, and the
141 amount claimed by the purchaser or lienholder. In addition,
142 prior to directing release and payment of the proceeds of a
143 bond or irrevocable letter of credit, the department shall
144 ensure that there is satisfactory evidence to establish that
145 the vehicle which is subject to the written agreement has
146 been returned by the buyer to the dealer or that the buyer
SB 1156 6
147 has represented to the department that the buyer will
148 surrender possession of the vehicle to the dealer upon
149 payment of the proceeds of the bond or letter of credit
150 directed by the department. Excepting ordinary wear and
151 tear or mechanical failures not caused by the buyer, the
152 amount of proceeds to be paid to the buyer under the bond or
153 irrevocable letter of credit shall be reduced by an amount
154 equivalent to any damage, abuse, or destruction incurred by
155 the vehicle while the vehicle was in the buyer's possession
156 as agreed between the buyer and the dealer. The dealer may
157 apply to a court of competent jurisdiction to contest the
158 claim on the bond or letter of credit, including the amount
159 of the claim and the amount of any adjustment for any
160 damage, abuse, or destruction, by filing a petition with the
161 court within thirty days of the notification by the buyer or
162 lienholder. If the dealer does not fulfill the agreement or
163 file a petition to request judicial relief from the terms of
164 the agreement or contest the amount of the claim, the bond
165 or letter of credit shall be released by the department and
166 directed paid in the amount or amounts presented by the
167 lienholder or buyer;
168 (4) Payment of all necessary license fees as
169 established by the department. In establishing the amount
170 of the annual license fees, the department shall, as near as
171 possible, produce sufficient total income to offset
172 operational expenses of the department relating to the
173 administration of sections 301.550 to 301.580. All fees
174 payable pursuant to the provisions of sections 301.550 to
175 301.580, other than those fees collected for the issuance of
176 dealer plates or certificates of number collected pursuant
177 to subsection 6 of this section, shall be collected by the
178 department for deposit in the state treasury to the credit
SB 1156 7
179 of the "Motor Vehicle Commission Fund", which is hereby
180 created. The motor vehicle commission fund shall be
181 administered by the Missouri department of revenue. The
182 provisions of section 33.080 to the contrary
183 notwithstanding, money in such fund shall not be transferred
184 and placed to the credit of the general revenue fund until
185 the amount in the motor vehicle commission fund at the end
186 of the biennium exceeds two times the amount of the
187 appropriation from such fund for the preceding fiscal year
188 or, if the department requires permit renewal less
189 frequently than yearly, then three times the appropriation
190 from such fund for the preceding fiscal year. The amount,
191 if any, in the fund which shall lapse is that amount in the
192 fund which exceeds the multiple of the appropriation from
193 such fund for the preceding fiscal year.

195 manufacturer, motor vehicle dealer, wholesale motor vehicle
196 dealer, boat dealer, powersport dealer, wholesale motor

201 decision to grant or deny the license to the applicant
202 within eight working hours after receipt of the dealer's
