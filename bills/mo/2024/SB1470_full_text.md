48 distinct offense, regardless of whether such violations
49 relate to the same incident. In case of a continuing
SB 1470 3
50 violation, each day's continuance thereof shall be a
51 separate and distinct offense.

54 agent, or employee of any corporation, person, public
55 utility, or municipality that owns any gas plant acting

57 every case be considered the act, omission, or failure of
58 such corporation, person, public utility, or municipality
59 that owns any gas plant.
