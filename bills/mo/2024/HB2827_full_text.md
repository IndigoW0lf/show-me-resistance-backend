2 enacted in lieu thereof, to be known as sections 386.266 and 393.1400, to read as follows:
386.266. 1. Subject to the requirements of this section, any electrical corporation
2 may make an application to the commission to approve rate schedules authorizing an interim
3 energy charge, or periodic rate adjustments outside of general rate proceedings to reflect
4 increases and decreases in its prudently incurred fuel and purchased-power costs, including
5 transportation. The commission may, in accordance with existing law, include in such rate
6 schedules features designed to provide the electrical corporation with incentives to improve
7 the efficiency and cost-effectiveness of its fuel and purchased-power procurement activities.
8 2. Subject to the requirements of this section, any electrical, gas, or water corporation
9 may make an application to the commission to approve rate schedules authorizing periodic
10 rate adjustments outside of general rate proceedings to reflect increases and decreases in its
11 prudently incurred costs, whether capital or expense, to comply with any federal, state, or
12 local environmental law, regulation, or rule. Any rate adjustment made under such rate
13 schedules shall not exceed an annual amount equal to two and one-half percent of the
14 electrical, gas, or water corporation's Missouri gross jurisdictional revenues, excluding gross
15 receipts tax, sales tax and other similar pass-through taxes not included in tariffed rates, for
16 regulated services as established in the utility's most recent general rate case or complaint
17 proceeding. In addition to the rate adjustment, the electrical, gas, or water corporation shall

18 be permitted to collect any applicable gross receipts tax, sales tax, or other similar pass-
19 through taxes, and such taxes shall not be counted against the two and one-half percent rate
20 adjustment cap. Any costs not recovered as a result of the annual two and one-half percent
21 limitation on rate adjustments may be deferred, at a carrying cost each month equal to the
22 utilitiesnetoftaxcostofcapital,forrecoveryinasubsequentyearorinthecorporation'snext
23 general rate case or complaint proceeding.
24 3. Subject to the requirements of this section, any gas or electrical corporation may
25 make an application to the commission to approve rate schedules authorizing periodic rate
26 adjustments outside of general rate proceedings to adjust rates of customers in eligible
27 customer classes to account for the impact on utility revenues of increases or decreases in
28 residential and commercial customer usage due to variations in either weather, conservation,
29 or both. For purposes of this section: for electrical corporations, "eligible customer classes"
30 means the residential class and classes that are not demand metered; and forgas corporations,
31 "eligible customer classes" means the residential class and the smallest general service class.
32 As used in this subsection, "revenues" means the revenues recovered through base rates, and
33 does not include revenues collected through a rate adjustment mechanism authorized by this
34 section or any other provisions of law. This subsection shall apply to electrical corporations
35 beginning January 1, 2019[, and shall expire for electrical corporations on January 1, 2029.
36 An electrical corporation may make a one-time application to the commission under this
37 subsection if such corporation has provided notice to the commission under subsection 5 of
38 section 393.1400, provided the corporation shall not concurrently utilize electric rate
39 adjustments under this subsection and the deferrals set forth in subsection 5 of section
40 393.1400].
41 4. Subject to the requirements of this section, a water corporation with more than
42 eight thousand Missouri retail customers may make an application to the commission to
43 approve rate schedules authorizing periodic rate adjustments outside of general rate
44 proceedings to ensure revenues billed by such water corporation for regulated services equal
45 the revenue requirement for regulated services as established in the water corporation's most
46 recent general rate proceeding or complaint proceeding, excluding any other commission-

51 mechanisms submitted under subsections 1 to 4 of this section only after providing the
52 opportunityforafullhearinginageneralrateproceeding,includingageneralrateproceeding
53 initiated by complaint. The commission may approve such rate schedules after considering
HB 2827 3
54 all relevant factors which may affect the costs or overall rates and charges of the corporation,
55 provided that it finds that the adjustment mechanism set forth in the schedules:
56 (1) Isreasonablydesignedtoprovidetheutilitywithasufficientopportunitytoearna
57 fair return on equity;

60 rate, through subsequent rate adjustments or refunds;
61 (3) In the case of an adjustment mechanism submitted under subsections 1 and 2 of
62 this section, includes provisions requiring that the utility file a general rate case with the
63 effective date of new rates to be no later than four years after the effective date of the
64 commission order implementing the adjustment mechanism. However, with respect to each
65 mechanism, the four-year period shall not include any periods in which the utility is
66 prohibited from collecting any charges under the adjustment mechanism, or any period for
67 which charges collected under the adjustment mechanism must be fully refunded. In the
68 event a court determines that the adjustment mechanism is unlawful and all moneys collected
69 thereunder are fully refunded, the utility shall be relieved of any obligation under that
70 adjustment mechanism to file a rate case;
71 (4) In the case of an adjustment mechanism submitted under subsection 1 or 2 of this
72 section, includes provisions for prudence reviews of the costs subject to the adjustment
73 mechanism no less frequently than at eighteen-month intervals, and shall require refund of
74 any imprudently incurred costs plus interest at the utility's short-term borrowing rate.
75 6. Once such an adjustment mechanism is approved by the commission under this
76 section, it shall remain in effect until such time as the commission authorizes the
77 modification, extension, or discontinuance of the mechanism in a general rate case or
78 complaint proceeding.
79 7. Any amounts charged under any adjustment mechanism approved by the
80 commission under this section shall be separately disclosed on each customer bill.
81 8. The commission may take into account any change in business risk to the
82 corporation resulting from implementation of the adjustment mechanism in setting the
83 corporation's allowed return in any rate proceeding, in addition to any other changes in
84 business risk experienced by the corporation.
85 9. In the event the commission lawfully approves an incentive- or performance-based
86 plan, such plan shall be binding on the commission for the entire term of the plan. This

91 promulgate rules under the provisions of chapter 536 as it deems necessary, to govern the
92 structure, content and operation of such rate adjustments, and the procedure for the
93 submission, frequency, examination, hearing and approval of such rate adjustments. Any
94 electrical, gas, or water corporation may apply for any adjustment mechanism under this
95 section whether or not the commission has promulgated any such rules.
96 11. Nothing contained in this section shall be construed as affecting any existing
97 adjustment mechanism, rate schedule, tariff, incentive plan, or other ratemaking mechanism
98 currently approved and in effect.
99 12. Each of the provisions of this section is severable. In the event any provision or
100 subsection of this section is deemed unlawful, all remaining provisions shall remain in effect.

102 Within thirty days of the filing of any capital investment plan or annual update to an existing
103 plan, the electrical corporation shall host a public stakeholder meeting to answer questions
104 and receive feedback about the plan. After feedback is received, the electrical corporation
HB 2827 9
105 shall file a notice with the commission of any modifications to the capital investment plan it
106 has accepted. Changes to the plan, its implementation, or the level of investments made shall
107 not constitute evidence of imprudence of the investments made under such plan. The
108 submission of a capital investment plan under this section shall not affect in any way the
109 commission's authority with respect to the grant or denial of a certificate of convenience and
110 necessity under section 393.170. By February twenty-eighth following each year in which
111 the electrical corporation submits a capital investment plan, the electrical corporation shall
112 submit a report to the commission detailing actual capital investments made the previous
113 year, the quantitatively evaluated benefits and costs generated by each of those investments
114 that exceeded twenty million dollars, and any efficiencies achieved as a result of those
115 investments.
116 5. This section shall only apply to any electrical corporation that has filed a notice
117 with the commission of the electrical corporation's election to make the deferrals for which
118 this section provides. [An electrical corporation may provide notice to the commission one
119 timeunderthissubsectionifsuchcorporationhasappliedtothecommissionundersubsection
120 2 of section 386.266, provided the corporation shall not concurrently utilize deferrals under
121 this subsection and the electric rate adjustments set forth in subsection 3 of section 386.266.]
122 An electrical corporation's election shall allow it to make the deferrals provided for by
123 subsection 2 of this section until December 31, 2028. Notwithstanding the immediately
