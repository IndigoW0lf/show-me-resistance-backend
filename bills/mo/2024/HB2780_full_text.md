11 the provisions that relate primarily to the transaction as a whole do not apply.
12 (b) If the sale-of-goods aspects predominate, this Article applies to the
13 transaction but does not preclude application in appropriate circumstances of other law
14 to aspects of the transaction which do not relate to the sale of goods.
15 (3) This Article does not:
16 (a) Apply to a transaction that, even though in the form of an unconditional
17 contract to sell or present sale, operates only to create a security interest; or
18 (b) Impair or repeal a statute regulating sales to consumers, farmers, or other
19 specified classes of buyers.
400.2-106. (1) In this article unless the context otherwise requires "contract" and
2 "agreement" are limited to those relating to the present or future sale of goods. "Contract for
3 sale" includes both a present sale of goods and a contract to sell goods at a future time. A
4 "sale" consists in the passing of title from the seller to the buyer for a price (section 400.2-
5 401). A "present" means a sale which is accomplished by the making of the contract.
6 (2) Goods or conduct including any part of a performance are "conforming" or

HB 2780 9
8 (3) "Termination" occurs when either party pursuant to a power created by agreement
9 or law puts an end to the contract otherwise than for its breach. On "termination" all
10 obligations which are still executory on both sides are discharged but any right based on prior
11 breach or performance survives.
12 (4) "Cancellation" occurs when either party puts an end to the contract for breach by
13 the other and its effect is the same as that of "termination" except that the cancelling party
14 also retains any remedy for breach of the whole contract or any unperformed balance.
15 (5) "Hybrid transaction" means a single transaction involving a sale of goods
16 and:
17 (a) the provision of services;
18 (b) a lease of other goods; or
19 (c) a sale, lease, or license of property other than goods.
400.2-201. (1) Except as otherwise provided in this section a contract for the sale of
2 goods for the price of five hundred dollars or more is not enforceable by way of action or
3 defense unless there is [some writing] a record sufficient to indicate that a contract for sale
4 has been made between the parties and signed by the party against whom enforcement is
5 sought or by [his] the party's authorized agent or broker. A [writing] record is not
6 insufficient because it omits or incorrectly states a term agreed upon but the contract is not
7 enforceable under this [paragraph] subsection beyond the quantity of goods shown in [such
8 writing] the record.
9 (2) Between merchants if within a reasonable time a [writing] recordin confirmation
10 of the contract and sufficient against the sender is received and the party receiving it has
11 reason to know its contents, it satisfies the requirements of subsection (1) against [such] the
12 party unless [written] notice in a record of objection to its contents is given within ten days
13 after it is received.
14 (3) A contract which does not satisfy the requirements of subsection (1) but which is
15 valid in other respects is enforceable
16 (a) if the goods are to be specially manufactured for the buyer and are notsuitable for
17 sale to others in the ordinary course of the seller's business and the seller, before notice of
18 repudiation is received and under circumstances which reasonably indicate that the goods are
19 for the buyer, has made either a substantial beginning of their manufacture or commitments
20 for their procurement; or
21 (b) if the party against whom enforcement is sought admitsin his pleading, testimony
22 or otherwise in court that a contract for sale was made but the contract is not enforceable
23 under this provision beyond the quantity of goods admitted; or
24 (c) with respect to goods for which payment has been made and accepted or which
25 have been received and accepted (section 400.2-606).
HB 2780 10
400.2-202. Terms with respect to which the confirmatory memoranda of the parties
2 agree or which are otherwise set forth in a [writing] record intended by the parties as a final
3 expression of their agreement with respect to such terms as are included therein may not be
4 contradicted by evidence of any prior agreement or of a contemporaneous oral agreement but
5 may be explained or supplemented
6 (a) by course of dealing or usage of trade (section 400.1-205) or by course of
7 performance (section 400.2-208); and
8 (b) by evidence of consistent additional terms unless the court finds the [writing]
9 record to have been intended also as a complete and exclusive statement of the terms of the
10 agreement.
400.2-203. The affixing of a seal to a [writing] record evidencing a contract for sale
2 or an offer to buy or sell goods does not constitute the [writing] record a sealed instrument
3 and the law with respect to sealed instruments does not apply to such a contract or offer.
400.2-205. An offer by a merchant to buy or sell goods in a signed [writing] record
2 which by its terms gives assurance that it will be held open is not revocable, for lack of
3 consideration, during the time stated or if no time is stated for a reasonable time, but in no
4 event may such period of irrevocability exceed three months; but any such term of assurance
5 on a form supplied by the offeree must be separately signed by the offeror.
400.2-209. (1) An agreement modifying a contract within this article needs no
2 consideration to be binding.
3 (2) A signed agreement which excludes modification or rescission except by a signed
4 writing or other signed record cannot be otherwise modified or rescinded, but except as
5 betweenmerchantssucharequirementonaformsuppliedbythemerchantmustbeseparately
6 signed by the other party.
7 (3) Therequirementsofthestatuteoffraudssectionofthisarticle(section400.2-201)
8 must be satisfied if the contract as modified is within its provisions.
9 (4) Although an attempt at modification or rescission does not satisfy the
10 requirements of subsection (2) or (3) it can operate as a waiver.
11 (5) Apartywhohasmadeawaiveraffectinganexecutoryportionofthecontractmay
12 retract the waiver by reasonable notification received by the other party that strict
13 performance will be required of any term waived, unless the retraction would be unjust in
14 view of a material change of position in reliance on the waiver.

9 subsection (1)(b), whether or not it is specific, if it reasonably identifies what is described.
10 (3) A [writing] record is not insufficient because it omits or incorrectly states a term

7 (ii) the receiving bank is to be reimbursed by debiting an account of, or otherwise
8 receiving payment from, the sender; and
HB 2780 19
9 (iii) the instruction is transmitted by the sender directly to the receiving bank or to an
10 agent, funds-transfer system, or communication system for transmittal to the receiving bank;
11 (2) "Beneficiary" means the person to be paid by the beneficiary's bank;
12 (3) "Beneficiary's bank" means the bank identified in a payment order in which an
13 account of the beneficiary is to be credited pursuant to the order or which otherwise is to
14 make payment to the beneficiary if the order does not provide for payment to an account;
15 (4) "Receiving bank" means the bank to which the sender's instruction is addressed;
16 (5) "Sender" means the person giving the instruction to the receiving bank.
17 (b) If an instruction complying with subsection (a)(1) is to make more than one
18 payment to a beneficiary, the instruction is a separate payment order with respect to each
19 payment.
20 (c) A payment order is issued when it is sent to the receiving bank.
400.4A-201. "Security procedure" means a procedure established by agreement of a
2 customer and a receiving bank for the purpose of (i) verifying that a payment order or
3 communication amending or cancelling a payment order is that of the customer, or (ii)
4 detecting error in the transmission or the content of the payment order or communication. A
5 security procedure may impose an obligation on the receiving bank or the customer and
6 require the use of algorithms or other codes, identifying words [or], numbers, symbols,
7 sounds, biometrics, encryption, callback procedures, or similar security devices.
8 Comparison of a signature on a payment order or communication with an authorized
9 specimensignatureofthecustomerorrequiringapaymentordertobesentfromaknown

2 order of the person identified as sender if that person authorized the order or is otherwise
3 bound by it under the law of agency.

6 procedure, a payment order received by the receiving bank is effective as the order of the
7 customer, whether or not authorized, if (i) the security procedure is a commercially
8 reasonable method of providing security against unauthorized payment orders, and (ii) the
9 bank proves that it accepted the payment order in good faith and in compliance with the
10 bank's obligations under the security procedure and any [written] agreement or instruction
11 of the customer, evidenced by a record, restricting acceptance of payment orders issued in
12 the name of the customer. The bank is not required to follow an instruction that violates [a
13 written] an agreement with the customer, evidenced by a record, or notice of which is not
14 received at a time and in a manner affording the bank a reasonable opportunity to act on it
15 before the payment order is accepted.
HB 2780 20
16 (c) Commercial reasonableness of a security procedure is a question of law to be
17 determined by considering the wishes of the customer expressed to the bank, the
18 circumstances of the customer known to the bank, including the size, type, and frequency
19 of payment orders normally issued by the customer to the bank, alternative security
20 procedures offered to the customer, and security procedures in general use by customers and
21 receiving banks similarly situated. A security procedure is deemed to be commercially
22 reasonable if (i) the security procedure was chosen by the customer after the bank offered,
23 and the customer refused, a security procedure that was commercially reasonable for that
24 customer, and (ii) the customer expressly agreed in [writing] a record to be bound by any
25 payment order, whether or not authorized, issued in its name and accepted by the bank in
26 compliance with the bank's obligations under the security procedure chosen by the
27 customer.
28 (d) The term "sender" in this Article includes the customer in whose name a payment
29 orderisissuediftheorderistheauthorizedorderofthecustomerundersubsection(a),oritis
30 effective as the order of the customer under subsection (b).
31 (e) This section applies to amendments and cancellations of payment orders to the
32 same extent it applies to payment orders.
33 (f) Except as provided in this section and in section 400.4A-203(a)(1), rights and
34 obligations arising under this section or section 400.4A-203 may not be varied by agreement.
400.4A-203. (a) If an accepted payment order is not, under section 400.4A-202(a),
2 an authorized order of a customer identified as sender, but is effective as an order of the
3 customer pursuant to section 400.4A-202(b), the following rules apply:
4 (1) By express [written] agreement evidenced by a record, the receiving bank may
5 limit the extent to which it is entitled to enforce or retain payment of the payment order.
6 (2) The receiving bank is not entitled to enforce or retain payment of the payment
7 order if the customer proves that the order was not caused, directly or indirectly, by a person
8 (i) entrusted at any time with duties to act for the customer with respect to payment orders or
9 thesecurityprocedure,or(ii) whoobtainedaccessto transmittingfacilities ofthecustomer or
10 who obtained, from a source controlled by the customer and without authority of the
11 receiving bank, information facilitating breach of the security procedure, regardless of how
12 the information was obtained or whether the customer was at fault. Information includes any
13 access device, computer software, or the like.
14 (b) This section applies to amendments of payment orders to the same extent it
15 applies to payment orders.
400.4A-207. (a) Subject to subsection (b), if, in a payment order received by the
2 beneficiary's bank, the name, bank account number, or other identification of the beneficiary
HB 2780 21
3 refers to a nonexistent or unidentifiable person or account, no person has rights as a
4 beneficiary of the order and acceptance of the order cannot occur.
5 (b) If a payment order received by the beneficiary's bank identifies the beneficiary
6 both by name and by an identifying or bank account number and the name and number
7 identify different persons, the following rules apply:
8 (1) Except as otherwise provided in subsection 3 of this section, if the beneficiary's
9 bank does not know that the name and number refer to different persons, it may rely on the
10 number as the proper identification of the beneficiary of the order. The beneficiary's bank
11 need not determine whether the name and number refer to the same person.
12 (2) If the beneficiary's bank pays the person identified by name or knows that the
13 name and number identify different persons, no person has rights as beneficiary except the
14 person paid by the beneficiary's bank if that person was entitled to receive payment from the
15 originatorof the fundstransfer. If no personhasrights asbeneficiary, acceptanceof theorder
16 cannot occur.
17 (c) If (i) a payment order described in subsection (b) is accepted, (ii) the originator's
18 payment order described the beneficiary inconsistently by name and number, and (iii) the
19 beneficiary'sbankpaysthepersonidentifiedbynumberaspermittedbysubsection(b)(1),the
20 following rules apply:
21 (1) If the originator is a bank, the originator is obliged to pay its order.
22 (2) Ifthe originatorisnota bankandprovesthatthepersonidentifiedby numberwas
23 not entitled to receive payment from the originator, the originator is not obliged to pay its
24 order unless the originator's bank proves that the originator, before acceptance of the
25 originator's order, had notice that payment of a payment order issued by the originator might
26 bemadebythebeneficiary'sbankonthebasisofanidentifyingorbankaccountnumbereven
27 ifit identifiesapersondifferentfromthe namedbeneficiary. Proofofnoticemaybemadeby
28 any admissible evidence. The originator's bank satisfies the burden of proof if it proves that
29 the originator, before the payment order was accepted, signed a [writing] record stating the
30 information to which the notice relates.
31 (d) In a case governed by subsection (b)(1), if the beneficiary's bank rightfully pays
32 the person identified by number and that person was not entitled to receive payment from the
33 originator, the amount paid may be recovered from that person to the extent allowed by the
34 law governing mistake and restitution as follows:
35 (1) If the originator is obliged to pay its payment order as stated in subsection (c), the
36 originator has the right to recover;
37 (2) If the originator is not a bank and is not obliged to pay its payment order, the
38 originator's bank has the right to recover.
HB 2780 22
400.4A-208. (a) This subsection applies to a payment order identifying an
2 intermediary bank or the beneficiary's bank only by an identifying number:
3 (1) The receiving bank may rely on the number as the proper identification of the
4 intermediary or beneficiary's bank and need not determine whether the number identifies a
5 bank.
6 (2) The sender is obliged to compensate the receiving bank for any loss and expenses
7 incurred by the receiving bank as a result of its reliance on the number in executing or
8 attempting to execute the order.
9 (b) Thissubsectionappliestoapaymentorderidentifyinganintermediarybankorthe
10 beneficiary's bank both by name and an identifying number if the name and number identify
11 different persons.
12 (1) If the sender is a bank, the receiving bank may rely on the number as the proper
13 identificationofthe intermediaryorbeneficiary's bankifthe receivingbank,when itexecutes
14 the sender's order, does not know that the name and number identify different persons. The
15 receiving bank need not determine whether the name and number refer to the same person or
16 whether the number refers to a bank. The sender is obliged to compensate the receiving bank
17 for any loss and expenses incurred by the receiving bank as a result of its reliance on the
18 number in executing or attempting to execute the order.
19 (2) If the sender is not a bank and the receiving bank proves that the sender, before
20 the payment order was accepted, had notice that the receiving bank might rely on the number
21 as the proper identification of the intermediary or beneficiary's bank even if it identifies a
22 persondifferentfromthebankidentifiedbyname,therightsandobligationsofthesenderand
23 thereceivingbankaregovernedbysubsection(b)(1),asthoughthesenderwereabank.Proof
24 of notice may be made by any admissible evidence. The receiving bank satisfies the burden
25 ofproofifitprovesthatthesender,beforethepaymentorderwasaccepted,signeda[writing]
26 record stating the information to which the notice relates.
27 (3) Regardless of whether the sender is a bank, the receiving bank may rely on the
28 name as the proper identification of the intermediary or beneficiary's bank if the receiving
29 bank, at the time it executes the sender's order, does not know that the name and number
30 identify different persons. The receiving bank need not determine whether the name and
31 number refer to the same person.
32 (4) If the receiving bank knows that the name and number identify different persons,
33 reliance on either the name or the number in executing the sender's payment order is a breach
34 of the obligation stated in section 400.4A-302(a)(1).
400.4A-210. (a) A payment order is rejected by the receiving bank by a notice of
2 rejection transmitted to the sender orally[, electronically,] or in [writing] a record. A notice
3 ofrejectionneednotuseanyparticularwordsandissufficientifitindicatesthatthereceiving
HB 2780 23
4 bank is rejecting the order or will not execute or pay the order. Rejection is effective when
5 the notice is given if transmission is by a means that is reasonable in the circumstances. If
6 notice of rejection is given by a means that is not reasonable, rejection is effective when the
7 notice is received. If an agreement of the sender and receiving bank establishes the means to
8 be used to reject a payment order, (i) any means complying with the agreement is reasonable
9 and (ii) any means not complying is not reasonable unless no significant delay in receipt of
10 the notice resulted from the use of the noncomplying means.
11 (b) This subsection applies if a receiving bank other than the beneficiary's bank fails
12 to execute a payment order despite the existence on the execution date of a withdrawable
13 credit balance in an authorized account of the sender sufficient to cover the order. If the
14 sender does not receive notice of rejection of the order on the execution date and the
15 authorized account of the sender does not bear interest, the bank is obliged to pay interest to
16 thesenderonthe amountofthe orderfor thenumberofdays elapsingafter theexecutiondate
17 to the earlier of the day the order is cancelled pursuant to section 400.4A-211(d) or the day
18 the sender receives notice or learns that the order was not executed, counting the final day of
19 theperiodasanelapsedday. Ifthewithdrawablecreditbalanceduringthatperiodfallsbelow
20 the amount of the order, the amount of interest is reduced accordingly.
21 (c) If a receiving bank suspends payments, all unaccepted payment orders issued to it
22 are deemed rejected at the time the bank suspends payments.
23 (d) Acceptance of a payment order precludes a later rejection of the order. Rejection
24 of a payment order precludes a later acceptance of the order.
400.4A-211. (a) A communication of the sender of a payment order cancelling or
2 amending the order may be transmitted to the receiving bank orally[, electronically,] or in
3 [writing] a record. If a security procedure is in effect between the sender and the receiving
4 bank, the communication is not effective to cancel or amend the order unless the
5 communication is verified pursuant to the security procedure or the bank agrees to the
6 cancellation or amendment.
7 (b) Subject to subsection (a), a communication by the sender cancelling or amending
8 a payment order is effective to cancel or amend the order if notice of the communication is
9 received at a time and in a manner affording the receiving bank a reasonable opportunity to
10 act on the communication before the bank accepts the payment order.
11 (c) After a payment order has been accepted, cancellation or amendment of the order
12 is not effective unless the receiving bank agrees or a funds-transfer system rule allows
13 cancellation or amendment without agreement of the bank.
14 (1) With respect to a payment order accepted by a receiving bank other than the
15 beneficiary's bank, cancellation or amendment is not effective unless a conforming
16 cancellation or amendment of the payment order issued by the receiving bank is also made.
HB 2780 24
17 (2) With respect to a payment order accepted by the beneficiary's bank, cancellation
18 or amendment is not effective unless the order was issued in execution of an unauthorized
19 payment order, or because of a mistake by a sender in the funds transfer which resulted in the
20 issuanceof a payment order (i) thatis a duplicate of a payment order previously issuedby the
21 sender, (ii) that orders payment to a beneficiary not entitled to receive payment from the
22 originator, or (iii) that orders payment in an amount greater than the amount the beneficiary
23 was entitled to receive from the originator. If the payment order is cancelled or amended, the
24 beneficiary's bank is entitled to recover from the beneficiary any amount paid to the
25 beneficiary to the extent allowed by the law governing mistake and restitution.
26 (d) An unaccepted payment order is cancelled by operation of law at the close of the
27 fifth funds-transfer business day of the receiving bank after the execution date or payment
28 date of the order.
29 (e) A cancelled payment order cannot be accepted. If an accepted payment order is
30 cancelled, the acceptance is nullified and no person has any right or obligation based on the
31 acceptance. Amendment of a payment order is deemed to be cancellation of the original
32 order at the time of amendment and issue of a new payment order in the amended form at the
33 same time.
34 (f) Unless otherwise provided in an agreement of the parties or in a funds-transfer
35 system rule, if the receiving bank, after accepting a payment order, agrees to cancellation or
36 amendment of the order by the sender or is bound by a funds-transfer system rule allowing
37 cancellation or amendment without the bank's agreement, the sender, whether or not
38 cancellation or amendment is effective, is liable to the bank for any loss and expenses,
39 including reasonable attorney's fees, incurred by the bank as a result of the cancellation or
40 amendment or attempted cancellation or amendment.
41 (g) A payment order is not revoked by the death or legal incapacity of the sender
42 unless the receiving bank knows of the death or of an adjudication of incapacity by a court of
43 competent jurisdiction and has reasonable opportunity to act before acceptance of the order.
44 (h) A funds-transfer system rule is not effective to the extent it conflicts with
45 subsection (c)(2).
400.4A-305. (a) If a funds transfer is completed but execution of a payment order by
2 the receiving bank in breach of section 400.4A-302 results in delay in payment to the
3 beneficiary, thebank isobligedto payinterestto eitherthe originatororthe beneficiaryofthe
4 funds transfer for the period of delay caused by the improper execution. Except as provided
5 in subsection (c), additional damages are not recoverable.
6 (b) If execution of a payment order by a receiving bank in breach of section 400.4A-
7 302 results in (i) noncompletion of the funds transfer, (ii) failure to use an intermediary bank
8 designated by the originator, or (iii) issuance of a payment order that does not comply with
HB 2780 25
9 the terms of the payment order of the originator, the bank is liable to the originator for its
10 expensesinthefundstransferandforincidentalexpensesandinterestlosses,totheextentnot
11 covered by subsection (a), resulting from the improper execution. Except as provided in
12 subsection (c), additional damages are not recoverable.
13 (c) In addition to the amounts payable under subsections (a) and (b), damages,
14 including consequential damages, are recoverable to the extent provided in an express
15 [written] agreement of the receiving bank, evidenced by a record.
16 (d) If a receiving bank fails to execute a payment order it was obliged by express
17 agreement to execute, the receiving bank is liable to the sender for its expenses in the
18 transaction and for incidental expenses and interest losses resulting from the failure to
19 execute. Additional damages, including consequential damages, are recoverable to the extent
20 providedinan express[written]agreementofthereceivingbank,evidencedbyarecord, but
21 are not otherwise recoverable.
22 (e) Reasonable attorney's fees are recoverable if demand for compensation under
23 subsection (a) or (b) is made and refused before an action is brought on the claim. If a claim
24 is made for breach of an agreement under subsection (d) and the agreement does not provide
25 for damages, reasonable attorney's fees are recoverable if demand for compensation under
26 subsection (d) is made and refused before an action is brought on the claim.
27 (f) Except as stated in this section, the liability of a receiving bank under subsections
28 (a) and (b) may not be varied by agreement.
400.5-104. A letter of credit, confirmation, advice, transfer, amendment or
2 cancellation may be issued in any form that is a signed record [and is authenticated:
