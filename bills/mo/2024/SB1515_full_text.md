AN ACT
To amend chapter 590, RSMo, by adding thereto one new section relating to a pilot program for
veterans and first responders.
Be it enacted by the General Assembly of the State of Missouri, as follows:
1 Section A. Chapter 590, RSMo, is amended by adding thereto
2 one new section, to be known as section 590.900, to read as
3 follows:
1 590.900. 1. As used in this section, the following
2 terms mean:
3 (1) "Electroencephalogram combined transcranial
4 magnetic stimulation (eTMS)", treatment in which
5 transcranial magnetic stimulation frequency pulses are tuned
6 to the patient's physiology and biometric data;
7 (2) "Quality of life issues", issues affecting human
8 performance, including issues related to or resulting from
9 problems with cognition and problems maintaining attention,
10 concentration, or focus.
11 2. The department of public safety shall establish a
12 pilot program to make electroencephalogram combined
13 transcranial magnetic stimulation (eTMS) available for
14 veterans, federal agents, first responders as defined by 34
15 U.S.C. Section 10705 with substance use disorders, mental
16 illness, sleep disorders, traumatic brain injuries, sexual
17 trauma, post-traumatic stress disorder, and accompanying
SB 1515 2
18 comorbidities, concussions, other brain trauma, or other
19 quality of life issues.
20 3. The department shall choose a primary location for
21 the pilot program and shall choose additional locations for
22 up to ten branch sites and shall enter into a contract for
23 the purchase of services related to the pilot program. A
24 branch site may be a mobile unit or an eTMS combined
25 neuromodulation portable unit if the department determines
26 that mobile units or EEG combined neuromodulation portable
27 units are necessary to expand access to care. The contract
28 shall include provisions requiring the provider to establish
29 and operate a clinical practice, to evaluate outcomes of the
30 clinical trial and clinical practice, to expend payments
31 appropriated by the general assembly as needed for purposes
32 of the program, and to submit an annual report by December
33 thirty-first of each year regarding the pilot program to the
34 general assembly. If money is appropriated for the pilot
35 program, the provider contracted by the department shall
36 appear before a standing committee of the Missouri house of
37 representatives and senate dealing with veterans affairs.
38 4. The department shall adopt rules for the pilot
39 program which shall include:
40 (1) Adherence to the U.S. Food and Drug Administration
41 regulations governing the conduct of clinical practice;
42 (2) Peer-to-peer support network established and made
43 available by the provider to any individual receiving
44 treatment under the program;
45 (3) Establishment of protocols which include the use
46 of adopted stimulation frequency and intensity modulation
47 based on eTMS and motor threshold testing, as well as
48 clinical symptoms and signs and biometrics;
SB 1515 3
49 (4) Requirement that each individual who receives
50 treatment under this pilot program shall also receive pre-
51 and post-treatment neurophysiological monitoring, with eTMS
52 and autonomic nervous systems assessments, weekly checklists
53 of symptoms of alcohol, opioid, or other substance use, and
54 biweekly medical counseling and optional wellness
55 programming, and also shall participate in the peer-to-peer
56 support network established by the provider;
57 (5) Requirement that protocols and outcomes of any
58 treatment provided by the clinical practice shall be
59 collected and a report shall be submitted annually by the
60 provider to the general assembly; and
61 (6) Requirement that the report submitted to the
62 general assembly include all expenditures and accounting of
63 the use of funds received from any appropriations made to
64 the fund.
65 5. Any rule or portion of a rule, as that term is
66 defined in section 536.010, that is created under the
67 authority delegated in this section shall become effective
68 only if it complies with and is subject to all of the
69 provisions of chapter 536 and, if applicable, section
70 536.028. This section and chapter 536 are nonseverable and
71 if any of the powers vested with the general assembly
72 pursuant to chapter 536 to review, to delay the effective
73 date, or to disapprove and annul a rule are subsequently
74 held unconstitutional, then the grant of rulemaking
75 authority and any rule proposed or adopted after August 28,
76 2024, shall be invalid and void.
77 6. (1) There is hereby established in the state
78 treasury the "Electroencephalogram Combined Transcranial
79 Magnetic Stimulation Fund". The pilot program established
80 pursuant to this section shall be funded by moneys from this
SB 1515 4
81 fund. The fund may receive any grants, gifts, donations, or
82 appropriations for the purpose of establishing and operating
83 this program. The state treasurer shall be custodian of the
84 fund. In accordance with sections 30.170 and 30.180, the
85 state treasurer may approve disbursements.
86 (2) Notwithstanding the provisions of section 33.080
87 to the contrary, any moneys remaining in the fund at the end
88 of the biennium shall not revert to the credit of the
89 general revenue fund.
90 (3) The state treasurer shall invest moneys in the
91 fund in the same manner as other funds are invested. Any
92 interest and moneys earned on such investments shall be
93 credited to the fund.
