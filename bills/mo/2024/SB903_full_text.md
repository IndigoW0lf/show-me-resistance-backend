SB 903 3
49 3. Such [time-limited] settlement demand shall be
50 accompanied by:
51 (1) A list of the names and addresses of health care
52 providers who provided treatment to or evaluation of the
53 claimant or decedent for injuries suffered from the date of
54 injury until the date of the [time-limited] settlement
55 demand, and HIPAA compliant written authorizations
56 sufficient to allow the liability insurer to obtain such
57 records from the health care providers listed; and
58 (2) A list of the names and addresses of all the
59 claimant's employers at the time the claimant was first
60 injured until the date of the [time-limited] settlement
61 demand, and written authorizations sufficient to allow the
62 liability insurer to obtain such records from all employers
63 listed, if the claimant asserts a loss of wages, earnings,
64 compensation, or profits however denominated.
65 4. If a liability insurer with the right to settle on
66 behalf of an insured receives a [time-limited] settlement
67 demand, such insurer may accept the [time-limited]
68 settlement demand by providing written acceptance of the
69 material terms outlined in subsection 2 of this section,
70 delivered or postmarked to the claimant or the claimant's
71 representative within the time period [set in the time-
72 limited demand] in which the settlement demand is open for
73 acceptance by the liability insurer, which in no event shall
74 be less than ninety days.
75 5. Nothing in this section shall prohibit a claimant
76 making a [time-limited] settlement demand from requiring
77 payment within a specified period; provided, however, that
78 such period for payment shall not be less than ten days
79 after the insurer's receipt of a fully executed
SB 903 4
80 unconditional release under section 537.060 as specified in
81 subsection 2 of this section.
82 6. Nothing in this section applies to offers or
83 demands or [time-limited] settlement demands issued within
84 ninety days of the trial by jury of any claim on which a
85 lawsuit has been filed.
86 7. In any lawsuit filed by a claimant as an assignee
87 of the tort-feasor or by the tort-feasor for the benefit of
88 the claimant, a [time-limited] settlement demand that does
89 not comply with the terms of this section shall not be
90 considered as a reasonable opportunity to settle for the
91 insurer and shall not be admissible in any lawsuit alleging
92 extracontractual damages against the tort-feasor's liability
93 insurer.
