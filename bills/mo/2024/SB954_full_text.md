1 700.203. 1. All manufacturers and dealers doing
2 business in this state must have a written agreement signed
3 by both parties.
4 2. The manufacturer shall designate in writing subject
5 to annual review the area of sales responsibility
6 exclusively assigned to a dealer and shall not establish
7 another dealer for the same line-make in the same area
8 during the duration of the agreement unless the manufacturer
9 can show good cause for the addition of the new dealer,
10 including reasonable evidence that the market will support
11 the establishment of a new dealership.
12 3. Sales of manufactured homes or modular units by
13 manufacturers or distributors shall be in accordance with
14 published prices, charges, and terms of sale in effect at
15 any given time. The manufacturer shall sell products on the
16 same basis, with respect to all rebates, discounts, and
17 programs, to all competing dealers similarly situated.
18 4. No manufacturer, directly or through any officer,
19 agent, or employee, may terminate a dealer agreement without
20 good cause. The burden of showing good cause is on the
21 manufacturer. Prior to the expiration of a dealer
22 agreement, both parties shall enter into negotiations for
23 renewal of the dealer agreement in good faith, and neither
24 will arbitrarily require a substantial change in competitive
25 circumstances. When taking on a competing manufacturer's
26 lines, a dealer shall notify existing manufacturers in
27 writing, at least thirty days prior to entering into such an
28 agreement, to sell the same type of manufactured home or
29 modular unit.
1 700.206. 1. Except as provided in this section, a
2 manufacturer shall provide a dealer at least one hundred
3 twenty days prior written notice of termination. The notice
SB 954 6
4 shall state all the reasons for termination and shall
5 further state that if, within thirty days following receipt
6 of the manufacturer's notice, the dealer provides to the
7 manufacturer a written notice of intent to cure all claimed
8 deficiencies, the dealer will then have one hundred twenty
9 days from the date of the manufacturer's notice to rectify
10 such deficiencies. If the deficiency is rectified within
11 one hundred twenty days, the manufacturer's notice shall be
12 void. However, if the dealer fails to provide the notice of
13 intent to cure deficiencies in the prescribed time period,
14 the termination shall take effect thirty days after the
15 dealer's receipt of the manufacturer's notice unless the
16 dealer has new and untitled inventory on hand in which case,
17 if requested by the dealer, it shall take effect upon the
18 sale of the remaining inventory but in no event later than
19 one hundred twenty days from the manufacturer's notice of
20 termination.
21 2. The one hundred twenty day-notice may be reduced to
22 thirty days' notice if the grounds for termination are due
23 to:
24 (1) Conviction of or pleas of nolo contendere to a
25 felony of a dealer, or one of its owners;
26 (2) The business operations of the dealer have been
27 abandoned or closed for ten consecutive business days unless
28 the closing is due to an act of God, strike or labor
29 difficulty, or other cause over which the dealer has no
30 control;
31 (3) A material misrepresentation by the dealer; or
32 (4) The suspension, revocation, or refusal to renew
33 the dealer's license.
34 3. The notice provisions of this section shall not
35 apply if the reason for termination is insolvency, the
SB 954 7
36 occurrence of an assignment for the benefit of creditors, or
37 bankruptcy.
38 4. A dealer may terminate its dealer agreement at any
39 time by giving written notice of such intention to the
40 manufacturer at least thirty days prior to the effective
41 date specified for termination.
1 700.209. If the dealer agreement is terminated,
2 cancelled, or not renewed by the manufacturer for cause, or
3 if the dealer voluntarily terminates a dealer agreement in a
4 manner permitted by such agreement, or if the manufacturer
5 terminates or discontinues a franchise by discontinuing a
6 line-make or by ceasing to do business in this state, or if
7 the manufacturer changes the distributor or method of
8 distribution of its products in this state or alters its
9 sales regions or marketing areas within this state in a
10 manner that eliminates or diminishes the dealer's market
11 area, the manufacturer shall, at the election of the dealer,
12 within thirty days of termination, repurchase:
13 (1) All new, untitled recreation vehicle inventory,
14 acquired from the manufacturer in the previous eighteen
15 months, which has not been altered or damaged to the extent
16 that such damage must be disclosed to the consumer pursuant
17 to section 700.213, at one hundred percent of the net
18 invoice cost, including transportation, less applicable
19 rebates and discounts to the dealer;
20 (2) All current and undamaged manufacturer's
21 accessories and proprietary parts sold to the dealer for
22 resale, if accompanied by the original invoice, at one
23 hundred five percent of the original net price paid to the
24 manufacturer to compensate the dealer for handling, packing,
25 and shipping the parts; and
SB 954 8
26 (3) Any fully and correctly functioning diagnostic
27 equipment, special tools, current signage, and other
28 equipment and machinery, at one hundred percent of the
29 dealer's net cost plus freight, destination, delivery, and
30 distribution charges and sales taxes, if any, provided it
31 was purchased by the dealer within five years before
32 termination and upon the manufacturer's request and can no
33 longer be used in the normal course of the dealer's ongoing
34 business.
35 The manufacturer shall pay the dealer within thirty days of
36 receipt of all items returned for repurchase under this
37 section.
1 700.213. 1. On any new manufactured home or modular
2 unit, any uncorrected, significant damage, or any corrected
3 damage exceeding five hundred dollars or ten percent of the
4 dealer's invoice, whichever is greater, shall be disclosed
5 to the dealer in writing prior to delivery. The dealer is
6 responsible for disclosing such damage to the consumer in
7 writing and shall obtain a written acknowledgment of such
8 damage from the consumer. A copy of the consumer's
9 acknowledgment shall be provided to the manufacturer.
10 Factory or dealer repairs to glass, tires, wheels, bumpers,
11 audio/video equipment, in-dash components, instrument
12 panels, decorating items, appliances, furniture, and
13 components are excluded from disclosure when properly
14 replaced by substantially similar manufacturer's or
15 distributor's original equipment, materials, or parts.
16 2. Whenever a new manufactured home or modular unit is
17 damaged prior to transit to the dealer, or is damaged in
18 transit to the dealer when the carrier or means of
SB 954 9
19 transportation has been determined by the manufacturer or
20 distributor, the dealer shall:
21 (1) Notify the manufacturer or distributor of such
22 damage by the next business day after the date of delivery
23 of such new manufactured home or modular unit to the
24 dealership or within such additional time as specified in
25 the manufacturer/dealer agreement; and
26 (2) Either:
27 (a) Request from the manufacturer or distributor
28 authorization to replace the components, parts, and
29 accessories damaged or otherwise correct the damage; or
30 (b) Reject the vehicle by the next business day after
31 delivery.
32 3. If the manufacturer or distributor refuses or fails
33 to authorize repair of such damage within ten days after
34 receipt of notification, or if the dealer rejects the
35 manufactured home or modular unit because of damage,
36 ownership of the new manufactured home or modular unit shall
37 revert to the manufacturer or distributor. The dealer shall
38 exercise due care in custody, but the dealer shall have no
39 other obligations, financial or otherwise, with respect to
40 such manufactured home or modular unit.
