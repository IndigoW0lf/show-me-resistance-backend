JOINT RESOLUTION
Submitting to the qualified voters of Missouri, an amendment repealing section 6 of article X of
the Constitution of Missouri, and adopting one new section in lieu thereof relating to a
property tax exemption for certain senior citizens.
Be it resolved by the Senate, the House of Representatives concurring therein:
1 That at the next general election to be held in the
2 state of Missouri, on Tuesday next following the first Monday
3 in November, 2024, or at a special election to be called by
4 the governor for that purpose, there is hereby submitted to
5 the qualified voters of this state, for adoption or
6 rejection, the following amendment to article X of the
7 Constitution of the state of Missouri:
1 Section A. Section 6, article X, Constitution of Missouri,
2 is repealed and one new section adopted in lieu thereof, to be
3 known as section 6, to read as follows:
1 Section 6. 1. All property, real and personal, of the
2 state, counties and other political subdivisions, and
3 nonprofit cemeteries, and all real property used as a
4 homestead as defined by law of any citizen of this state who
5 is a former prisoner of war, as defined by law, and who has
6 a total service-connected disability, shall be exempt from
7 taxation; all property, real and personal, of citizens of
8 this state who are aged sixty-five or older shall be exempt
9 from taxation; all personal property held as industrial
10 inventories, including raw materials, work in progress and
SJR 66 2
11 finished work on hand, by manufacturers and refiners, and
12 all personal property held as goods, wares, merchandise,
13 stock in trade or inventory for resale by distributors,
14 wholesalers, or retail merchants or establishments shall be
15 exempt from taxation; and all property, real and personal,
16 not held for private or corporate profit and used
17 exclusively for religious worship, for schools and colleges,
18 for purposes purely charitable, for agricultural and
19 horticultural societies, or for veterans' organizations may
20 be exempted from taxation by general law. In addition to
21 the above, household goods, furniture, wearing apparel and
22 articles of personal use and adornment owned and used by a
23 person in his home or dwelling place may be exempt from
24 taxation by general law but any such law may provide for
25 approximate restitution to the respective political
26 subdivisions of revenues lost by reason of the exemption.
27 All laws exempting from taxation property other than the
28 property enumerated in this article, shall be void. The
29 provisions of this section exempting certain personal
30 property of manufacturers, refiners, distributors,
31 wholesalers, and retail merchants and establishments from
32 taxation shall become effective, unless otherwise provided
33 by law, in each county on January 1 of the year in which
34 that county completes its first general reassessment as
35 defined by law.
36 2. All revenues lost because of the exemption of
37 certain personal property of manufacturers, refiners,
38 distributors, wholesalers, and retail merchants and
39 establishments shall be replaced to each taxing authority
40 within a county from a countywide tax hereby imposed on all
41 property in subclass 3 of class 1 in each county. For the
42 year in which the exemption becomes effective, the county
SJR 66 3
43 clerk shall calculate the total revenue lost by all taxing
44 authorities in the county and extend upon all property in
45 subclass 3 of class 1 within the county, a tax at the rate
46 necessary to produce that amount. The rate of tax levied in
47 each county according to this subsection shall not be
48 increased above the rate first imposed and will stand levied
49 at that rate unless later reduced according to the
50 provisions of subsection 3. The county collector shall
51 disburse the proceeds according to the revenue lost by each
52 taxing authority because of the exemption of such property
53 in that county. Restitution of the revenues lost by any
54 taxing district contained in more than one county shall be
55 from the several counties according to the revenue lost
56 because of the exemption of property in each county. Each
57 year after the first year the replacement tax is imposed,
58 the amount distributed to each taxing authority in a county
59 shall be increased or decreased by an amount equal to the
60 amount resulting from the change in that district's total
61 assessed value of property in subclass 3 of class 1 at the
62 countywide replacement tax rate. In order to implement the
63 provisions of this subsection, the limits set in section
64 11(b) of this article may be exceeded, without voter
65 approval, if necessary to allow each county listed in
66 section 11(b) to comply with this subsection.
67 3. Any increase in the tax rate imposed pursuant to
68 subsection 2 of this section shall be decreased if such
69 decrease is approved by a majority of the voters of the
70 county voting on such decrease. A decrease in the increased
71 tax rate imposed under subsection 2 of this section may be
72 submitted to the voters of a county by the governing body
73 thereof upon its own order, ordinance, or resolution and
74 shall be submitted upon the petition of at least eight
SJR 66 4
75 percent of the qualified voters who voted in the immediately
76 preceding gubernatorial election.
77 4. As used in this section, the terms "revenues lost"
78 and "lost revenues" shall mean that revenue which each
79 taxing authority received from the imposition of a tangible
80 personal property tax on all personal property held as
81 industrial inventories, including raw materials, work in
82 progress and finished work on hand, by manufacturers and
83 refiners, and all personal property held as goods, wares,
84 merchandise, stock in trade or inventory for resale by
85 distributors, wholesalers, or retail merchants or
86 establishments in the last full tax year immediately
87 preceding the effective date of the exemption from taxation
88 granted for such property under subsection 1 of this
89 section, and which was no longer received after such
90 exemption became effective.
