82 (3) Every applicant as a new motor vehicle franchise
83 dealer, a used motor vehicle dealer, a powersport dealer, a
84 wholesale motor vehicle dealer, trailer dealer, or boat
85 dealer shall furnish with the application a corporate surety
86 bond or an irrevocable letter of credit as defined in
87 section 400.5-102, issued by any state or federal financial
88 institution in the penal sum of fifty thousand dollars on a

93 dealers, powersport dealers, wholesale motor vehicle
94 dealers, trailer dealers, and boat dealers, and the bond

99 state of Missouri for the benefit of all aggrieved parties
100 or the irrevocable letter of credit shall name the state of

110 The proceeds of the bond or irrevocable letter of credit

112 department of a final judgment from a Missouri court of
113 competent jurisdiction against the principal and in favor of
SB 1016 5
114 an aggrieved party. The proceeds of the bond or irrevocable
115 letter of credit furnished by an applicant shall be paid at
116 the order of the department and in the amount determined by
117 the department to any buyer or interested lienholder up to
118 the greater of the amount required for the release of the
119 purchase money lien or the sales price paid by the buyer
120 where a dealer has failed to fulfill the dealer's
121 obligations under an agreement to assign and deliver title
122 to the buyer within thirty days under a contract entered
123 into pursuant to subsection 5 of section 301.210. The
124 department shall direct release of the bond or irrevocable
125 letter of credit proceeds upon presentation of a written
126 agreement entered into pursuant to subsection 5 of section
127 301.210, copies of the associated sales and finance
128 documents, and the affidavit or affidavits of the buyer or
129 lienholder stating that the certificate of title with
130 assignment thereof has not been passed to the buyer within
131 thirty days of the date of the contract entered into under
132 subsection 5 of section 301.210, that the dealer has not
133 fulfilled the agreement under the contract to repurchase the
134 vehicle, that the buyer or the lienholder has notified the
135 dealer of the claim on the bond or letter of credit, and the
136 amount claimed by the purchaser or lienholder. In addition,
137 prior to directing release and payment of the proceeds of a
138 bond or irrevocable letter of credit, the department shall
139 ensure that there is satisfactory evidence to establish that
140 the vehicle which is subject to the written agreement has
141 been returned by the buyer to the dealer or that the buyer
142 has represented to the department that the buyer will
143 surrender possession of the vehicle to the dealer upon
144 payment of the proceeds of the bond or letter of credit
145 directed by the department. Excepting ordinary wear and
SB 1016 6
146 tear or mechanical failures not caused by the buyer, the
147 amount of proceeds to be paid to the buyer under the bond or
148 irrevocable letter of credit shall be reduced by an amount
149 equivalent to any damage, abuse, or destruction incurred by
150 the vehicle while the vehicle was in the buyer's possession
151 as agreed between the buyer and the dealer. The dealer may
152 apply to a court of competent jurisdiction to contest the
153 claim on the bond or letter of credit, including the amount
154 of the claim and the amount of any adjustment for any
155 damage, abuse, or destruction, by filing a petition with the
156 court within thirty days of the notification by the buyer or
157 lienholder. If the dealer does not fulfill the agreement or
158 file a petition to request judicial relief from the terms of
159 the agreement or contest the amount of the claim, the bond
160 or letter of credit shall be released by the department and
161 directed paid in the amount or amounts presented by the
162 lienholder or buyer;
163 (4) Payment of all necessary license fees as
164 established by the department. In establishing the amount
165 of the annual license fees, the department shall, as near as
166 possible, produce sufficient total income to offset
167 operational expenses of the department relating to the
168 administration of sections 301.550 to 301.580. All fees
169 payable pursuant to the provisions of sections 301.550 to
170 301.580, other than those fees collected for the issuance of
171 dealer plates or certificates of number collected pursuant
172 to subsection 6 of this section, shall be collected by the
173 department for deposit in the state treasury to the credit
174 of the "Motor Vehicle Commission Fund", which is hereby
175 created. The motor vehicle commission fund shall be
176 administered by the Missouri department of revenue. The
177 provisions of section 33.080 to the contrary
SB 1016 7
178 notwithstanding, money in such fund shall not be transferred
179 and placed to the credit of the general revenue fund until
180 the amount in the motor vehicle commission fund at the end
181 of the biennium exceeds two times the amount of the
182 appropriation from such fund for the preceding fiscal year
183 or, if the department requires permit renewal less
184 frequently than yearly, then three times the appropriation
185 from such fund for the preceding fiscal year. The amount,
186 if any, in the fund which shall lapse is that amount in the
187 fund which exceeds the multiple of the appropriation from
188 such fund for the preceding fiscal year.

190 manufacturer, motor vehicle dealer, wholesale motor vehicle
191 dealer, boat dealer, powersport dealer, wholesale motor
