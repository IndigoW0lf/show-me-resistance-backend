37 and secondary education shall remit to school districts and
38 charter schools an amount equal to the product of the state
39 adequacy target and the dollar-value modifier, as such terms
40 are defined in section 163.011, and the average daily
41 attendance of pupils who are eligible for free and reduced
42 price lunch and who attend, in the year prior to their
43 kindergarten enrollment eligibility, an early childhood
44 education program:
45 (a) That is operated by and in a district or by a

61 payments of funds appropriated pursuant to the provisions of
62 section 163.044.
63 3. In establishing standards for any early childhood
64 education program that is under contract with a district or
65 charter school that has declared itself as a local
66 educational agency, the state board of education shall
67 consider:
68 (1) Whether a program offers full-day and full-year
69 programming;

71 consistent with reasonable standards set by early childhood
72 education program accrediting agencies;
73 (3) Whether a program offers professional development
74 supports for educators and the type of supports offered;
75 (4) Whether a program uses appropriately credentialed
76 educators;
77 (5) Whether a program uses an early childhood

80 the curriculum is developmentally appropriate; and
81 (6) Any other factor that the state board of education
82 determines to be significant in ensuring that children
83 achieve high levels of kindergarten readiness.
84 The state board of education shall require that staff
85 members of any early childhood education program that is

87 declared itself as a local educational agency undergo
