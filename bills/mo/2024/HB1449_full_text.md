393.170. 1. No gas corporation, electrical corporation, water corporation or sewer

3 system, other than an energy generation unit that has a capacity of one megawatt or less,
4 without first having obtained the permission and approval of the commission.

18 conferred by such certificate of convenience and necessity issued by the commission shall be
19 null and void.
20 4. (1) The provisions of this subsection shall apply when the permission and
21 approval sought from the commission under subsection 1 of this section is for the
22 construction of electric transmission facilities approved by a regional transmission
23 operator. To the greatest extent practical, such electric transmission facilities shall be
24 designed, consistent with electric industry standards, to utilize a multi-circuit
25 configuration, be sited with or along existing above-ground infrastructure, or replace
26 or upgrade existing above-ground infrastructure, whether or not the existing electric
27 transmission facility infrastructure utilized is owned by an electrical corporation that
28 owns in-service electric transmission facilities in this state that are under the functional
29 control of a regional transmission operator. Electric transmission facilities need not be
30 designed as provided in the immediately preceding sentence if the commission
31 determines in a proceeding pursuant to which permission and approval is sought
32 undersubsection1ofthissectionthatsuchadesignisinconsistentwithelectricindustry
33 standards, is inconsistent with the reliability basis given for the electric transmission
34 facilitiesproject,orisnotinthebestinterestoftheelectricalcorporation'scustomersor,
35 to the extent the electrical corporation does not directly serve retail customers, the
36 interests of the electric customers whose retail rates will reflect the majority of the costs
37 of the electric transmission facilities to-be-constructed. In addition, to the extent such
38 electric transmission facilities will be sited with or along or will replace or upgrade
39 existing above-ground electrical infrastructure that is not owned by an entity seeking
40 permission and approval pursuant to an application filed under subsection 1 of this
41 sectionorbyitsaffiliate,theentityorentitiesthatwillownthenewelectrictransmission
42 facilities subject to the application shall obtain from the underlying fee owners
43 independent real estate rights necessary to accommodate the installation and operation
44 thereof. Nothing inthis subdivisionshall relieve suchentity orentities oftheobligations
45 contained in sections 523.039 or 523.256, to the extent those obligations would otherwise
46 apply.
47 (2) In addition to the design requirements in subdivision (1) of this subsection,
48 each electrical corporation seeking permission and approval under subsection 1 of this
49 section shall competitively bid the major construction components of each project for
50 which permission and approval is sought and shall utilize competitive sourcing
51 strategies for all related major materials.
52 (3) Only electrical corporations that own in-service electric transmission
53 facilities in this state that are under the functional control of a regional transmission
HB 1449 3
54 operator and to which the electric transmission facilities subject to the application will
55 connect, either initially or once construction of all electric transmission facilities
56 approved by the regional transmission operator as of the time of the commission's
57 approval of the application is completed, may file applications with the commission for
58 permission and approval to construct electric transmission facilities described in this
59 subsection. Within ninety days following approval of the construction of electric
60 transmission facilities by the applicable regional transmission operator, an electric
61 corporation seeking permission and approval for electric transmission facilities under
62 theprovisionsofthissubsectionmay notifythecommissionthatitwillnotconstructany
63 or some portion of the facilities approved. If such notice is given and indicates the
64 notifying electrical corporation will not construct any of the facilities approved, the
65 commission may grant permission and approval for such facilities' construction to any
66 otherelectrical corporation. If such notice indicates that it will assign all or a portion of
67 the facilities approved to another electrical corporation, the commission may grant
68 permission and approval for the facilities that were assigned to the assignee electrical
69 corporation and such electrical corporation's construction of the facilities shall be
70 subject to this subsection.
71 (4) This subsection shall not limit the right of any electrical corporation to seek
72 permission and approval from the commission to construct, operate, and maintain
73 electric transmission facilities in this state that will not initially connect to electric
74 transmission facilitiesin this state thatarenot under the functional control of a regional
75 transmission operator. This subsection shall also not limit the right of any electrical
76 corporation, any municipal utility operating under chapter 91, any joint electric utility
77 commission operating under chapter 393, any rural electric cooperative organized or
78 operatingunderchapter 394,anycorporation organizedon anonprofit ora cooperative
79 basis as described in subsection 1 of section 394.200, or any electrical corporation
80 operatingunderthenot-for-profitcooperativebusinessplanasdescribedinsubsection2
81 of section 393.110 to construct, operate, and maintain electric transmission facilities in
82 this state that are not under the functional control of a regional transmission operator.
83 (5) In considering applications under this section, the commission shall take into
84 account the importance of construction of electric transmission facilities in the state
85 needed to support the state's economy, the benefits of electric transmission facility
86 construction to customers, and the importance of transmission facility construction in
87 ensuring reliable electric service in the state in the twenty-first century and beyond.
