To repeal sections 287.120 and 287.140, RSMo, and to enact in lieu thereof two new sections
relating to workers' compensation.
Be it enacted by the General Assembly of the state of Missouri, as follows:
Section A. Sections 287.120 and 287.140, RSMo, are repealed and two new sections
2 enacted in lieu thereof, to be known as sections 287.120 and 287.140, to read as follows:
287.120. 1. Every employer subject to the provisions of this chapter shall be liable,
2 irrespective of negligence, to furnish compensation under the provisions of this chapter for
3 personal injury or death of the employee by accident or occupational disease arising out of
4 and in the course of the employee's employment. Any employee of such employer shall not
5 beliableforany injuryordeathfor whichcompensationisrecoverableunderthis chapterand
6 every employer and employees of such employer shall be released from all other liability
7 whatsoever, whether to the employee or any other person, except that an employee shall not
8 be released from liability for injury or death if the employee engaged in an affirmative
9 negligent act that purposefully and dangerously caused or increased the risk of injury. The
10 term "accident" as used in this section shall include, but not be limited to, injury or death of
11 the employee caused by the unprovoked violence or assault against the employee by any
12 person.
13 2. The rights and remedies herein granted to an employee shall exclude all other
14 rights and remedies of the employee, the employee's spouse, parents, personal
15 representatives, dependents, heirs or next kin, at common law or otherwise, on account of
16 such injury or death by accident or occupational disease, except such rights and remedies as
17 are not provided for by this chapter.
EXPLANATION — Matter enclosed in bold-faced brackets [thus] in the above bill is not enacted and is
intended to be omitted from the law. Matter in bold-face type in the above bill is proposed language.
HB 2135 2
18 3. No compensation shall be allowed under this chapter for the injury or death due to
19 the employee's intentional self-inflicted injury, but the burden of proof of intentional self-
20 inflicted injury shall be on the employer or the person contesting the claim for allowance.
21 4. Where the injury is caused by the failure of the employer to comply with any
22 statute in this state or any lawful order of the division or the commission, the compensation
23 and death benefit provided for under this chapter shall be increased fifteen percent.
24 5. Where the injury is caused by the failure of the employee to use safety devices
25 where provided by the employer, or from the employee's failure to obey any reasonable rule
26 adopted by the employer for the safety of employees, the compensation and death benefit
27 provided for herein shall be reduced at least twenty-five but not more than fifty percent;
28 provided, that it is shown that the employee had actual knowledge of the rule so adopted by
29 the employer; and provided, further, that the employer had, prior to the injury, made a
30 reasonableefforttocausehisorheremployeestousethesafetydeviceordevicesandtoobey
31 or follow the rule so adopted for the safety of the employees.
32 6. (1) Where the employee fails to obey any rule or policy adopted by the employer
33 relating to a drug-free workplace or the use of alcohol, marijuana, or nonprescribed
34 controlled drugs in the workplace, the compensation and death benefit provided for herein
35 shall be reduced fifty percent if the injury was sustained in conjunction with the use of
36 alcohol, marijuana, or nonprescribed controlled drugs.
37 (2) If, however, the use of alcohol, marijuana, or nonprescribed controlled drugs in
38 violationoftheemployer'sruleorpolicyistheproximatecauseoftheinjury,thenthebenefits
39 orcompensationotherwisepayableunderthischapterfordeathordisabilityshallbeforfeited.
40 (3) The voluntary use of alcohol to the percentage of blood alcohol sufficient under
41 Missouri law to constitute legal intoxication shall give rise to a rebuttable presumption that
42 the voluntary use of alcohol under such circumstances was the proximate cause of the injury.
43 A preponderance of the evidence standard shall apply to rebut such presumption. An
44 employee's refusal to take a test for alcohol, marijuana, or a nonprescribed controlled
45 substance, as defined by section 195.010, at the request of the employer shall result in the
46 forfeiture of benefits under this chapter if the employer had sufficient cause to suspect use of
47 alcohol, marijuana, or a nonprescribed controlled substance by the claimant or if the
48 employer's policy clearly authorizes post-injury testing.
49 (4) Any positive test result for a nonprescribed controlled drug, marijuana, or the
50 metabolites of such drug from an employee shall give rise to a rebuttable presumption, which
51 may be rebutted by a preponderance of evidence, that the tested nonprescribed controlled
52 drugormarijuanawasintheemployee'ssystematthetimeoftheaccidentorinjuryandthat
53 the injury was sustained in conjunction with the use of the tested nonprescribed controlled
54 drug if:

56 injury;
57 (b) Notice was given to the employee of the test results within fourteen calendar days
58 of the insurer or group self-insurer receiving actual notice of the confirmatory test results;
59 (c) Theemployeewasgivenanopportunitytoperformasecondtestupontheoriginal
60 sample; and
61 (d) The initial or any subsequent testing that forms the basis of the presumption was
62 confirmed by mass spectrometry using generally accepted medical or forensic testing
63 procedures.
64 (5) The provisions of this subsection are subject to Article XIV, Section 1 of the
65 Constitution of the state of Missouri relating to medical use of marijuana and the
66 nondiscrimination provision of subdivision (15) of subsection 7 of Article XIV, Section 1
67 of the Constitution of the state of Missouri.
68 7. Where the employee's participation in a recreational activity or program is the
69 prevailing cause of the injury, benefits or compensation otherwise payable under this chapter
70 for death or disability shall be forfeited regardless that the employer may have promoted,
71 sponsored or supported the recreational activity or program, expressly or impliedly, in whole
72 or in part. The forfeiture of benefits or compensation shall not apply when:
73 (1) The employee was directly ordered by the employer to participate in such
74 recreational activity or program;
75 (2) The employee was paid wages or travel expenses while participating in such
76 recreational activity or program; or
77 (3) The injury from such recreational activity or program occurs on the employer's
78 premises due to an unsafe condition and the employer had actual knowledge of the
79 employee's participation in the recreational activity or program and of the unsafe condition of
80 the premises and failed to either curtail the recreational activity or program or cure the unsafe
81 condition.
82 8. Mental injury resulting from work-related stress does not arise out of and in the
83 course of the employment, unless it is demonstrated that the stress is work related and was
84 extraordinary and unusual. The amount of work stress shall be measured by objective
85 standards and actual events.
86 9. A mental injury is not considered to arise out of and in the course of the
87 employment if it resulted from any disciplinary action, work evaluation, job transfer, layoff,
88 demotion, termination or any similar action taken in good faith by the employer.
89 10. The ability of a firefighter to receive benefits for psychological stress under
90 section 287.067 shall not be diminished by the provisions of subsections 8 and 9 of this
91 section.
HB 2135 4
287.140. 1. In addition to all other compensation paid to the employee under this
2 section, the employee shall receive and the employer shall provide such medical, surgical,
3 chiropractic, and hospital treatment, including nursing, custodial, ambulance and medicines,
4 as may reasonably be required after the injury or disability, to cure and relieve from the
5 effects of the injury. If the employee desires, he shall have the right to select his own
6 physician, surgeon, or other such requirement at his own expense. Where the requirements
7 are furnished by a public hospital or other institution, payment therefor shall be made to the
8 properauthorities. Regardlessofwhetherthehealthcareproviderisselectedbytheemployer
9 or is selected by the employee at the employee's expense, the health care provider shall have
10 the affirmative duty to communicate fully with the employee regarding the nature of the
11 employee's injury and recommended treatment exclusive of any evaluation for a permanent
12 disability rating. Failure to perform such duty to communicate shall constitute a disciplinary
13 violation by the provider subject to the provisions of chapter 620. When an employee is
14 required to submit to medical examinations or necessary medical treatment at a place outside
15 of the local or metropolitan area from the employee's principal place of employment, the
16 employer or its insurer shall advance or reimburse the employee for all necessary and
17 reasonable expenses; except that an injured employee who resides outside the state of
18 Missouri and who is employed by an employer located in Missouri shall have the option of
19 selecting the location of services provided in this section either at a location within one
20 hundred miles of the injured employee's residence, place of injury or place of hire by the
21 employer. The choice of provider within the location selected shall continue to be made by
22 the employer. In case of a medical examination if a dispute arises as to what expenses shall
23 be paid by the employer, the matter shall be presented to the legal advisor, the administrative
24 law judge or the commission, who shall set the sum to be paid and same shall be paid by the
25 employer prior to the medical examination. In no event, however, shall the employer or its
26 insurer be required to pay transportation costs for a greater distance than two hundred fifty
27 miles each way from place of treatment.
28 2. If it be shown to the division or the commission that the requirements are being
29 furnished in such manner that there is reasonable ground for believing that the life, health, or
30 recovery of the employee is endangered thereby, the division or the commission may order a
31 change in the physician, surgeon, hospital or other requirement.

73 employee may be partially or wholly relieved of the effects of a permanent injury by the use
74 thereof. The director of the division shall establish a procedure whereby a claim for
