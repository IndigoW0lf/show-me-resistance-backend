1 140.010. 1. All real estate upon which the taxes
2 remain unpaid on the first day of January, annually, are
3 delinquent, and the county collector shall enforce the lien
4 of the state thereon, as required by this chapter. Any
5 failure to properly return the delinquent list, as required
6 by this chapter, in no way affects the validity of the
7 assessment and levy of taxes, nor of the foreclosure and
8 sale by which the collection of the taxes is enforced, nor
9 in any manner affects the lien of the state on the
10 delinquent real estate for the taxes unpaid thereon.
11 2. Alternatively, any county may, by adoption of a
12 resolution or order of the county commission of such county,
13 elect to operate under the provisions of sections 141.210 to
14 141.810 for any parcel for which there is an unpaid tax bill
15 for a period of at least two years after the date on which
16 it became delinquent. Any county electing to operate as
17 such shall be called a "partial opt-in county". No county
18 eligible to establish a land bank agency under subsection 1
19 of section 140.981 shall elect to operate as a partial opt-
20 in county unless the county first elects to establish a land
SB 1511 3
21 bank agency as provided in subsection 1 of section 140.981.
22 In accordance with section 141.290, after the adoption of
23 such resolution or order by a county commission, the
24 collector of the county shall decide which tax delinquent
25 parcels shall proceed according to the provisions of
26 sections 141.210 to 141.810. Such parcels shall be exempt
27 from the provisions of sections 140.030 to 140.722. The

8 county.
9 2. The person or land bank agency offering
10 at said sale, whether in person or by electronic
11 media, to pay the required sum for a tract shall
12 be considered the purchaser of such land;

14 designated agent who is currently delinquent on
15 any tax payments on any property, other than a
16 delinquency on the property being offered for
17 sale, and who does not sign an affidavit stating
18 such at the time of sale. Failure to sign such
19 affidavit as well as signing a false affidavit
20 may invalidate such sale. No bid shall be
21 received from any person not a resident of the
22 state of Missouri or a foreign corporation or
23 entity all deemed nonresidents. A nonresident

43 binding upon any person or corporation claiming
44 under the person consenting to jurisdiction and
45 making the appointment herein referred to;
46 provided further, that in the event of the
47 death, disability or refusal to act of the
48 person appointed as agent of said nonresident
49 the county clerk shall become the appointee as

33 an appointment of some citizen of said county as agent of
34 said nonresident, and consenting that service of process on

61 real property that has two or more violations of the
62 municipality's building or housing codes. A prospective
63 bidder may make such a demonstration by presenting

SB 1511 49
24 (1) The identity of the petitioner and the name and

50 [5.] 6. The petition when so filed shall have the same

53 foreclose the tax lien or liens against any one of said
54 parcels of real estate.
SB 1511 50
1 141.440. 1. The collector shall also cause to be
2 prepared and sent by restricted, registered or certified
3 mail with postage prepaid, within thirty days after the
4 filing of such petition, a [brief] notice of the [filing of
5 the suit] petition, to the persons named in the petition as
6 being the last known persons in whose names tax bills
7 affecting the respective parcels of real estate described in
8 said petition were last billed or charged on the books of
9 the collector, or the last known owner of record, if
10 different, and to the addresses of said persons upon said
11 records of the collector. The terms "restricted",
12 "registered" or "certified mail" as used in this section
13 mean mail which carries on the face thereof in a conspicuous
14 place, where it will not be obliterated, the endorsement
15 "DELIVER TO ADDRESSEE ONLY", and which also requires a
16 return receipt or a statement by the postal authorities that
17 the addressee refused to receive and receipt for such mail.
18 If the notice is returned to the collector by the postal
19 authorities as undeliverable for reasons other than the
20 refusal by the addressee to receive and receipt for the
21 notice as shown by the return receipt, then the collector
22 shall make a search of the records maintained by the county,
23 including those kept by the recorder of deeds, to discern
24 the name and address of any person who, from such records,
25 appears as a successor to the person to whom the original
26 notice was addressed, and to cause another notice to be
27 mailed to such person. The collector shall prepare and file
28 with the circuit clerk at least thirty days before judgment
29 is entered by the court on the petition an affidavit
30 reciting to the court any name, address and serial number of
31 the tract of real estate affected by any such notices of
32 suit that are undeliverable because of an addressee's
SB 1511 51
33 refusal to receive and receipt for the same, or of any
34 notice otherwise nondeliverable by mail, or in the event
35 that any name or address does not appear on the records of
36 the collector, then of that fact. The affidavit in addition
37 to the recitals set forth above shall also state reason for
38 the nondelivery of such notice.
39 2. The collector shall prepare and send, by first-
40 class mail, a copy of the petition within thirty days after
41 the filing of such a petition to the occupant of such parcel
42 or property.
1 141.500. 1. After the trial of the issues, the court
2 shall, as promptly as circumstances permit, render
3 judgment. If the court finds that no tax bill upon the land
4 collectible by the collector or the relator was delinquent
5 when the suit was instituted or tried, then the judgment of
6 the court shall be that the cause be dismissed as to the
7 parcels of real estate described in the tax bill; or, if the
8 evidence warrant, the judgment may be for the principal
9 amount of the delinquent tax bills upon the real estate upon
10 which suit was brought, together with interest, penalties,
11 attorney's and appraiser's fees and costs computed as of the
12 date of the judgment. The judgment may recite the amount of
13 each tax bill, the date when it began to bear interest, and
14 the rate of such interest, together with the rate and amount
15 of penalties, attorney's and appraiser's fees not to exceed
16 fifteen dollars. It may decree that the lien upon the
17 parcels of real estate described in the tax bill be
18 foreclosed and such real estate sold by the sheriff, and the
19 cause shall be continued for further proceedings, as herein
20 provided.
21 2. The collector [may, at his option,] shall cause to
22 be prepared and sent by restricted, registered or certified
SB 1511 52
23 mail with postage prepaid, within thirty days after the
24 rendering of such judgment, a brief notice of such judgment
25 and the availability of a written redemption contract
26 pursuant to section 141.530 to the persons named in the
27 judgment as being the last known persons in whose names tax
28 bills affecting the respective parcels of real estate
29 described in such judgment were last billed or charged on
30 the books of the collector, or the last known owner of
31 record, if different, and to the addresses of such persons
32 upon the records of the collector. The terms "restricted",
33 "registered" or "certified mail" as used in this section
34 mean mail which carries on the face thereof in a conspicuous
35 place, where it will not be obliterated, the endorsement,
36 "DELIVER TO ADDRESSEE ONLY", and which also requires a
37 return receipt or a statement by the postal authorities that
38 the addressee refused to receive and receipt for such mail.
39 If the notice is returned to the collector by the postal
40 authorities as undeliverable for reasons other than the
41 refusal by the addressee to receive and receipt for the
42 notice as shown by the return receipt, then the collector
43 shall make a search of the records maintained by the county,
44 including those kept by the recorder of deeds, to discern
45 the name and address of any person who, from such records,
46 appears as a successor to the person to whom the original
47 notice was addressed, and to cause another notice to be
48 mailed to such person. The collector shall prepare and file
49 with the circuit clerk prior to confirmation hearings an
50 affidavit reciting to the court any name, address and serial
51 number of the tract of real estate affected of any such
52 notices of judgment that are undeliverable because of an
53 addressee's refusal to receive and receipt for the same, or
54 of any notice otherwise nondeliverable by mail, or in the
SB 1511 53
55 event that any name or address does not appear on the
56 records of the collector, then of that fact. The affidavit
57 in addition to the recitals set forth above shall also state
58 reason for the nondelivery of such notice.
59 3. The collector shall prepare and send to the
60 occupant of such parcel or property, by first-class mail, a
61 copy of the judgment of foreclosure within thirty days after
62 the date of such judgment.
1 141.520. 1. After the judgment of foreclosure has
2 been entered, or, after a motion for a new trial has been
3 overruled, or, if an appeal be taken from such judgment and
4 the judgment has been affirmed, after the sheriff shall have
5 been notified by any party to the suit that such judgment
6 has been affirmed on appeal and that the mandate of the
7 appellate court is on file with the circuit clerk, there
8 shall be a waiting period of six months before any
9 advertisement of sheriff's sale shall be published.
10 2. If any such parcel of real estate be not redeemed,
11 or if no written contract providing for redemption be made
12 within six months after the date of the judgment of
13 foreclosure, if no motion for rehearing be filed, and, if
14 filed, within six months after such motion may have been
15 overruled, or, if an appeal be taken from such judgment and
16 the judgment be affirmed, within six months after the
17 sheriff shall have been notified by any party to the suit
18 that such judgment has been affirmed on appeal and that the
19 mandate of the appellate court is on file with the circuit
20 clerk, the sheriff shall commence to advertise the real
21 estate described in the judgment and shall fix the date of
22 sale within thirty days after the date of the first
23 publication of the notice of sheriff's sale as herein
SB 1511 54
24 provided, and shall at such sale proceed to sell the real
25 estate.
26 3. Any provisions of this chapter to the contrary
27 notwithstanding, the owner of any parcel of real property
28 against which a judgment has been rendered shall not have
29 the right to redeem such property from said judgment if at
30 the time of judgment such property is assessed as
31 residential property and the judgment finds the property has
32 been vacant for a period of not less than six months prior
33 to the judgment. After a judgment as provided for in this
34 section becomes final, the waiting period shall not apply to
35 such judgment and a sale under execution of the judgment
36 shall be immediately held as provided under the applicable
37 provisions of this chapter.
38 4. In partial opt-in counties, no later than one
39 hundred twenty days prior to the sheriff's sale, the
40 collector shall obtain from a licensed title company or
41 attorney a title search that includes all conveyances,
42 liens, and charges against the real estate involved in the
43 suit for any parcel of real estate against which the
44 collector has obtained a judgment under section 141.500 and
45 for which it has been decreed that the lien upon the parcel
46 of real estate described in the tax bill be foreclosed and
47 such real estate sold by the sheriff. The charge of such
48 title search may be recovered from the proceeds of the sale
49 under section 141.580.
50 5. After obtaining or conducting a title search, the
51 collector shall initiate a search of the following records
52 to identify and locate interested parties and addresses
53 reasonably calculated to apprise interested parties of the
54 suit:
SB 1511 55
55 (1) Land title records in the office of the county
56 recorder of deeds;
57 (2) Tax records in the office of the local treasurer;
58 (3) Tax records in the office of the local assessor;
59 (4) A search of court records in Missouri CaseNet; and
60 (5) For a business entity, records filed with the
61 secretary of state.
62 The collector may also incur reasonable costs for web-based
63 investigatory searches to supplement the search for
64 interested parties and addresses. The reasonable cost of
65 locating interested parties and addresses for notice may be
66 recovered from the proceeds of the sale under section
67 141.580.
68 6. No later than thirty days prior to the sheriff's
69 sale, the collector shall send notice of the sale to all
70 interested parties at the address most likely to apprise
71 interested parties of the sale. The notice shall provide
72 the date, time, and place of the sale and shall also state
73 that the parcel may be redeemed prior to the sale as
74 specified in sections 141.420 and 141.530. The notice
75 required by this subsection shall be mailed first class,
76 postage prepaid. The cost of notice under this subsection
77 may be recovered from the proceeds of the sale under section
78 141.580.
79 7. No later than twenty days prior to the sheriff's
80 sale, the sheriff shall enter upon the parcel subject to
81 foreclosure of these tax liens and post a written
82 informational notice in a conspicuous location, attached to
83 a structure, and intended to be visible by the nearest
84 public right-of-way. This notice shall describe the parcel
85 and advise that it is the subject of delinquent land tax
SB 1511 56
86 collection proceedings brought under sections 141.210 to
87 141.810 and sections 141.980 to 141.1015 and that it may be
88 sold for the payment of delinquent taxes at a sale to be
89 held at a certain time, date, and place and shall also
90 contain the tax identification number and the phone number
91 and address of the collector as well as a prohibition
92 against removal unless the parcel has been redeemed. The
93 notice shall be not less than eight inches by ten inches and
94 shall be laminated or otherwise sufficiently weatherproof to
95 withstand normal exposure to rain, snow, and other
96 conditions. The sheriff shall document, by time-stamped
97 photograph, compliance with this section, make such
98 documentation generally available upon request, and provide
99 verification by affidavit of compliance with this section.
100 The cost of notice under this subsection may be recovered
101 from the proceeds of the sale under section 141.580.
102 8. In addition to the other notice requirements of
103 this section, no later than twenty days prior to the
104 sheriff's sale, the sheriff shall attempt in-person notice
105 that shall describe the parcel and advise that it is the

108 141.980 to 141.1015; that shall state that it may be sold

116 person to whom notice was attempted. The sheriff shall
117 document compliance with this section, make such

1 141.535. 1. [In any county with a charter form of
2 government and with more than six hundred thousand but fewer
3 than seven hundred thousand inhabitants] If a parcel is the
4 subject of an action filed under sections 447.620 to
5 447.640, the court shall stay the sale of any tax parcel to
6 be sold under execution of a tax foreclosure judgment
7 obtained under this chapter, [which is the subject of an
8 action filed under sections 447.620 to 447.640,] provided
9 that the party which has brought such an action has paid
10 into the circuit court the principal amount of all land
11 taxes then due and owing under the tax foreclosure judgment,
12 exclusive of penalties, interest, attorney fees, and court
13 costs, prior to the date of any proposed sale under
14 execution. The party bringing such action shall provide
15 written notice of the filing of the action to the court
16 administrator and file with the circuit court in which the
17 action is pending a certificate that such notice has been
18 provided to the court administrator. If the party that

20 dismisses its action prior to gaining temporary possession
21 of the property, it shall recover any amounts paid into the
22 circuit court under this subsection.
23 2. [Upon the granting by the court of temporary
24 possession of any property under section 447.632 and again
25 upon the approval by the court of a sheriff's deed under
26 section 447.625, the circuit court shall direct payment to
27 the county collector of all principal land taxes theretofore
28 paid into the circuit court. In addition,] In any order
SB 1511 58
29 granting a sheriff's deed under section 447.625 or a
30 judicial deed under section 447.640, the court shall also
31 order the permanent extinguishment of liability against the
32 grantee [of the sheriff's deed,] and [all] the grantee's
33 successors in interest[; excepting however, any defendant in
34 such action,] for penalties, interest, attorney fees, and
35 court costs arising from actions to collect delinquent land
36 taxes due on the subject property. The funds paid into the
37 court for land taxes under subsection 1 of this section
38 shall then be paid to the county collector.
39 3. If an owner of such a property moves the court for
40 restoration of possession of the subject property under
41 section 447.638, the owner shall pay into the circuit court
42 all land tax amounts currently due and owing on the
43 property, including all statutory penalties, interest,
44 attorney fees, and court costs retroactive to the date of
45 accrual, and in the event that an owner of the tax parcel
46 regains possession under section 447.638, funds deposited by
47 the owner under this subsection shall be paid to the county
48 collector, and funds paid into the court by a party under
49 subsection 1 of this section shall be paid out in full to
50 the payer.
51 [3. If the party which brought the action under
52 sections 447.620 to 447.640 dismisses its action prior to
53 gaining temporary possession of the property, it shall
54 recover any amounts paid into the circuit court prior to
55 that date for principal land taxes.
56 4. In the event that an owner of the tax parcel
57 regains possession under section 447.638, the party which
58 brought the action under sections 447.620 to 447.640 shall
59 recover from that owner an amount equal to that paid into
SB 1511 59
60 the court by said party and paid to the county collector
61 under this section, and shall be granted judgment thereon.]
1 141.540. 1. In any county at a certain front door of
2 whose courthouse sales of real estate are customarily made
3 by the sheriff under execution, the sheriff shall advertise
4 for sale and sell the respective parcels of real estate
5 ordered sold by [him or her] the sheriff pursuant to any
6 judgment of foreclosure by any court pursuant to sections

8 courthouses, but the sale of such parcels of real estate

69 3. Such advertisement shall be published four times,
70 once a week, upon the same day of each week during
71 successive weeks prior to the date of such sale, in a daily
72 newspaper of general circulation regularly published in the
73 county, qualified according to law for the publication of
74 public notices and advertisements.
75 [4. In addition to the provisions herein for notice
76 and advertisement of sale, the county collector shall enter
77 upon the property subject to foreclosure of these tax liens
78 and post a written informational notice in any conspicuous
79 location thereon. This notice shall describe the property
80 and advise that it is the subject of delinquent land tax
81 collection proceedings before the circuit court brought
82 pursuant to sections 141.210 to 141.810 and 141.980 to
83 141.1015 and that it may be sold for the payment of
84 delinquent taxes at a sale to be held at ten o'clock a.m.,
85 date and place, and shall also contain a file number and the
86 address and phone number of the collector. If the collector
87 chooses to post such notices as authorized by this
88 subsection, such posting must be made not later than the
89 fourteenth day prior to the date of the sale.
90 5. The collector shall, concurrently with the
91 beginning of the publication of sale, cause to be prepared
92 and sent by restricted, registered or certified mail with
93 postage prepaid, a brief notice of the date, location, and
94 time of sale of property in foreclosure of tax liens
95 pursuant to sections 141.210 to 141.810 and 141.980 to
96 141.1015, to the persons named in the petition as being the
97 last known persons in whose names tax bills affecting the
98 respective parcels of real estate described in said petition
99 were last billed or charged on the books of the collector,
100 or the last known owner of record, if different, and to the
SB 1511 62
101 addresses of said persons upon said records of the
102 collector. The terms "restricted", "registered" or
103 "certified mail" as used in this section mean mail which
104 carries on the face thereof in a conspicuous place, where it
105 will not be obliterated, the endorsement, "DELIVER TO
106 ADDRESSEE ONLY", and which also requires a return receipt or
107 a statement by the postal authorities that the addressee
108 refused to receive and receipt for such mail. If the notice
109 is returned to the collector by the postal authorities as
110 undeliverable for reasons other than the refusal by the
111 addressee to receive and receipt for the notice as shown by
112 the return receipt, then the collector shall make a search
113 of the records maintained by the county, including those
114 kept by the recorder of deeds, to discern the name and
115 address of any person who, from such records, appears as a
116 successor to the person to whom the original notice was
117 addressed, and to cause another notice to be mailed to such
118 person. The collector shall prepare and file with the
119 circuit clerk prior to confirmation hearings an affidavit
120 reciting to the court any name, address and serial number of
121 the tract of real estate affected of any such notices of
122 sale that are undeliverable because of an addressee's
123 refusal to receive and receipt for the same, or of any
124 notice otherwise nondeliverable by mail, or in the event
125 that any name or address does not appear on the records of
126 the collector, then of that fact. The affidavit in addition
127 to the recitals set forth above shall also state reason for
128 the nondelivery of such notice.
129 6. The collector may, at his or her option,
130 concurrently with the beginning of the publication of sale,
131 cause to be prepared and sent by restricted, registered or
132 certified mail with postage prepaid, a brief notice of the
SB 1511 63
133 date, location, and time of sale of property in foreclosure
134 of tax liens pursuant to sections 141.210 to 141.810, to the
135 mortgagee or security holder, if known, of the respective
136 parcels of real estate described in said petition, and to
137 the addressee of such mortgagee or security holder according
138 to the records of the collector. The terms "restricted",
139 "registered" or "certified mail" as used in this section
140 mean mail which carries on the face thereof in a conspicuous
141 place, where it will not be obliterated, the endorsement,
142 "DELIVER TO ADDRESSEE ONLY", and which also requires a
143 return receipt or a statement by the postal authorities that
144 the addressee refused to receive and receipt for such mail.
145 If the notice is returned to the collector by the postal
146 authorities as undeliverable for reasons other than the
147 refusal by the addressee to receive and receipt for the
148 notice as shown by the return receipt, then the collector
149 shall make a search of the records maintained by the county,
150 including those kept by the recorder of deeds, to discern
151 the name and address of any security holder who, from such
152 records, appears as a successor to the security holder to
153 whom the original notice was addressed, and to cause another
154 notice to be mailed to such security holder. The collector
155 shall prepare and file with the circuit clerk prior to
156 confirmation hearings an affidavit reciting to the court any
157 name, address and serial number of the tract of real estate
158 affected by any such notices of sale that are undeliverable
159 because of an addressee's refusal to receive and receipt for
160 the same, or of any notice otherwise nondeliverable by mail,
161 and stating the reason for the nondelivery of such notice.]
1 141.550. 1. The sale shall be conducted, the
2 sheriff's return thereof made, and the sheriff's deed
3 pursuant to the sale executed, all as provided in the case
SB 1511 64

13 nine hundred thousand]:
14 (1) The sale shall be held on the day for which it is
15 advertised, between the hours of nine o'clock a.m. and five

23 (2) The sale shall be conducted publicly, by auction,
24 for ready money. The parcel shall be sold to the highest

26 highest bid is [less than] equal to or greater than the full
27 amount of all tax bills [included in] due and owing on the
28 parcel, which may differ from the judgment[,] amount; plus
29 interest[,]; penalties[,]; attorney's fees and costs; and a
30 nonreimbursable, two-hundred-dollar bidder fee. Such bidder
31 fee shall be paid to the land trust or land bank agency for
32 the municipality or county in which the parcel is situated.
33 The bid amount shall not include any amounts for debts owed
34 to any sewer district then due thereon[.];
SB 1511 65
35 (3) No person shall be eligible to bid at the time of
36 the sale unless such person has, no later than ten days
37 before the sale date, demonstrated to the satisfaction of
38 the official charged by law with conducting the sale that he

40 county which is affected by a tax bill which has been
41 delinquent for more than six months [and is not the owner of
42 any parcel of real property with two or more violations of
43 the municipality's building or housing codes]. A
44 prospective bidder may make such a demonstration by
45 presenting statements from the appropriate collection [and
46 code enforcement] officials of the [municipality] county.
47 [Notwithstanding this provision, any taxing authority or
48 land bank agency shall be eligible to bid at any sale
49 conducted under this section without making such a
50 demonstration.] The official charged with conducting the
51 sale may require prospective bidders to submit an affidavit
52 attesting to the requirements of this subdivision and is
53 expressly authorized to permanently preclude any prospective
54 bidder from participating in the sale for failure to comply
55 with the provisions of this subdivision; and
56 (4) No foreign or domestic corporation or limited
57 liability company that has failed to appoint or maintain a
58 registered agent under chapter 347 or 351 shall be eligible
59 to bid at the time of the sale. No foreign corporate entity
60 shall be eligible to bid at the time of the sale unless it
61 has a certificate of authority to transact business in
62 Missouri under section 351.572. The official charged with
63 conducting the sale may require prospective bidders to
64 submit an affidavit attesting to the requirements of this
65 subdivision and is expressly authorized to permanently
66 preclude any prospective bidder from participating in the
SB 1511 66
67 sale for failure to comply with the provisions of this
68 subdivision.
69 3. The following provisions shall apply to any sale
70 under this section of property located within any
71 municipality contained wholly or partially within a county
72 with a population of over six hundred thousand inhabitants
73 and fewer than nine hundred thousand inhabitants:
74 (1) No person shall be eligible to bid at the time of
75 the sale unless such person has, no later than ten days
76 before the sale date, demonstrated to the satisfaction of
77 the official charged by law with conducting the sale that
78 the person is not the owner of any parcel of real property
79 with two or more violations of the municipality's building
80 or housing codes. A prospective bidder may make such a
81 demonstration by presenting statements from the appropriate
82 code enforcement officials of the municipality; and
83 (2) Notwithstanding the provisions of subdivision (1)
84 of this subsection, any taxing authority or land bank agency
85 shall be eligible to bid at the sale without making the
86 demonstration described in subdivision (1) of this
87 subsection.
88 4. Such sale shall convey the whole interest of every
89 person having or claiming any right, title or interest in or
90 lien upon such real estate, whether such person has answered
91 or not, subject to rights-of-way thereon of public utilities
92 upon which tax has been otherwise paid, and subject to the
93 lien thereon, if any, of the United States of America.
94 [4.] 5. The collector shall advance the sums necessary
95 to pay for the publication of all advertisements required by
96 sections 141.210 to 141.810 and sections 141.980 to 141.1015
97 and shall be allowed credit therefor in [his or her] the
98 collector's accounts with the county. The collector shall
SB 1511 67
99 give credit in such accounts for all such advances recovered
100 by [him or her] the collector. Such expenses of publication
101 shall be apportioned pro rata among and taxed as costs
102 against the respective parcels of real estate described in
103 the judgment; provided, however, that none of the costs
104 herein enumerated, including the costs of publication, shall
105 constitute any lien upon the real estate after such sale.
1 141.560. 1. If, when the sheriff offers the
2 respective parcels of real estate for sale, there be no
3 bidders for any parcel, or there be insufficient time or
4 opportunity to sell all of the parcels of real estate so
5 advertised, the sheriff shall adjourn such sale from day to
6 day at the same place and commencing at the same hour as
7 when first offered and shall announce that such real estate
8 will be offered or reoffered for sale at such time and place.
9 2. With respect to any parcel of real estate not
10 located wholly within a county or municipality that [is an
11 appointing authority] has established a land bank agency
12 under section [141.981] 140.981 or 141.980, in the event no
13 bid equal to the full amount of all tax bills [included in]
14 due and owing on the parcel, which may differ from the
15 judgment[,] amount; plus interest[,]; penalties[,];
16 attorney's fees and costs [then due thereon]; and a
17 nonreimbursable, two-hundred-dollar bidder fee that shall be
18 received at such sale after any parcel of real estate has
19 been offered for sale on three different days, which need
20 not be successive, the land [trustees] trust shall be deemed
21 to have bid the full amount of all tax bills included in the
22 judgment, interest, penalties, attorney's fees and costs
23 then due, and if no other bid be then received by the
24 sheriff in excess of the bid of the [trustees] land trust,
25 and the sheriff shall so announce at the sale, then the bid
SB 1511 68
26 of the [trustees] land trust shall be announced as
27 accepted. The sheriff shall report any such bid or bids so
28 made by the land [trustees] trust in the same way as [his]
29 the sheriff's report of other bids is made. [The land trust
30 shall pay any penalties, attorney's fees or costs included
31 in the judgment of foreclosure of such parcel of real
32 estate, when such parcel is sold or otherwise disposed of by
33 the land trust.] Upon confirmation by the court of such bid
34 at such sale by such land [trustees] trust, the collector
35 shall mark the tax bills so bid by the land [trustees] trust
36 as "cancelled by sale to the land trust" and shall take
37 credit for the full amount of such tax bills, including
38 principal amount, interest, penalties, attorney's fees, and
39 costs, on [his] the collector's books and in [his] the
40 collector's statements with any other taxing authorities.
41 3. With respect to any parcel of real estate located
42 wholly within a county or municipality that [is an
43 appointing authority under section 141.981] has established
44 a land bank agency under section 140.981 or 141.980, in the
45 event no bid equal to the full amount of all tax bills
46 [included in] due and owing on the parcel, which may differ
47 from the judgment[,] amount; plus interest[,]; penalties[,];
48 attorney's fees and costs [then due thereon]; and a
49 nonreimbursable, two-hundred-dollar bidder fee that shall be
50 received at such sale after such parcel of real estate has
51 been offered for sale on three different days, which need
52 not be successive, the land bank agency [for which said
53 municipality is an appointing authority] established under
54 section 140.981 or 141.980 shall be deemed to have bid the
55 full amount of all tax bills included in the judgment,
56 interest, penalties, attorney's fees and costs then due, and
57 the sheriff shall so announce at the sale, then the bid of
SB 1511 69
58 the land bank agency shall be announced as accepted. The
59 sheriff shall report any such bid or bids so made by such
60 land bank agency in the same way as [his] the sheriff's
61 report of other bids is made. Upon confirmation by the
62 court of such bid at such sale by such land bank agency, the
63 collector shall mark the tax bills so bid by such land bank
64 agency as "cancelled by sale to the land bank" and shall
65 take credit for the full amount of such tax bills, including
66 principal amount, interest, penalties, attorney's fees, and
67 costs, on [his] the collector's books and in [his] the
68 collector's statements with any other taxing authorities.
1 141.570. [1. The title to any real estate which shall
2 vest in the land trust under the provisions of sections
3 141.210 to 141.810 and sections 141.980 to 141.1015 shall be
4 held by the land trust of such county in trust for the tax
5 bill owners and taxing authorities having an interest in any
6 tax liens which were foreclosed, as their interests may
7 appear in the judgment of foreclosure. The title to any
8 real estate acquired by a land bank agency pursuant to a
9 deemed sale under subsection 3 of section 141.560, by deed
10 from a land trust under subsection 1 of section 141.984, or
11 pursuant to a sale under subdivision (2) of subsection 2 of
12 section 141.550 shall be held in trust for the tax bill
13 owners and taxing authorities having an interest in any tax
14 liens which were foreclosed, as their interests may appear
15 in the judgment of foreclosure.
16 2.] The title to any real estate which shall vest in
17 any purchaser, upon confirmation of such sale by the court,
18 or in any land bank agency or land trust, shall be an
19 absolute estate in fee simple, subject to rights-of-way
20 thereon of public utilities on which tax has been otherwise
21 paid, and subject to any lien thereon of the United States
SB 1511 70
22 of America, if any, and all persons and interested parties,
23 including the state of Missouri, any taxing authority or tax
24 district, as defined herein, judgment creditors,
25 lienholders, infants, incapacitated and disabled persons as
26 defined in chapter 475, and nonresidents who may have had
27 any right, title, interest, claim, or equity of redemption
28 in or to, or lien upon, such lands, shall be barred and
29 forever foreclosed of all such right, title, interest,
30 claim, lien or equity of redemption, and the court shall
31 order immediate possession of such real estate be given to
32 such purchaser; provided, however, that such title shall
33 also be subject to the liens of any tax bills [which may
34 have attached to such parcel of real estate prior to the
35 time of the filing of the petition affecting such parcel of
36 real estate not then delinquent, or] which may have attached
37 after the [filing of the petition and prior to] sheriff's
38 sale [and not included in any answer to such petition], but
39 if such parcel of real estate is deemed sold to the land
40 trust pursuant to subsection 2 of section 141.560, or deemed
41 sold to a land bank agency pursuant to subsection 3 of
42 section 141.560, or sold to a land bank agency pursuant to
43 subdivision (2) of subsection 2 of section 141.550, the
44 title thereto shall be free of any such liens to the extent
45 of the interest of any taxing authority in such real estate;
46 provided further, that [such title shall not be subject to
47 the lien of special tax bills which have attached to the
48 parcel of real estate prior to November 22, 1943, but] the
49 lien of [such] special tax bills shall attach to the
50 proceeds of the sheriff's sale, if any, or [to the proceeds
51 of the ultimate sale of such parcel by the land trust or
52 land bank agency] shall otherwise be forever barred and
53 foreclosed.
SB 1511 71
1 141.580. 1. Within six months after the sheriff sells
2 any parcel of real estate, the court shall, upon its own
3 motion or upon motion of any interested party, set the cause
4 down for hearing to confirm or set aside the foreclosure
5 sale thereof, even though such parcels are not all of the
6 parcels of real estate described in the notice of sheriff's
7 foreclosure sale. Notice of the hearing, or of the court
8 moving to confirm the foreclosure sale, shall be sent by any
9 interested party to each person who was sent notice of the
10 sale and to any interested parties as required by prevailing
11 notions of due process. At the time of such hearing, the
12 sheriff shall make report of the sale, and the court shall
13 hear evidence of the value of the property offered on behalf
14 of any interested party to the suit, and shall forthwith
15 determine whether an adequate consideration has been paid
16 for each such parcel. The court's judgment shall include a
17 specific finding that adequate notice was provided to all
18 interested parties under prevailing notions of due process
19 and sections 141.210 to 141.810 and sections 141.980 to
20 141.1015, reciting the notice efforts of the collector,
21 sheriff, and tax sale purchaser. Nothing in this section
22 shall be interpreted to preclude a successful tax sale
23 purchaser from asserting a claim to quiet title to the bid-
24 upon parcel under section 527.150.
25 2. For this purpose the court shall have power to
26 summon any city or county official or any private person to
27 testify as to the reasonable value of the property, and if
28 the court finds that adequate consideration has been paid,
29 the court shall confirm the sale and order the sheriff to
30 issue a deed to the purchaser. If the court finds that the
31 consideration paid is inadequate, the court shall confirm
32 the sale if the purchaser increases [his] the purchaser's
SB 1511 72
33 bid to such amount as the court deems to be adequate and
34 makes such additional payment, or if all tax bills included
35 in the judgment, interest, penalties, attorney's fees and
36 costs then due thereon are not paid in full by one or more
37 interested parties to the suit. If the court finds that the
38 consideration is inadequate, but the purchaser declines to
39 increase [his] the purchaser's bid to such amount as the
40 court deems adequate and make such additional payment, then
41 the sale shall be disapproved if all tax bills included in
42 the judgment, interest, penalties, attorney's fees and costs
43 then due thereon are paid in full by one or more interested
44 parties to the suit, the lien of the judgment continued, and
45 such parcel of real estate shall be again advertised and
46 offered for sale by the sheriff to the highest bidder at
47 public auction for cash at any subsequent sheriff's
48 foreclosure sale. Unless the court requires evidence of the
49 value of the property conveyed to land trust or a land bank
50 agency, none shall be required, and the amount bid by the
51 land [trustees] trust or such land bank agency shall be
52 deemed adequate consideration.
53 3. [Except as otherwise provided in subsection 6 of
54 section 141.984,] If the sale is confirmed, the court shall
55 order the proceeds of the sale applied in the following
56 order:
57 (1) To the payment of the costs of the publication of
58 the notice of foreclosure and of the sheriff's foreclosure
59 sale;
60 (2) To the payment of all of the collector's and
61 sheriff's costs including appraiser's fee and attorney's
62 fees;
63 (3) To the payment of all tax bills adjudged to be due
64 in the order of their priority, including principal,
SB 1511 73
65 interest and penalties thereon, except in the event of a
66 sale to any land bank agency, for which this subdivision
67 shall not apply.
68 If, after such payment, there is any sum remaining of the
69 proceeds of the sheriff's foreclosure sale, the court shall
70 thereupon try and determine the other issues in the suit in
71 accordance with section 141.480. If any answering parties
72 have specially appealed as provided in section 141.570, the
73 court shall retain the custody of such funds pending
74 disposition of such appeal, and upon disposition of such
75 appeal shall make such distribution. If there are not
76 sufficient proceeds of the sale to pay all claims in any
77 class described, the court shall order the same to be paid
78 pro rata in accordance with the priorities.
79 4. If there are any funds remaining of the proceeds
80 after the sheriff's sale and after the distribution of such
81 funds as herein set out and no person entitled to any such
82 funds, whether or not a party to the suit, shall, within two
83 years after such sale, appear and claim the funds, [they]
84 the funds shall be distributed to the appropriate taxing
85 authorities, except in partial opt-in counties, where the
86 funds shall be distributed to the school fund for the county.
87 5. Any county operating under the provisions of
88 sections 141.210 to 141.810 and sections 141.980 to 141.1015
89 may elect to allocate a portion of its share of the proceeds
90 toward a fund for the purpose of defending against claims
91 challenging the sufficiency of notice provisions under this
92 section.
93 6. Any interested party, other than the sheriff's sale
94 purchaser, who moves the court to set aside a sheriff's sale
95 after the issuance of a sheriff's deed made under the
SB 1511 74
96 provisions of sections 141.210 to 141.810 and sections
97 141.980 to 141.1015 shall be required to pay into the court
98 the redemption amount otherwise necessary under sections
99 141.420 and 141.530 prior to the court hearing any such
100 motion to set aside.
1 141.610. Each court administrator's or sheriff's deed
2 given pursuant to the provisions of the land tax collection
3 law shall be [presumptive] prima facie evidence that the
4 suit and all proceedings therein and all proceedings prior
5 thereto from and including assessment of the lands affected
6 thereby and all notices required by law were regular and in
7 accordance with all provisions of the law relating thereto.
8 The court administrator or sheriff shall record its deed and
9 shall collect said recording fee at the time of sale.
10 [After one year from the date of the court administrator's
11 foreclosure sale, the presumption shall be conclusive
12 pursuant to sections 141.210 to 141.810. Notwithstanding
13 section 516.010, no suit to set aside or to attack the
14 validity of any such court administrator's or sheriff's deed
15 shall be commenced or maintained unless the suit is filed
16 within one year from the date of the court administrator's
17 foreclosure sale.]
1 141.620. 1. In addition to all amounts due on any tax
2 bill, including principal, interest, penalties, attorney's
3 fees and costs, as now fixed by law, there shall be imposed
4 and charged as a part of the costs on each such tax bill a
5 suit penalty of five percent of the principal amount of the
6 tax bill to be due to the collector upon the filing of the
7 petition with the circuit clerk.
8 2. The collector shall set up a separate fund in [his]
9 the collector's accounts to which [he] the collector shall
10 credit such five percent suit penalties when paid, together
SB 1511 75
11 with all other penalties and costs recovered under this
12 action, and shall retain such portion thereof as may be
13 needed for the purpose of paying the expenses and costs

6 141.700 was operating on January 1, 2012,] electing to
7 operate wholly under the provisions of sections 141.210 to
8 141.810 may establish a land bank agency for the management,

13 generating, nontax-producing status to use in private
14 ownership or for public use. Such land bank agency shall be
15 established by ordinance or resolution as applicable. Such

17 that is located wholly or partially outside such
18 establishing municipality. [Such land bank agency shall not

SB 1511 79
33 priorities determined by the court on the basis that the
34 principal amount of [their] the beneficiaries' respective
35 tax bills bore to the total principal amount of all of the
36 tax bills described in the judgment.
37 3. Each land bank agency created pursuant to this
38 chapter shall be a public body corporate and politic, and

9 from all taxation by the state and by any of its political
10 subdivisions. Upon acquiring title to any real estate, a
11 land bank agency shall immediately notify the county
12 assessor and the collector of such ownership, and such real
13 estate shall be exempt from all taxation during the land
14 bank agency's ownership thereof, in the same manner and to
15 the same extent as any other publicly owned real estate, and
16 upon the sale or other disposition of any real estate held
17 by it, such land bank agency shall immediately notify the
18 county assessor and the collector of such change of
19 ownership; provided however, that such tax exemption for
20 improved and occupied real property held by such land bank
21 agency as lessor pursuant to a ground lease shall terminate
22 upon the first such occupancy, and such land bank agency
SB 1511 80
23 shall immediately notify the county assessor and the
24 collector of such occupancy.
25 3. Subject to the limitation set forth in subsection 1
26 of section 141.980, a land bank agency may acquire real
27 property or interests in property by gift, devise, transfer,

29 terms and conditions and in a manner the land bank agency
30 considers proper] pursuant to sections 141.560 to 141.580 or
31 section 141.821. A land bank agency may only purchase real
32 property for the purpose of adding to a parcel already owned
33 by the land bank agency.
34 4. Subject to the limitation set forth in subsection 1
35 of section 141.980, a land bank agency may acquire property
36 by purchase contracts, [lease purchase agreements,]
37 installment sales contracts, and land contacts, and may
38 accept transfers from political subdivisions upon such terms
39 and conditions as agreed to by the land bank agency and the
40 political subdivision. Subject to the limitation set forth
41 in subsection 1 of section 141.980, a land bank agency may
42 bid on any parcel of real estate offered for sale at a
43 sheriff's foreclosure sale held in accordance with section
44 141.550 [provided that if the bid is not a deemed bid under
45 subsection 3 of section 141.560, such parcel must be located
46 within a low- to moderate-income area designated as a target
47 area for revitalization by the municipality that created the
48 land bank agency]. Notwithstanding any other law to the
49 contrary, but subject to the limitation set forth in
50 subsection 1 of section 141.980, any political subdivision

60 land bank agency under subdivision (2) of subsection 2 of

62 of the land bank agency's bid that exceeds the amount of all
63 tax bills included in the judgment, interest, penalties,
64 attorney's fees and costs then due thereon. Such excess
65 shall be applied and distributed in accordance with
66 subsections 3 and 4 of section 141.580, exclusive of
67 subdivision (3) of subsection 3 thereof. Upon such
68 confirmation by the court, the collector shall mark the tax
69 bills included in the judgment as "cancelled by sale to the
70 land bank" and shall take credit for the full amount of such
71 tax bills, including principal amount, interest, penalties,
72 attorney's fees, and costs, on [his] the collector's books
73 and in [his] the collector's statements with any other
74 taxing authorities.

2 to file an action to quiet title pursuant to section 527.150
3 as to any real property in which the land bank agency has an
4 interest. For purposes of any and all such actions the land

7 to qualify the land bank agency as adequate petitioner in
8 such action.
9 2. Prior to the filing of an action to quiet title the
10 land bank agency shall conduct an examination of title to

13 to disconnect the customer's sewer line from the district's
14 line or request any private water company, public water
15 supply district, or any municipality supplying water to the

6 if at the time of judgment such property is
7 assessed as residential property and the
8 judgment finds the property has been vacant for
9 a period of not less than six months prior to
10 the judgment. After a judgment as provided for
11 in this section becomes final, a sale under
12 execution of the judgment shall be immediately
13 held as provided under the applicable provisions
14 of this chapter.]
1 [141.940. 1. Whenever a sale under

4 to the approval of the court, and the sheriff
5 shall report the sale and the amount of the bid
6 to the court in which judgment was rendered, and

12 the execution sale shall exceed fifty percent of
13 the value of the property, the court shall
14 confirm the sale, and the sheriff shall execute
15 a deed for the property.
16 3. If the amount bid by the purchaser is
17 less than fifty percent of the appraised value
18 of the property, and the title which would be
19 acquired by the purchaser is subject to other
20 taxes, which are a lien superior to the lien of
21 the taxes for which the judgment was rendered,
22 and the combined amount of such prior liens and
23 the amount bid by the purchaser shall exceed
24 fifty percent of the appraised value of the
25 property, the court shall likewise confirm the
26 sale, and the sheriff shall execute a deed to
27 the purchaser.
28 4. If the amount bid, together with prior
29 tax liens, if any, shall be less than fifty
30 percent of the appraised value of the property,
31 the court may require the purchaser to increase
32 his bid to an amount equal to fifty percent of
33 such appraised value, and if the purchaser
34 agrees so to do, and makes such additional
