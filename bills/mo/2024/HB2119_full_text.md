38 2. Foster youth with elevated needs-level B permanent who are involved in an
39 adoptive or legal guardianship placement shall receive subsidy payments that are equal
40 to the maintenance payments received for youth with elevated needs-level B through an
41 adoption subsidy agreement. Such youth shall be eligible for such payments when
42 adopted and without needing to seek a status change to youth with elevated needs-level
43 A or medical level. Such payments may continue for an adult adoptee with elevated
44 needs so long as the requirements under subsection 3 or 4 of this section are met. The
45 maintenance payments under this section shall be retroactively applied to the original
46 date of the home placement of the youth.
47 3. (1) The children's division may approve an 18+ adoption subsidy if the child
48 has extraordinary documented physical, dental, or mental health needs that require
49 care beyond eighteen years of age. When the child attains eighteen years of age, the
50 adoption subsidy shall be negotiated with the adoptive parent or parents according to
51 the child's current needs and with the intent of transitioning the child from subsidy
52 services to adult community services to ensure all necessary services are in place for the
53 child's success when the subsidy is no longer available.
HB 2119 3
54 (2) Six months prior to a youth's eighteenth birthday, if the youth is covered by
55 an adoption subsidy agreement, the adoptive parent or parents may make a request in
56 writing to the children's division for the division to assess whether the child is eligible
57 for an 18+ adoption subsidy agreement. The division shall make a determination as to
58 whether the youth has an extraordinary documented physical, dental, or mental health
59 need that requires care through a subsidy agreement beyond eighteen years of age.
60 Documentation of need from the youth's physician, psychiatrist, psychologist, or dentist
61 shall be obtained and submitted as supporting documentation of need.
62 (3) The adoptive parent or parents shall be made aware of the need to transition
63 the youth from an adoption subsidy to adult community services to meet the youth's
64 needs and provided referral information and assistance with obtaining the services as
65 needed. The adoptive parent or parents shall be advised that they are required to apply
66 for and participate in all such programs and services as may be reasonably necessary to
67 meet the needs of the youth as indicated in the agreement.
68 4. (1) The children's division shall approve an adoption subsidy for a
69 permanently disabled adopted person who is twenty-one years of age or older if the
70 adoptive parent or parents have been appointed guardianship of the person by a court
71 in this state. The adoption subsidy is not required to be renewed, provided that the
72 court and at least one physician asserts the permanence of the person's disability.
73 (2) Six months prior to the person attaining twenty-one years of age, the
74 adoptive parent or parents may make a request in writing to the children's division for
75 the division to assess whether the person is eligible for an extended adoption subsidy.
76 The division shall make a determination as to whether the person has an extraordinary
77 documentedphysical,dental,ormentalhealthneedthatrequirescarethroughasubsidy
78 agreement for a person twenty-one years of age or older. Documentation of need from
79 the person's physician, psychiatrist, psychologist, or dentist shall be obtained and
80 submitted as supporting documentation of need.

82 parent or parents may receive through an 18+ adoption subsidy under subsection 3 of
83 this section, including any cost-of-living adjustments.
84 5. To be eligible for any subsidy provided under this section, the adoptive parent
85 or parents shall be Missouri residents.
86 6. (1) At the request of the adoptive parent, the existing subsidies under this
87 section may be rewritten.

90 received for the child retroactive to the original placement within the home.
