17 regardless of the year in which such costs were incurred or whether such costs were
18 considered in any prior year. The assessor shall annually assess all real property in the
19 following manner: new assessed values shall be determined as of January first of each odd-
20 numbered year and shall be entered in the assessor's books; those same assessed values shall
21 apply in the following even-numbered year, except for new construction and property
22 improvementswhich shall be valued as though they had been completed as of Januaryfirst of
23 the preceding odd-numbered year. The assessor may call at the office, place of doing
24 business, or residence of each person required by this chapter to list property, and require the
25 person to make a correct statement of all taxable tangible personal property owned by the
26 person or under his or her care, charge or management, taxable in the county. On or before
27 January first of each even-numbered year, the assessor shall prepare and submit a two-year
28 assessment maintenance plan to the county governing body and the state tax commission for
29 their respective approval or modification. The county governing body shall approve and
30 forward such plan or its alternative to the plan to the state tax commission by February first.
31 If the county governing body fails to forward the plan or its alternative to the plan to the state
32 tax commission by February first, the assessor's plan shall be considered approved by the
33 countygoverning body. If the state tax commission fails to approve a plan and if the state tax
34 commission and the assessor and the governing body of the county involved are unable to
35 resolve the differences, in order to receive state cost-share funds outlined in section 137.750,
36 the county or the assessor shall petition the administrative hearing commission, by May first,
37 to decide all matters in dispute regarding the assessment maintenance plan. Upon agreement
38 of the parties, the matter may be stayed while the parties proceed with mediation or
39 arbitration upon terms agreed to by the parties. The final decision of the administrative
40 hearing commission shall be subject to judicial review in the circuit court of the county
41 involved. In the event a valuation of subclass (1) real property within any county with a
42 charter form of government, or within a city not within a county, is made by a computer,
43 computer-assisted method or a computer program, the burden of proof, supported by clear,
44 convincing and cogent evidence to sustain such valuation, shall be on the assessor at any
45 hearing or appeal. In any such county, unless the assessor proves otherwise, there shall be a
46 presumption that the assessment was made by a computer, computer-assisted method or a
47 computer program. Such evidence shall include, but shall not be limited to, the following:
48 (1) The findings of the assessor based on an appraisal of the property by generally
49 accepted appraisal techniques; and
50 (2) The purchase prices from sales of at least three comparable properties and the
51 address or location thereof. As used in this subdivision, the word "comparable" means that:
52 (a) Such sale was closed at a date relevant to the property valuation; and
HB 2401 3
53 (b) Such properties are not more than one mile from the site of the disputed property,
54 except where no similar properties exist within one mile of the disputed property, the nearest
55 comparable property shall be used. Such property shall be within five hundred square feet in

58 2. Assessors in each county of this state and the City of St. Louis may send personal
59 property assessment forms through the mail.
60 3. The following items of personal property shall each constitute separate subclasses
61 of tangible personal property and shall be assessed and valued for the purposes of taxation at
62 the following percentages of their true value in money:

64 one percent;

66 (3) Farm machinery, twelve percent;

81 property, in a printed blank prepared for that purpose. The statement, after being filled out,
82 shall be signed and either affirmed or sworn to as provided in section 137.155. The list shall
83 then be delivered to the assessor.

90 (2) A taxpayer may apply to the county assessor, or, if not located within a county,
91 thentheassessorofsuchcity,forthereclassificationofsuchtaxpayer'srealpropertyiftheuse
92 or purpose of such real property is changed after such property is assessed under the
93 provisions of this chapter. If the assessor determines that such property shall be reclassified,
94 he or she shall determine the assessment under this subsection based on the percentage of the
95 tax year that such property was classified in each subclassification.
96 6. Manufactured homes, as defined in section 700.010, which are actually used as
97 dwelling units shall be assessed at the same percentage of true value as residential real
98 property for the purpose of taxation. The percentage of assessment of true value for such
99 manufactured homes shall be the same as for residential real property. If the county collector
100 cannot identify or find the manufactured home when attempting to attach the manufactured
101 home for payment of taxes owed by the manufactured home owner, the county collector may
102 request the county commission to have the manufactured home removed from the tax books,
103 and such request shall be granted within thirty days after the request is made; however, the
104 removal from the tax books does not remove the tax lien on the manufactured home if it is
105 later identified or found. For purposes of this section, a manufactured home located in a
106 manufactured home rental park, rental community or on real estate not owned by the
107 manufactured home owner shall be considered personal property. For purposes of this
108 section, a manufactured home located on real estate owned by the manufactured home owner
109 may be considered real property.
110 7. Each manufactured home assessed shall be considered a parcel for the purpose of
111 reimbursement pursuant to section 137.750, unless the manufactured home is deemed to be
112 realestate asdefined in subsection7 of section442.015 and assessedas a realtyimprovement
113 to the existing real estate parcel.
114 8. Any amount of tax due and owing based on the assessment of a manufactured
115 home shall be included on the personal property tax statement of the manufactured home
116 owner unless the manufactured home is deemed to be real estate as defined in subsection 7 of
117 section 442.015, in which case the amount of tax due and owing on the assessment of the
118 manufactured home as a realty improvement to the existing real estate parcel shall be
119 included on the real property tax statement of the real estate owner.

124 not use a value that is greater than the average trade-in value in determining the true value of
125 themotorvehiclewithoutperformingaphysicalinspectionofthemotorvehicle. Forvehicles
126 two years old or newer from a vehicle's model year, the assessor may use a value other than
HB 2401 5
127 average without performing a physical inspection of the motor vehicle. In the absence of a
128 listing for a particular motor vehicle in such publication, the assessor shall use such
129 information or publications which in the assessor's judgment will fairly estimate the true
130 value in money of the motor vehicle.
131 10. Before the assessor may increase the assessed valuation of any parcel of subclass
132 (1) real property by more than fifteen percent since the last assessment, excluding increases
133 due to new construction or improvements, the assessor shall conduct a physical inspection of
134 such property.
135 11. If a physical inspection is required, pursuant to subsection 10 of this section, the
136 assessor shall notify the property owner of that fact in writing and shall provide the owner
137 clear written notice of the owner's rights relating to the physical inspection. If a physical
138 inspection is required, the property owner may request that an interior inspection be
139 performed during the physical inspection. The owner shall have no less than thirty days to
140 notify the assessor of a request for an interior physical inspection.
