177 within the special district and not in the district of residence for purposes of distributing the
178 state aid derived from the special education pupil count;
179 (17) "Special education threshold" shall be calculated by dividing the total special

191 The recalculation shall never result in a decrease from the state adequacy target as calculated
192 for fiscal years 2017 and 2018 and any state adequacy target figure calculated subsequent to
193 fiscal year 2018. Should a recalculation result in an increase in the state adequacy target
194 amount, fifty percent of that increase shall be included in the state adequacy target amount in
195 the year of recalculation, and fifty percent of that increase shall be included in the state
