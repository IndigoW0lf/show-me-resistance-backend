2 one new section, to be known as section 393.2200, to read as
3 follows:
1 393.2200. 1. As used in this section:
2 (1) "Commission", the public service commission
3 established under section 386.040;
4 (2) "Electrical corporation", the same as defined in
5 section 386.020, but shall not include an electrical
6 corporation as described in subsection 2 of section 393.110;
7 (3) "Generating facility", any electric generating
8 plant or improvement to existing electricity generation
9 facilities;
10 (4) "Stake", an electrical corporation's whole or
11 fractional ownership share or leasehold or other proprietary
12 interest in a generating facility or transmission facility
13 that may be acquired by construction, purchase, lease or
14 other means;
15 (5) "Transmission facility":
16 (a) Any existing line, and supporting structures and
17 equipment, being upgraded for the transmission of
18 electricity with an operating voltage of one hundred
19 kilovolts or more of electricity; or
SB 1247 2
20 (b) Any new line, and supporting structures and
21 equipment, being constructed for the transmission of
22 electricity with an operating voltage of one hundred
23 kilovolts or more of electricity;
24 (6) "Weighted average cost of capital", the return on
25 rate base used to determine the revenue requirement in the
26 electrical corporation's most recently completed general
27 rate proceeding; provided, that in the absence of a
28 commission determination of the return on rate base within
29 the three-year period prior to August 28, 2024, the weighted
30 average cost of capital shall be determined using the
31 electrical corporation's actual capital structure as of
32 December 31, 2023, excluding short-term debt, the electrical
33 corporation's actual cost of long-term debt and preferred
34 stock as of December 31, 2023, and a cost of common equity
35 of nine and one-half percent.
36 2. (1) Prior to acquiring a stake in a transmission
37 facility, an electrical corporation may file with the
38 commission an application for a determination of the rate-
39 making principles and treatment, as proposed by the
40 electrical corporation, that will apply to the reflection in
41 rates of the cost to be incurred by the electrical
42 corporation to acquire such electrical corporation's stake
43 in the transmission facility during the expected useful life
44 of the transmission facility.
45 (2) Unless the commission determines that the
46 electrical corporation's stake in the transmission facility
47 is not reasonable, the commission shall issue an order
48 setting forth the rate-making principles and treatment that
49 will be applicable to the electrical corporation's stake in
50 the transmission facility in all rate-making proceedings on
SB 1247 3
51 and after such time as the transmission facility is placed
52 in service.
53 (3) The commission in all proceedings in which the
54 cost of the electrical corporation's stake in the
55 transmission facility is considered shall utilize the rate-
56 making principles and treatment applicable to the
57 transmission facility.
58 (4) If the commission fails to issue a determination
59 within one hundred eighty days of the date an application
60 for a determination of rate-making principles and treatment
61 is filed, the rate-making principles and treatment proposed
62 by the electrical corporation making such application will
63 be deemed to have been approved by the commission and shall
64 be binding for rate-making purposes during the useful life
65 of the transmission facility.
66 (5) If the electrical corporation's acquisition of a
67 stake in a transmission facility requires a certificate of
68 convenience and necessity under the provisions of subsection
69 1 of section 393.170, the electrical corporation may elect
70 to request such certificate by filing an application in the
71 same proceeding in which the application for a determination
72 of rate-making principles and treatment is filed. In that
73 event, if the commission fails to issue a determination
74 regarding the application for a certificate of convenience
75 and necessity within one hundred eighty days of the date
76 such application is filed, the application shall be deemed
77 to have been approved by the commission and shall be binding
78 for all purposes.
79 3. (1) Prior to acquiring a stake in a generating
80 facility, or prior to retiring or abandoning a generating
81 facility, or within a reasonable time after retirement or
82 abandonment if filing before retirement or abandonment is
SB 1247 4
83 not possible under the circumstances, an electrical
84 corporation may file with the commission an application for
85 a determination of the rate-making principles and treatment,
86 as proposed by the electrical corporation, that will apply
87 to:
88 (a) Reflection in rates of the cost to be incurred by
89 the electrical corporation to acquire such electrical
90 corporation's stake in the generating facility during the
91 expected useful life of the generating facility; or
92 (b) Reflection in rates of the costs to be incurred
93 and the cost savings to be achieved by the electrical
94 corporation in retiring or abandoning such electrical
95 corporation's stake in the generating facility, including,
96 but not limited to, the reasonableness of such retirement or
97 abandonment.
98 (2) Any electrical corporation seeking a determination
99 of rate-making principles and treatment under subsection 3
100 of this section shall as a part of its filing describe how
101 its stake in the generating facility is consistent with the
102 electrical corporation's most recent preferred plan as the
103 term "preferred plan" is used under the provisions of
104 Chapter 22 of 20 CSR 4240 as of December 31, 2023.
105 (3) In considering the electrical corporation's
106 preferred plan, the commission may consider if the
107 electrical corporation issued a request for proposal for
108 generating facilities from a wide audience of participants
109 willing and able to meet the needs identified under the
110 electrical corporation's preferred plan, and if the plan
111 selected by the electrical corporation is reasonable.
112 (4) Unless the commission determines that the
113 electrical corporation's stake in the generating facility is
114 not reasonable, the commission shall issue an order setting
SB 1247 5
115 forth the rate-making principles and treatment that will be
116 applicable to the electrical corporation's stake in the
117 generating facility in all rate-making proceedings and any
118 securitization proceeding under section 393.1700 respecting
119 the electrical corporation's stake in the generating
120 facility on and after such time as the generating facility
121 is:
122 (a) Placed in service on the utility's books; or
123 (b) Retired or abandoned.
124 (5) With respect to a new gas-fired generating
125 facility or a new small modular nuclear generating facility,
126 unless the commission timely elects not to set forth
127 ratemaking principles applicable in the future on the
128 grounds that acquiring a stake in such a generating facility
129 is not reasonable, then notwithstanding any other provisions
130 of this chapter to the contrary, including but not limited
131 to the provisions of section 393.135, the electrical
132 corporation shall be permitted, at its election, to
133 implement a new rate adjustment mechanism, to become
134 effective not sooner than three hundred sixty-five days
135 after construction of such a generating facility begins and
136 within thirty days after filing by the electrical
137 corporation, designed to recover the return on one hundred
138 percent of amounts recorded to construction work in progress
139 on the utility's books for the electrical corporation's
140 stake in such a generating facility at the weighted average
141 cost of capital without offset, adjustment, or reduction for
142 any other issue or consideration, provided that such return
143 shall be in lieu of any otherwise applicable allowance for
144 funds used during construction that would have accrued from
145 and after the effective date of such rate adjustment
146 mechanism. Such rate adjustment mechanism shall be subject
SB 1247 6
147 to periodic increases, without adjustment, offset, or
148 reduction for any other issue or consideration, no more
149 frequently than every six months, as construction of the
150 electrical corporation's stake in such a generating facility
151 continues and the balance of construction work in progress
152 grows. Customers shall be charged under such rate
153 adjustment mechanism until such time as new base rates
154 reflecting the electrical corporation's investment in such a
155 generating facility take effect, with such base rates to
156 include carrying costs on any unrecovered portion of such
157 investment at the electrical corporation's weighted average
158 cost of capital as determined in the proceeding setting such
159 base rates between the date such generating facility was
160 placed in service on the electrical corporation's books and
161 the effective date of base rates in such proceeding. Such
162 new rate adjustment mechanism shall be permitted to remain
163 in effect for a period not to exceed six years.
164 (6) As an alternative to the rate adjustment mechanism
165 authorized under subdivision (5) of this subsection for a
166 new gas-fired generating facility or a new small modular
167 nuclear generating facility, unless the commission timely
168 elects not to set forth ratemaking principles applicable in
169 the future on the grounds that acquiring a stake in such a
170 generating facility is not reasonable, the electrical
171 corporation shall be permitted, at its election, to
172 implement a new temporary rate, to become effective no later
173 than thirty days after such a generating facility is placed
174 in-service on the utility's books, designed to recover one
175 hundred percent of the depreciation expense and the return
176 on rate base on the electrical corporation's stake in such a
177 generating facility at the electrical corporation's
178 weighted average cost of capital plus applicable federal,
SB 1247 7
179 state, and local income or excise taxes, and reduced for the
180 effects of accumulated deferred income taxes created by such
181 a generating facility, without adjustment, offset, or
182 reduction for any other issue or consideration. Such rate
183 element shall be permitted to remain in effect for a period
184 not to exceed three hundred sixty-five days. Customers
185 shall be charged under such rate element until such time as
186 new base rates reflecting the electrical corporation's
187 investment in such a generating facility take effect.
188 (7) The commission in all proceedings in which the
189 cost of the electrical corporation's stake in the generating
190 facility is considered shall utilize the rate-making
191 principles and treatment applicable to the generating
192 facility or retired or abandoned generating facility.
193 (8) If the commission fails to issue a determination
194 within one hundred eighty days of the date an application
195 for a determination of rate-making principles and treatment
196 is filed, the rate-making principles and treatment proposed
197 by the electrical corporation making such application will
198 be deemed to have been approved by the commission and shall
199 be binding for rate-making purposes during the useful life
200 of the generating facility, or during the period when the
201 cost of the retired or abandoned generating facility is
202 reflected in customer rates.
203 (9) If the electrical corporation's acquisition of a
204 stake in a generation facility requires a certificate of
205 convenience and necessity under the provisions of subsection
206 1 of section 393.170, the electrical corporation may elect
207 to request such certificate by filing an application in the
208 same proceeding in which the application for a determination
209 of rate-making principles and treatment is filed. In that
210 event, if the commission fails to issue a determination
SB 1247 8
211 regarding the application for a certificate of convenience
212 and necessity within one hundred eighty days of the date
213 such application is filed, the application shall be deemed
214 to have been approved by the commission and shall be binding
215 for all purposes.
216 4. In making its determination as to whether acquiring
217 a stake in the generating facility is reasonable and
218 necessary or convenient for the public service under
219 subsection 1 of section 393.170, if applicable, the
220 commission shall be guided by the fact that it is in the
221 interest of the state of Missouri for electrical
222 corporations to ensure that they own and operate sufficient
223 generating resources to serve their retail load without
224 undue reliance on any power pool, regional transmission
225 operator or independent system operator market, or other
226 resources not owned or controlled by the electrical
227 corporation.
228 5. The electrical corporation shall have one year from
229 the effective date of the determination of the commission to
230 notify the commission whether it will acquire a stake in the
231 generating facility or transmission facility, or whether it
232 will retire or abandon the generating facility.
233 6. If the electrical corporation notifies the
234 commission within the one-year period that the electrical
235 corporation will not construct or participate in the
236 construction of the generating or transmission facility, or
237 that it will not retire or abandon the generating facility,
238 then the determination of rate-making principles pursuant to
239 subsections 2 or 3 of this section shall be of no further
240 force or effect, shall have no precedential value in any
241 subsequent proceeding, and there shall be no adverse
SB 1247 9
242 presumption applied in any future proceeding as a result of
243 such notification.
244 7. If the electrical corporation notifies the
245 commission under subsection 5 of this section that it will
246 acquire a stake in a generating facility and subsequently
247 does not, or that it will retire or abandon a generating
248 facility and subsequently does not, it will be required to
249 notify the commission immediately by making a filing in the
250 proceeding it initiated under this section and provide a
251 notification of a change in preferred resource plan
252 consistent with the requirements of 20 CSR 4240-22.080(12)
253 as those requirements exist on December 31, 2023.
