Section A. Section 137.115, RSMo, is repealed and one new section enacted in lieu
2 thereof, to be known as section 137.115, to read as follows:
137.115. 1. All other laws to the contrary notwithstanding, the assessor or the
2 assessor's deputies in all counties of this state including the City of St. Louis shall annually
3 make a list of all real and tangible personal property taxable in the assessor's city, county,
4 town or district. Except as otherwise provided in subsection 3 of this section and section
5 137.078, the assessor shall annually assess all personal property at thirty-three and one-third
6 percentofits truevalueinmoneyasofJanuaryfirst ofeachcalendaryear. Theassessorshall
7 annually assess all real property, including any new construction and improvements to real
8 property, and possessory interests in real property at the percent of its true value in money set

10 property in subclass (3), where such real property is on or lies within the ultimate airport
11 boundary as shown by a federal airport layout plan, as defined by 14 CFR 151.5, of a
12 commercial airport having a FAR Part 139 certification and owned by a political subdivision,
13 shall be the otherwise applicable true value in money of any such possessory interest in real
14 property, less the total dollar amount of costs paid by a party, other than the political
15 subdivision, towards any new construction or improvements on such real property completed

HB 1690 2
18 considered in any prior year. The assessor shall annually assess all real property in the
19 following manner: new assessed values shall be determined as of January first of each odd-
20 numbered year and shall be entered in the assessor's books; those same assessed values shall
21 apply in the following even-numbered year, except for new construction and property
22 improvementswhich shall be valued as though they had been completed as of Januaryfirst of
23 the preceding odd-numbered year. The assessor may call at the office, place of doing
24 business, or residence of each person required by this chapter to list property, and require the
25 person to make a correct statement of all taxable tangible personal property owned by the
26 person or under his or her care, charge or management, taxable in the county. On or before
27 January first of each even-numbered year, the assessor shall prepare and submit a two-year
28 assessment maintenance plan to the county governing body and the state tax commission for
29 their respective approval or modification. The county governing body shall approve and
30 forward such plan or its alternative to the plan to the state tax commission by February first.
31 If the county governing body fails to forward the plan or its alternative to the plan to the state
32 tax commission by February first, the assessor's plan shall be considered approved by the
33 countygoverning body. If the state tax commission fails to approve a plan and if the state tax
34 commission and the assessor and the governing body of the county involved are unable to
35 resolve the differences, in order to receive state cost-share funds outlined in section 137.750,
36 the county or the assessor shall petition the administrative hearing commission, by May first,
37 to decide all matters in dispute regarding the assessment maintenance plan. Upon agreement
38 of the parties, the matter may be stayed while the parties proceed with mediation or
39 arbitration upon terms agreed to by the parties. The final decision of the administrative
40 hearing commission shall be subject to judicial review in the circuit court of the county
41 involved. In the event a valuation of subclass (1) real property within any county with a
42 charter form of government, or within a city not within a county, is made by a computer,
43 computer-assisted method or a computer program, the burden of proof, supported by clear,
44 convincing and cogent evidence to sustain such valuation, shall be on the assessor at any
45 hearing or appeal. In any such county, unless the assessor proves otherwise, there shall be a
46 presumption that the assessment was made by a computer, computer-assisted method or a
47 computer program. Such evidence shall include, but shall not be limited to, the following:
48 (1) The findings of the assessor based on an appraisal of the property by generally
49 accepted appraisal techniques; and
50 (2) The purchase prices from sales of at least three comparable properties and the
51 address or location thereof. As used in this subdivision, the word "comparable" means that:
52 (a) Such sale was closed at a date relevant to the property valuation; and
53 (b) Such properties are not more than one mile from the site of the disputed property,
54 except where no similar properties exist within one mile of the disputed property, the nearest
HB 1690 3
55 comparable property shall be used. Such property shall be within five hundred square feet in
56 sizeofthedisputedproperty,andresemblethedisputedpropertyinage,floorplan,numberof
57 rooms, and other relevant characteristics.
58 2. Assessors in each county of this state and the City of St. Louis may send personal
59 property assessment forms through the mail.
60 3. The following items of personal property shall each constitute separate subclasses
61 of tangible personal property and shall be assessed and valued for the purposes of taxation at
62 the following percentages of their true value in money:
63 (1) Grain and other agricultural crops in an unmanufactured condition, one-half of
64 one percent;
65 (2) Livestock, twelve percent;
66 (3) Farm machinery, twelve percent;
67 (4) Motor vehicles which are eligible for registration as and are registered as historic
68 motor vehicles pursuant to section 301.131 and aircraft which are at least twenty-five years
69 old and which are used solely for noncommercial purposes and are operated less than two
70 hundred hours per year or aircraft that are home built from a kit, five percent;
71 (5) Poultry, twelve percent; and
72 (6) Tools and equipment used for pollution control and tools and equipment used in
73 retooling for the purpose of introducing new product lines or used for making improvements
74 to existing products by any company which is located in a state enterprise zone and which is
75 identified by any standard industrial classification number cited in subdivision (7) of section
76 135.200, twenty-five percent.
77 4. The person listing the property shall enter a true and correct statement of the
78 property, in a printed blank prepared for that purpose. The statement, after being filled out,
79 shall be signed and either affirmed or sworn to as provided in section 137.155. The list shall
80 then be delivered to the assessor.
81 5. (1) All subclasses of real property, as such subclasses are established in Section 4
82 (b)ofArticleXoftheMissouriConstitutionanddefinedinsection137.016,shallbeassessed
83 at the following percentages of true value:
84 (a) For real property in subclass (1), nineteen percent;
85 (b) For real property in subclass (2), twelve percent; and
86 (c) For real property in subclass (3), thirty-two percent.
87 (2) A taxpayer may apply to the county assessor, or, if not located within a county,
88 thentheassessorofsuchcity,forthereclassificationofsuchtaxpayer'srealpropertyiftheuse
89 or purpose of such real property is changed after such property is assessed under the
90 provisions of this chapter. If the assessor determines that such property shall be reclassified,
HB 1690 4
91 he or she shall determine the assessment under this subsection based on the percentage of the
92 tax year that such property was classified in each subclassification.
93 6. Manufactured homes, as defined in section 700.010, which are actually used as
94 dwelling units shall be assessed at the same percentage of true value as residential real
95 property for the purpose of taxation. The percentage of assessment of true value for such
96 manufactured homes shall be the same as for residential real property. If the county collector
97 cannot identify or find the manufactured home when attempting to attach the manufactured
98 home for payment of taxes owed by the manufactured home owner, the county collector may
99 request the county commission to have the manufactured home removed from the tax books,
100 and such request shall be granted within thirty days after the request is made; however, the
101 removal from the tax books does not remove the tax lien on the manufactured home if it is
102 later identified or found. For purposes of this section, a manufactured home located in a
103 manufactured home rental park, rental community or on real estate not owned by the
104 manufactured home owner shall be considered personal property. For purposes of this
105 section, a manufactured home located on real estate owned by the manufactured home owner
106 may be considered real property.
107 7. Each manufactured home assessed shall be considered a parcel for the purpose of
108 reimbursement pursuant to section 137.750, unless the manufactured home is deemed to be
109 realestate asdefined in subsection7 of section442.015 and assessedas a realtyimprovement
110 to the existing real estate parcel.
111 8. Any amount of tax due and owing based on the assessment of a manufactured
112 home shall be included on the personal property tax statement of the manufactured home
113 owner unless the manufactured home is deemed to be real estate as defined in subsection 7 of
114 section 442.015, in which case the amount of tax due and owing on the assessment of the
115 manufactured home as a realty improvement to the existing real estate parcel shall be
116 included on the real property tax statement of the real estate owner.
117 9. (1) To determine the true value in money for motor vehicles, the assessor of
118 each county and each city not within a county shall use the trade-in value published in the
119 October issue of [the National Automobile Dealers' Association Official Used Car Guide, or
120 its successor publication, as the recommended guide of information for determining the true
121 value of motor vehicles described in such publication. The assessor shall not use a value that
122 is greater than the average trade-in value in determining the true value of the motor vehicle
123 without performing a physical inspection of the motor vehicle. For vehicles two years old or
124 newer from a vehicle's model year, the assessor may use a value other than average without
125 performing a physical inspection of the motor vehicle.] a nationally recognized automotive
126 trade publication selected by the state tax commission. The assessor shall not use a
127 value that is greater than the average trade-in value for such motor vehicle without
HB 1690 5
128 performing a physical inspection of the motor vehicle. For vehicles two years of age or
129 newer from a vehicle's model year, the assessor may use a value other than the average
130 without performing a physical inspection of the motor vehicle. In the absence of a listing
131 for a particular motor vehicle in such publication, the assessor shall use such information or
132 publications [which] that, in the assessor's judgment, will fairly estimate the true value in
133 money of the motor vehicle.
134 (2) (a) For all tax years beginning on or after January 1, 2025, the assessor shall
135 apply the following depreciation schedule to the trade-in value of the motor vehicle as
136 determined under subdivision (1) of this subsection:

160 valuation tables used prior to October 1, 2024, are fair valuations and these valuations
161 shall be depreciated from the table provided in subdivision (2) of this subsection until
162 the end of their useful life. The state tax commission shall secure an annual
163 appropriation from the general assembly for the publication used under subdivision (1)
164 of this subsection. The state tax commission or the state of Missouri shall be the
165 registered user of the publication with rights to allow all assessors access to the
166 publication. The publication shall be available to all vendors by December fifteenth of

168 10. Before the assessor may increase the assessed valuation of any parcel of subclass
169 (1) real property by more than fifteen percent since the last assessment, excluding increases
170 due to new construction or improvements, the assessor shall conduct a physical inspection of
171 such property.
172 11. If a physical inspection is required, pursuant to subsection 10 of this section, the
173 assessor shall notify the property owner of that fact in writing and shall provide the owner
174 clear written notice of the owner's rights relating to the physical inspection. If a physical
175 inspection is required, the property owner may request that an interior inspection be
176 performed during the physical inspection. The owner shall have no less than thirty days to
177 notify the assessor of a request for an interior physical inspection.
178 12. A physical inspection, as required by subsection 10 of this section, shall include,
