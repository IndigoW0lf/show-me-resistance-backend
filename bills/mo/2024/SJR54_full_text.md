JOINT RESOLUTION
Submitting to the qualified voters of Missouri, an amendment repealing section 2 of article III of
the Constitution of Missouri, and adopting one new section in lieu thereof relating to
repealing restrictions on legislative staff acting, serving, or registering as a lobbyist
after legislative employment.
Be it resolved by the Senate, the House of Representatives concurring therein:
1 That at the next general election to be held in the
2 state of Missouri, on Tuesday next following the first Monday
3 in November, 2024, or at a special election to be called by
4 the governor for that purpose, there is hereby submitted to
5 the qualified voters of this state, for adoption or
6 rejection, the following amendment to article III of the
7 Constitution of the state of Missouri:
1 Section A. Section 2, article III, Constitution of
2 Missouri, is repealed and one new section adopted in lieu
3 thereof, to be known as section 2, to read as follows:
1 Section 2. (a) After December 6, 2018, no person
2 serving as a member of [or employed by] the general assembly
3 shall act or serve as a paid lobbyist, register as a paid
4 lobbyist, or solicit prospective employers or clients to
5 represent as a paid lobbyist during the time of such service
6 until the expiration of two calendar years after the
7 conclusion of the session of the general assembly in which
8 the member [or employee] last served and where such service
9 was after December 6, 2018.
EXPLANATION-Matter enclosed in bold-faced brackets [thus] in this bill is not enacted
and is intended to be omitted in the law.
SJR 54 2
10 (b) No person serving as a member of or employed by
11 the general assembly shall accept directly or indirectly a
12 gift of any tangible or intangible item, service, or thing
13 of value from any paid lobbyist or lobbyist principal. This
14 Article shall not prevent candidates for the general
15 assembly, including candidates for reelection, or candidates
16 for offices within the senate or house from accepting
17 campaign contributions consistent with this Article and
18 applicable campaign finance law. Nothing in this section
19 shall prevent individuals from receiving gifts, family
20 support or anything of value from those related to them
21 within the fourth degree by blood or marriage.
22 (c) The general assembly shall make no law authorizing
23 unlimited campaign contributions to candidates for the
24 general assembly, nor any law that circumvents the
25 contribution limits contained in this Constitution. In
26 addition to other campaign contribution limitations or
27 restrictions provided for by law, the amount of
28 contributions made to or accepted by any candidate or
29 candidate committee from any person other than the candidate
30 in any one election to the office of state representative or
31 state senator shall not exceed the following:
32 (1) To elect an individual to the office of state
33 senator, two thousand four hundred dollars; and
34 (2) To elect an individual to the office of state
35 representative, two thousand dollars.
36 The contribution limits and other restrictions of this
37 section shall also apply to any person exploring a candidacy
38 for the office of state representative or state senator.
39 (d) No contribution to a candidate for legislative
40 office shall be made or accepted, directly or indirectly, in
41 a fictitious name, in the name of another person, or by or
SJR 54 3
42 through another person in such a manner as to, or with the
43 intent to, conceal the identity of the actual source of the
44 contribution. There shall be a rebuttable presumption that
45 a contribution to a candidate for public office is made or
46 accepted with the intent to circumvent the limitations on
47 contributions imposed in this section when a contribution is
48 received from a committee or organization that is primarily
49 funded by a single person, individual, or other committee
50 that has already reached its contribution limit under any
51 law relating to contribution limitations. A committee or
52 organization shall be deemed to be primarily funded by a
53 single person, individual, or other committee when the
54 committee or organization receives more than fifty percent
55 of its annual funding from that single person, individual,
56 or other committee.
57 (e) In no circumstance shall a candidate be found to
58 have violated limits on acceptance of contributions if the
59 Missouri ethics commission, its successor agency, or a court
60 determines that a candidate has taken no action to indicate
61 acceptance of or acquiescence to the making of an
62 expenditure that is deemed a contribution pursuant to this
63 section.
64 (f) No candidate shall accept contributions from any
65 federal political action committee unless the committee has
66 filed the same financial disclosure reports that would be
67 required of a Missouri political action committee.
