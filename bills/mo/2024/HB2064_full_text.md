95 mental health disorder treatment to participants who have served or are currently serving the

98 combat service shall be shown through military service documentation that reflects service in
99 a combat theater, receipt of combat service medals, or receipt of imminent danger or hostile
100 fire pay or tax benefits. Except for good cause found by the court, a veterans treatment court
101 shall make a referral for substance use or mental health disorder treatment, or a combination
102 of substance use and mental health disorder treatment, through the Department of Defense
103 health care, the Veterans Administration, or a community-based substance use disorder
104 treatment program. Community-based programs utilized shall receive state or federal funds
105 in connection with such referral and shall only refer the individual to a program certified by
106 the department of mental health, unless no appropriate certified treatment program is located
107 within the same circuit as the veterans treatment court.
108 8. A mental health court may be established by any circuit court to provide an
109 alternative for the judicial system to dispose of cases that stem from a mental health
110 disorder or co-occurring disorder.
