WHEREAS, the Second Amendment to the United States Constitution recognizes a
2 pre-existing, God-given right of the people to keep and bear arms, which necessarily includes

5 WHEREAS, Article I, Section 23 of the Missouri Constitution protects this same
6 right of the citizens with an explicit inclusion of ammunition; and

13 anywhere in the world should be the single most critical concern of the federal government;
14 and
15

17 security role by providing our military forces with the tools and equipment necessary to keep
18 our country and countless others free from tyranny and evil; and

21 Ammunition Plant here in the Show-Me State, providing vital ammunition to the fighting

31 estimated 470 million firearms responsibly and legally every single day of the year without
32 recognition or fanfare; and
33
34 WHEREAS, research suggests that firearms of every type are used up to 2.5 million
35 times every year in America to defend against violence; and
36
37 WHEREAS, emotional calls from public policymakers to halt commercial sales of
38 surplus ammunition from the Lake City Army Ammunition Plant should be summarily
39 rejected in order to maintain adequate supplies of ammunition to the American public and,
40 critically, to maintain United States military preparedness; and
41
42 WHEREAS, a prohibition on the commercial sale of this ammunition would result in
43 the loss of up to 700 jobs in the Lake City Army Ammunition Plant, detrimentally affecting
44 hundreds of hardworking families living in this state; and
45
46 WHEREAS, the Missouri General Assembly supports the patriotic workers of the
47 Lake City Army Ammunition Plant and their contribution to the exercise of the citizens'
48 constitutional right to keep and bear arms and to national defense:

57 Representatives be instructed to prepare a properly inscribed copy of this resolution for each
