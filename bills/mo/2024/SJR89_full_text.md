1 Section 24. 1. The governor shall, within thirty days

3 general assembly a budget for the ensuing appropriation
4 period, containing the estimated available revenues of the
5 state and a complete and itemized plan of proposed
6 expenditures of the state and all its agencies, and the
7 itemized plan of proposed expenditures shall not exceed the
8 estimated available revenues. The governor shall not

SJR 89 2
11 legislation that has not been passed into law by the general
12 assembly. Estimates of any unspent fund balances, without
13 regard to actual or estimated revenues but accounting for
14 all existing appropriations, that will constitute a surplus
15 during the fiscal year immediately preceding the fiscal year
16 or years for which the governor is recommending a budget,
17 [may] shall not be included in the estimated revenue
18 available for expenditure during the fiscal year or years
19 for which the governor is recommending a budget. As used in
20 this section, new revenues shall not include existing
21 provisions of law subject to expiration during the ensuing
22 appropriation period.
23 2. For the purposes of subsection 1 of this section,
24 "estimated available revenues" shall include all state
25 revenues and federal funds, but shall not include the
26 proceeds of any debt incurred pursuant to this constitution
27 or state law, or any portion of federal funds obtained
28 through debt incurred by the federal government.
29 3. The general assembly may, by general law, provide
30 for the return to the taxpayers of any unspent fund balances
31 that constitute a surplus during the fiscal year immediately
32 preceding the fiscal year or years for which the governor is
33 recommending a budget.
1 Section 27. 1. The governor may control the rate at
2 which any appropriation is expended during the period of the
3 appropriation by allotment and [may] shall reduce the
4 expenditures of the state or any of its agencies below their
5 appropriations whenever the actual revenues are less than
6 the revenue estimates upon which the appropriations were
7 based. The governor shall not reduce any appropriation for
8 the payment of principal and interest on the public debt.
SJR 89 3
9 2. The governor shall notify the general assembly by
10 proclamation whenever the rate at which any appropriation
11 shall be expended is not equal quarterly allotments, the sum
12 of which shall be equal to the amount of the appropriation.
13 Any rate of expenditure for any appropriation which is not
14 equal quarterly allotments shall stand reconsidered in the
15 chamber in which the bill that contained the appropriation
16 originated. Such reconsideration shall be in the manner
17 that a bill is reconsidered under article III, section 32.
18 Either the general assembly that receives the proclamation
19 or the next general assembly may reconsider the rate of
20 expenditure. If the general assembly successfully
21 reconsiders the rate of expenditure for the appropriation in
22 question, the rate shall be assumed to be equal quarterly
23 allotments. Such reconsideration may be at any time the
24 general assembly is in session including sessions pursuant
25 to article III, sections 20, 20(b), and 32 and article IV,
26 section 9. Either the general assembly that receives the
27 proclamation or the next general assembly may reconsider
28 such allotment allocation change. Such reconsideration may
29 be at any time the general assembly is in session including
30 sessions pursuant to article III, sections 20, 20(b), and 32
31 and article IV, section 9.
32 3. The governor shall notify the general assembly by
33 proclamation when the governor reduces one or more items or
34 portions of items of appropriation of money as a result of
35 actual revenues being less than the revenue estimates upon
36 which the appropriations were based. Each item or portions
37 of items of appropriation of money shall stand reconsidered
38 in the chamber in which the bill that contained the
39 appropriation originated. Such reconsideration shall be in
40 the manner that a bill is reconsidered under article III,
SJR 89 4
41 section 32. Either the general assembly that receives the
42 proclamation or the next general assembly may reconsider
43 such reduction. Such reconsideration may be at any time the
44 general assembly is in session including sessions pursuant
45 to article III, sections 20, 20(b), and 32 and article IV,
46 section 9.
