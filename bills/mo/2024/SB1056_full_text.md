242 if any of the powers vested with the general assembly
243 pursuant to chapter 536 to review, to delay the effective
244 date, or to disapprove and annul a rule are subsequently
245 held unconstitutional, then the grant of rulemaking
246 authority and any rule proposed or adopted after August 28,
247 2019, shall be invalid and void.
