AN ACT
To repeal sections 142.803 and 142.822, RSMo, and to enact in lieu thereof one new section
relating to the motor fuel tax.
Be it enacted by the General Assembly of the State of Missouri, as follows:
1 Section A. Sections 142.803 and 142.822, RSMo, are
2 repealed and one new section enacted in lieu thereof, to be
3 known as section 142.803, to read as follows:
1 142.803. 1. A tax is levied and imposed on all motor
2 fuel used or consumed in this state as follows:
3 (1) Motor fuel, seventeen cents per gallon;
4 (2) Alternative fuels, not subject to the decal fees
5 as provided in section 142.869, with a power potential
6 equivalent of motor fuel. In the event alternative fuel,
7 which is not commonly sold or measured by the gallon, is
8 used in motor vehicles on the highways of this state, the
9 director is authorized to assess and collect a tax upon such
10 alternative fuel measured by the nearest power potential
11 equivalent to that of one gallon of regular grade gasoline.
12 The determination by the director of the power potential
13 equivalent of such alternative fuel shall be prima facie
14 correct;
15 (3) Aviation fuel used in propelling aircraft with
16 reciprocating engines, nine cents per gallon as levied and
17 imposed by section 155.080 to be collected as required under
18 this chapter;

24 equivalent and method of sale for compressed natural gas
25 shall be as published by the National Institute of Standards
26 and Technology in Handbooks 44 and 130, and supplements
27 thereto or revisions thereof. In the absence of such
28 standard or agreement, the gasoline gallon equivalent and
29 method of sale for compressed natural gas shall be equal to

31 gas. All applicable provisions contained in this chapter

40 gallon equivalent thereafter. The diesel gallon equivalent
41 and method of sale for liquefied natural gas shall be as
42 published by the National Institute of Standards and
43 Technology in Handbooks 44 and 130, and supplements thereto
44 or revisions thereof. In the absence of such standard or
45 agreement, the diesel gallon equivalent and method of sale
46 for liquefied natural gas shall be equal to six and six-
47 hundredths pounds of liquefied natural gas. All applicable
48 provisions contained in this chapter governing
49 administration, collections, and enforcement of the state
50 motor fuel tax shall apply to the tax imposed on liquefied

57 this chapter governing administration, collection, and
58 enforcement of the state motor fuel tax shall apply to the
59 tax imposed on propane gas including, but not limited to,
60 licensing, reporting, penalties, and interest;
61 (7) If a natural gas, compressed natural gas,
62 liquefied natural gas, electric, or propane connection is
63 used for fueling motor vehicles and for another use, such as
64 heating, the tax imposed by this section shall apply to the
65 entire amount of natural gas, compressed natural gas,
66 liquefied natural gas, electricity, or propane used unless
67 an approved separate metering and accounting system is in
68 place.

10 refund shall be issued on a fiscal year basis to
11 each person who pays the fuel tax collected
12 under subsection 3 of section 142.803 and who

16 collected in that fiscal year under subsection 3
17 of section 142.803.
18 2. To claim an exemption and refund in
19 accordance with this section, a person shall
20 present to the director a statement containing a
21 written verification that the claim is made
22 under penalty of perjury and that states the

29 for which the exemption and refund is claimed.
30 The claim statement may be submitted

32 the following information:
33 (1) Vehicle identification number of the
34 motor vehicle into which the motor fuel was
35 delivered;
36 (2) Date of sale;
37 (3) Name and address of purchaser;
38 (4) Name and address of seller;

46 exemption and refund of the motor fuel tax,
47 together with invoices, original sales receipts
48 marked paid by the seller, bills of lading, and
49 other pertinent records and paper as may be
50 required by the director for reasonable
51 administration of this chapter.
52 4. The director may make any investigation
53 necessary before issuing an exemption and refund
SB 953 5
54 under this section, and may investigate an
55 exemption and refund under this section after it
56 has been issued and within the time frame for
57 making adjustments to the tax pursuant to this
58 chapter.
59 5. If an exemption and refund is not
60 issued within forty-five days of an accurate and
61 complete filing, as required by this chapter,
62 the director shall pay interest at the rate
63 provided in section 32.065 accruing after the
64 expiration of the forty-five-day period until
65 the date the exemption and refund is issued.
66 6. The exemption and refund specified in
67 this section shall be available only with regard
68 to motor fuel delivered into a motor vehicle
69 with a gross weight, as defined in section
70 301.010, of twenty-six thousand pounds or less.
71 7. The director shall promulgate rules as
72 necessary to implement the provisions of this
73 section. Any rule or portion of a rule, as that
74 term is defined in section 536.010, that is
75 created under the authority delegated in this
76 section shall become effective only if it
77 complies with and is subject to all of the
78 provisions of chapter 536 and, if applicable,
79 section 536.028. This section and chapter 536
80 are nonseverable and if any of the powers vested
81 with the general assembly pursuant to chapter
82 536 to review, to delay the effective date, or
83 to disapprove and annul a rule are subsequently
84 held unconstitutional, then the grant of
85 rulemaking authority and any rule proposed or
86 adopted after August 28, 2021, shall be invalid
87 and void.]
