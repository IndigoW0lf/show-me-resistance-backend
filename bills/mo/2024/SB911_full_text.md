3 to read as follows:
1 407.932. [Nothing in sections 407.925 to 407.932 shall
2 prohibit local political subdivisions from enacting more
3 stringent ordinances or rules.] 1. The state preempts the
4 field of regulating the sale of tobacco products,
5 alternative nicotine products, and vapor products, and the
6 provisions of sections 407.924 to 407.934 shall supersede
7 any local laws, ordinances, orders, rules, or regulations

10 alternative nicotine products, or vapor products.
11 2. No political subdivision shall deny a license to a
12 qualified applicant for a tobacco products license, an
13 alternative nicotine products license, or a vapor products
14 license if the new license being sought is for the same
15 business or location that had a license within the previous
16 twenty-four months. Any new licensee shall remain eligible
17 for a tobacco products license, an alternative nicotine
18 products license, or a vapor products license, or the

24 licenses, or vapor products licenses issued by the political
25 subdivision.
