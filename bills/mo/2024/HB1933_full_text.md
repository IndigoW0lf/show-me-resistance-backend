211.447. 1. Any information that could justify the filing of a petition to terminate

11 division shall seek to be joined as a party to the petition, when:
12 (1) Information available to the juvenile officer or the division establishes that the
13 child has been in foster care for at least fifteen of the most recent twenty-two months; or
14 (2) A court of competent jurisdiction has determined the child to be an abandoned

21 parental support and without making arrangements to visit or communicate with the child,

36 3. A termination of parental rights petition shall be filed by the juvenile officer or the

38 division shall seek to be joined as a party to the petition, within sixty days of the judicial
39 determinations required in subsection 2 of this section, except as provided in subsection 4 of
40 this section. Failure to comply with this requirement shall not deprive the court of
41 jurisdiction to adjudicate a petition for termination of parental rights which is filed outside of
42 sixty days.
43 4. If grounds exist for termination of parental rights pursuant to subsection 2 of this
44 section, the juvenile officer or the division may, but is not required to, file a petition to
45 terminate the parental rights of the child's parent or parents if:
46 (1) The child is being cared for by a relative; or

48 not be in the best interest of the child, as documented in the permanency plan which shall be

50 (3) The family of the child has not been provided such services as provided for in
51 section 211.183.
HB 1933 3
52 5. The juvenile officer or the division may file a petition to terminate the parental
53 rights of the child's parent when it appears that one or more of the following grounds for
54 termination exist:
55 (1) The child has been abandoned. For purposes of this subdivision a "child" means
56 any child two years of age or older at the time of filing of the petition. The court shall find
57 that the child has been abandoned if, for a period of [six] three months or longer:
58 (a) Theparenthasleftthechildundersuchcircumstancesthattheidentityofthechild
59 was unknown and could not be ascertained, despite diligent searching, and the parent has not
60 come forward to claim the child; or
61 (b) The parent has, for a period of [six] three months immediately prior to the filing
62 of the petition for termination of parental rights, willfully, substantially, and continuously
63 neglected to provide the child with necessary care and protection;
64 (2) The child has been abused or neglected. In determining whether to terminate
65 parental rights pursuant to this subdivision, the court shall consider and make findings on the
66 following conditions or acts of the parent:
67 (a) A mentalconditionwhich isshown bycompetent evidenceeither to be permanent
68 or such that there is no reasonable likelihood that the condition can be reversed and which
69 renders the parent unable to knowingly provide the child the necessary care, custody and
70 control;
71 (b) Chemical dependency which prevents the parent from consistently providing the
72 necessary care, custody and control of the child and which cannot be treated so as to enable
73 the parent to consistently provide such care, custody and control;
74 (c) A severe act or recurrent acts of physical, emotional or sexual abuse toward the
75 child or any child in the family by the parent, including an act of incest, or by another under
76 circumstances that indicate that the parent knew or should have known that such acts were
77 being committed toward the child or any child in the family; or
78 (d) Repeated or continuous failure by the parent, although physically or financially
79 able,toprovidethechildwithadequatefood,clothing,shelter,oreducationasdefinedbylaw,
80 or other care and control necessary for the child's physical, mental, or emotional health and
81 development.
82
83 Nothing in this subdivision shall be construed to permit discrimination on the basis of
84 disability or disease;
85 (3) The child has been under the jurisdiction of the juvenile court for a period of one
86 year, and the court finds that the conditions which led to the assumption of jurisdiction still
87 persist, or conditions of a potentially harmful nature continue to exist, that there is little
88 likelihood that those conditions will be remedied at an early date so that the child can be
HB 1933 4
89 returned to the parent in the near future, or the continuation of the parent-child relationship
90 greatly diminishes the child's prospects for early integration into a stable and permanent
91 home. In determining whether to terminate parental rights under this subdivision, the court
92 shall consider and make findings on the following:
93 (a) The terms of a social service plan entered into by the parent and the division and
94 the extent to which the parties have made progress in complying with those terms;
95 (b) The success or failure of the efforts of the juvenile officer, the division or other
96 agency to aid the parent on a continuing basis in adjusting his circumstances or conduct to
97 provide a proper home for the child;
98 (c) A mentalconditionwhich isshown bycompetent evidenceeither to be permanent
99 or such that there is no reasonable likelihood that the condition can be reversed and which
100 renders the parent unable to knowingly provide the child the necessary care, custody and
101 control;
102 (d) Chemical dependency which prevents the parent from consistently providing the
103 necessarycare,custodyandcontrol overthechildandwhichcannotbe treatedsoasto enable
104 the parent to consistently provide such care, custody and control; or
105 (4) The child was conceived and born as a result of an act of forcible rape or rape in
106 the first degree. When the biological father has pled guilty to, or is convicted of, the forcible
107 rape or rape in the first degree of the birth mother, such a plea or conviction shall be
108 conclusive evidence supporting the termination of the biological father's parental rights; or
109 (5) (a) Theparent isunfitto bea partyto theparent andchildrelationshipbecause of
110 a consistent pattern of committing a specific abuse including, but not limited to, specific
111 conditions directly relating to the parent and child relationship which are determined by the
112 court to be of a duration or nature that renders the parent unable for the reasonably
113 foreseeable future to care appropriately for the ongoing physical, mental, or emotional needs
114 of the child.
115 (b) It is presumed that a parent is unfit to be a party to the parent and child
116 relationship upon a showing that:
117 a. Within a three-year period immediately prior to the termination adjudication, the
118 parent's parental rights to one or more other children were involuntarily terminated pursuant
119 to subsection 2 or 4 of this section or subdivision (1), (2), or (3) of this subsection or similar
120 laws of other states;
121 b. If the parent is the birth mother and within eight hours after the child's birth, the
122 child's birth mother tested positive and over eight-hundredths of one percent blood alcohol
123 content pursuant to testing under section 577.020 for alcohol, or tested positive for cocaine,
124 heroin, methamphetamine, a controlled substance as defined in section 195.010, or a
125 prescription drug as defined in section 196.973, excepting those controlled substances or
HB 1933 5
126 prescription drugs present in the mother's body as a result of medical treatment administered
127 to the mother, and the birth mother is the biological mother of at least one other child who
128 was adjudicated an abused or neglected minor by the mother or the mother has previously
129 failed to complete recommended treatment services by the children's division through a
130 family-centered services case;
131 c. If the parent is the birth mother and at the time of the child's birth or within eight
132 hours after a child's birth the child tested positive for alcohol, cocaine, heroin,
133 methamphetamine, a controlled substance as defined in section 195.010, or a prescription
134 drug as defined in section 196.973, excepting those controlled substances or prescription
135 drugspresentinthemother'sbodyasaresultofmedicaltreatmentadministeredtothemother,
136 and the birth mother is the biological mother of at least one other child who was adjudicated
137 an abused or neglected minor by the mother or the mother has previously failed to complete
138 recommendedtreatmentservicesbythechildren'sdivisionthroughafamily-centeredservices
139 case;
140 d. Within a three-year period immediately prior to the termination adjudication, the
141 parent has pled guilty to or has been convicted of a felony involving the possession,
142 distribution, or manufacture of cocaine, heroin, or methamphetamine, and the parent is the
143 biological parent of at least one other child who was adjudicated an abused or neglected
144 minor by such parent or such parent has previously failed to complete recommended
145 treatment services by the children's division through a family-centered services case; or
146 e. For at least fifteen of the twenty-two months prior to the filing of the petition, the
147 child has been in foster care under the jurisdiction of the juvenile court.
148 6. The juvenile court may terminate the rights of a parent to a child upon a petition
149 filed by the juvenile officer or the division, or in adoption cases, by a prospective parent, if
150 the court finds that the termination is in the best interest of the child and when it appears by
151 clear, cogent and convincing evidence that grounds exist for termination pursuant to
152 subsection 2, 4 or 5 of this section.
153 7. When considering whether to terminate the parent-child relationship pursuant to
154 subsection 2 or 4 of this section or subdivision (1), (2), or (3) of subsection 5 of this section,
155 the court shall evaluate and make findings on the following factors, when appropriate and
156 applicable to the case:
157 (1) The emotional ties to the birth parent;
158 (2) The extent to which the parent has maintained regular visitation or other contact
159 with the child;
160 (3) The extent of payment by the parent for the cost of care and maintenance of the
161 child when financially able to do so including the time that the child is in the custody of the
162 division or other child-placing agency;
HB 1933 6
163 (4) Whether additional services would be likely to bring about lasting parental
164 adjustment enabling a return of the child to the parent within an ascertainable period of time;
165 (5) The parent's disinterest in or lack of commitment to the child;
166 (6) The conviction of the parent of a felony offense that the court finds is of such a
167 nature that the child will be deprived of a stable home for a period of years; provided,
168 however, that incarceration in and of itself shall not be grounds for termination of parental
169 rights;
170 (7) Deliberateactsoftheparentoractsofanotherofwhichtheparentkneworshould
171 have known that subjects the child to a substantial risk of physical or mental harm.
172 8. The court may attach little or no weight to infrequent visitations, communications,
173 or contributions. It is irrelevant in a termination proceeding that the maintenance of the
174 parent-child relationship may serve as an inducement for the parent's rehabilitation.
175 9. In actions for adoption pursuant to chapter 453, the court may hear and determine
176 the issues raised in a petition for adoption containing a prayer for termination of parental
177 rightsfiledwiththesameeffectasapetitionpermittedpursuanttosubsection2,4,or5ofthis
178 section.
179 10. Thedisabilityordiseaseofaparentshallnotconstituteabasisforadetermination
180 that a child is a child in need of care, for the removal of custody of a child from the parent, or
181 for the termination of parental rights without a specific showing that there is a causal relation
182 between the disability or disease and harm to the child.
183 11. Acourtofcompetentjurisdictionmayterminatetheparentalrightsofa biological
184 father of a child if he is an alleged perpetrator of forcible rape under section 566.030 as it
185 existed prior to August 28, 2013, or rape in the first degree under section 566.030 that
186 resulted in the conception and birth of the child. The biological mother who is the victim of
187 the forcible rape or rape in the first degree or, if she is a minor, someone on her behalf may
188 file a petition to terminate the parental rights of the biological father. The court may
189 terminate the parental rights of the biological father if the court finds that by:
190 (1) Clear, cogent, and convincing evidence the biological father committed the act of
191 forcible rape or rape in the first degree against the biological mother;
192 (2) Clear, cogent, and convincing evidence the child was conceived as a result of that
193 act of forcible rape or rape in the first degree; and
194 (3) The preponderance of the evidence the termination of the parental rights of the
195 biological father is in the best interests of the child.
196 12. In any action to terminate the parental rights of the biological father under
197 subsection 11 of this section or subdivision (5) of subsection 5 of this section, a court of
198 competent jurisdiction may order that the mother and the child conceived and born as a result
199 of forcible rape or rape in the first degree are entitled to obtain from the biological father
HB 1933 7
200 certain payments, support, beneficiary designations, or other financial benefits. The court
201 shall issue such order only if the mother gives her consent; provided, that the court shall first
202 inform the mother that such order may require or obligate the mother to have continuous or
203 future communication and contact with the biological father. Such order shall be issued
204 without the biological father being entitled to or granted any custody, guardianship, visitation
205 privileges, or other parent-child relationship, and may include any or all of the following:
206 (1) Payment for the reasonableexpensesofthe mother orthe child,orboth, relatedto
207 pregnancy, labor, delivery, postpartum care, newborn care, or early childhood care;
208 (2) Child support under this chapter or chapter 210, 452, or 454;
209 (3) All rights of the child to inherit under the probate code, as defined in section
210 472.010; provided that, for purposes of intestate succession, the biological father or his
211 kindred shall have no right to inherit from or through the child;
212 (4) The designation of the child as the beneficiary of a life or accidental death
213 insurance policy, annuity, contract, plan, or other product sold or issued by a life insurance
214 company; or
215 (5) Any other payments, support, beneficiary designations, or financial benefits that
216 are in the best interests of the child or for the reasonable expenses of the mother, or both.
217
218 If the mother declines to seek a court order for child support under this subsection, no state
219 agency shall require the mother to do so in order to receive public assistance benefits for
220 herself or the child, including, but not limited to, benefits for temporary assistance for needy
221 families, supplemental nutrition assistance program, or MO HealthNet. The court order

225 mother or the child to otherwise provide the identity, location, income, or assets of the
226 biological father or have contact or communicate with the biological father. However,
227 nothing in this subsection shall prohibit a state agency from requesting that the mother assign

45 written consent shall be executed in front of a judge or acknowledged before a notary public.
46 If consent is executed in front of a judge, it shall be the duty of the judge to advise the
47 consenting party of the consequences of the consent. In lieu of acknowledgment before a
48 notary public, the signature of the person giving such written consent shall be witnessed by

64 August 28, 1997, but prior to the development of a consent form by the department and the
65 written consent complies with the provisions of subsection 8 of this section, such written
66 consent shall be deemed valid.

68 (1) The birth parent understands the importance of identifying all possible fathers of
69 the child and may provide the names of all such persons; and
70 (2) The birth parent understands that if he denies paternity, but consents to the
