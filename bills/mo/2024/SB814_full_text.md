sections relating to assessment of public elementary and secondary schools.
Be it enacted by the General Assembly of the State of Missouri, as follows:
1 Section A. Sections 160.518, 160.522, and 161.092, RSMo,
2 are repealed and three new sections enacted in lieu thereof, to
3 be known as sections 160.518, 160.522, and 161.092, to read as
4 follows:
1 160.518. 1. Sections 160.518, 160.522, and 161.092
2 shall be known and may be cited as the "Education Freedom
3 Act".
4 2. Consistent with the provisions contained in section
5 160.526, the state board of education shall develop, modify,
6 and revise, as necessary, a statewide summative assessment
7 system that [provides maximum flexibility for local school
8 districts to determine the degree to which students in the
9 public schools of the state are proficient in the knowledge,
10 skills, and competencies adopted by such board pursuant to
11 section 160.514. The statewide assessment system shall
12 assess problem solving, analytical ability, evaluation,
13 creativity, and application ability in the different content
14 areas and shall be performance-based to identify what
15 students know, as well as what they are able to do, and
16 shall enable teachers to evaluate actual academic
17 performance. The statewide assessment system shall neither
EXPLANATION-Matter enclosed in bold-faced brackets [thus] in this bill is not enacted
and is intended to be omitted in the law.
SB 814 2
18 promote nor prohibit rote memorization and shall not include
19 existing versions of tests approved for use pursuant to the
20 provisions of section 160.257, nor enhanced versions of such
21 tests. After the state board of education adopts and
22 implements academic performance standards as required under
23 section 161.855, the state board of education shall develop
24 and adopt a standardized assessment instrument under this
25 section based on the academic performance standards adopted
26 under section 161.855. The statewide assessment system
27 shall measure, where appropriate by grade level, a student's
28 knowledge of academic subjects including, but not limited
29 to, reading skills, writing skills, mathematics skills,
30 world and American history, forms of government, geography
31 and science] satisfies the pupil testing mandates in effect
32 under the federal Every Student Succeeds Act (P.L. 114-95),
33 as amended, for each school year. Results from the
34 assessment created under this subsection shall be used only
35 for the purpose of compliance with the requirements of such
36 federal law and for no other purpose except for determining
37 performance districts under sections 163.011 and 163.031.
38 Results from such assessments shall not be used to classify
39 school districts and charter schools.
40 [2. The statewide assessment system shall only permit
41 the academic performance of students in each school in the
42 state to be tracked against prior academic performance in
43 the same school.
44 3. The state board of education shall suggest, but not
45 mandate, criteria for a school to demonstrate that its
46 students learn the knowledge, skills and competencies at
47 exemplary levels worthy of imitation by students in other
48 schools in the state and nation. Exemplary levels shall be
49 measured by the statewide assessment system developed
SB 814 3
50 pursuant to subsection 1 of this section, or until said
51 statewide assessment system is available, by indicators
52 approved for such use by the state board of education. The
53 provisions of other law to the contrary notwithstanding, the
54 commissioner of education may, upon request of the school
55 district, present a plan for the waiver of rules and
56 regulations to any such school, to be known as "Outstanding
57 Schools Waivers", consistent with the provisions of
58 subsection 4 of this section.
59 4. For any school that meets the criteria established
60 by the state board of education for three successive school
61 years pursuant to the provisions of subsection 3 of this
62 section, by August first following the third such school
63 year, the commissioner of education shall present a plan to
64 the superintendent of the school district in which such
65 school is located for the waiver of rules and regulations to
66 promote flexibility in the operations of the school and to
67 enhance and encourage efficiency in the delivery of
68 instructional services. The provisions of other law to the
69 contrary notwithstanding, the plan presented to the
70 superintendent shall provide a summary waiver, with no
71 conditions, for the pupil testing requirements pursuant to
72 section 160.257, in the school. Further, the provisions of
73 other law to the contrary notwithstanding, the plan shall
74 detail a means for the waiver of requirements otherwise
75 imposed on the school related to the authority of the state
76 board of education to classify school districts pursuant to
77 subdivision (9) of section 161.092 and such other rules and
78 regulations as determined by the commissioner of education,
79 excepting such waivers shall be confined to the school and
80 not other schools in the district unless such other schools
81 meet the criteria established by the state board of
SB 814 4
82 education consistent with subsection 3 of this section and
83 the waivers shall not include the requirements contained in
84 this section and section 160.514. Any waiver provided to
85 any school as outlined in this subsection shall be void on
86 June thirtieth of any school year in which the school fails
87 to meet the criteria established by the state board of
88 education consistent with subsection 3 of this section.
89 5. The score on any assessment test developed pursuant
90 to this section or this chapter of any student for whom
91 English is a second language shall not be counted until such
92 time as such student has been educated for three full school
93 years in a school in this state, or in any other state, in
94 which English is the primary language.]
95 3. School districts and charter schools shall create,
96 purchase, or adopt an interim assessment system that
97 measures students' knowledge at the beginning of each school
98 year and measures academic growth throughout the same school
99 year.
100 4. The interim assessment system shall be:
101 (1) Authentic to student discipline-specific learning,
102 experience, and the demonstration of performance-based
103 learning;
104 (2) Related to curriculum taught in the school;
105 (3) Evaluated and graded in a manner that provides
106 students and teachers with meaningful feedback that can be
107 used for academic improvement;
108 (4) Developed in consultation with building level
109 administrators, teachers, students, parents, and the
110 community; and
111 (5) Available for demonstration and community
112 inspection.
SB 814 5
113 [6.] 5. The state board of education shall identify
114 or, if necessary, establish one or more developmentally
115 appropriate alternate assessments for students who receive
116 special educational services, as that term is defined
117 pursuant to section 162.675. In the development of such
118 alternate assessments, the state board shall establish an
119 advisory panel consisting of a majority of active special
120 education teachers residing in Missouri and other education
121 professionals as appropriate to research available
122 assessment options. The advisory panel shall attempt to
123 identify preexisting developmentally appropriate alternate
124 assessments but shall, if necessary, develop alternate
125 assessments and recommend one or more alternate assessments
126 for adoption by the state board. The state board shall
127 consider the recommendations of the advisory council in
128 establishing such alternate assessment or assessments. Any
129 student who receives special educational services, as that
130 term is defined pursuant to section 162.675, shall be
131 assessed by an alternate assessment established pursuant to
132 this subsection upon a determination by the student's
133 individualized education program team that such alternate
134 assessment is more appropriate to assess the student's
135 knowledge, skills and competencies than the assessment
136 developed pursuant to subsection 1 of this section. The
137 alternate assessment shall evaluate the student's
138 independent living skills, which include how effectively the
139 student addresses common life demands and how well the
140 student meets standards for personal independence expected
141 for someone in the student's age group, sociocultural
142 background, and community setting.
143 [7.] 6. The state board of education shall also
144 develop recommendations regarding alternate assessments for
SB 814 6
145 any military dependent who relocates to Missouri after the
146 commencement of a school term, in order to accommodate such
147 student while ensuring that he or she is proficient in the
148 knowledge, skills, and competencies adopted under section
149 160.514.

2 secondary education shall produce or cause to be produced,
3 at least annually, a school accountability report card for
4 each public school district, each public school building in
5 a school district, and each charter school in the state.
6 The report card shall be designed to satisfy state and
7 federal requirements for the disclosure of statistics about
8 students, staff, finances, academic achievement, and other
9 indicators. The purpose of the report card shall be to
10 provide educational statistics and accountability
11 information for parents, taxpayers, school personnel,
12 legislators, and the print and broadcast news media in a
13 standardized, easily accessible form] School districts and
14 charter schools shall provide public reporting of
15 information on an annual basis as provided in this section.

21 education shall develop a standard form for the school
22 accountability report card.] The information reported shall
23 include, but not be limited to, the district's [most recent]

50 currently being served in the district's or charter school's
51 state-approved gifted education program.

71 substantive official communications such as student report
72 cards. The school district or charter school shall provide
73 a printed copy of the district-level or school-level report
74 card to any patron upon request and shall make reasonable
75 efforts to supply businesses such as, but not limited to,
76 real estate and employment firms with copies or other
77 information about the reports so that parents and businesses
78 from outside the district who may be contemplating
79 relocation have access.
