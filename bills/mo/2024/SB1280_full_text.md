SB 1280 2
15 from the time of the commissioner's appointment and
16 qualification and until his successor shall qualify.
17 Vacancies in the commission shall be filled by the governor
18 for the unexpired term.
1 386.480. 1. No information furnished to the
2 commission by a corporation, person or public utility,
3 except such matters as are specifically required to be open
4 to public inspection by the provisions of this chapter, or
5 chapter 610, shall be open to public inspection or made
6 public except on order of the commission, or by the
7 commission or a commissioner in the course of a hearing or
8 proceeding. The public counsel shall have full and complete
9 access to public service commission files and records. Any
10 officer or employee of the commission or the public counsel
11 or any employee of the public counsel who, in violation of
12 the provisions of this section, divulges any such
13 information shall be guilty of a misdemeanor.
14 2. Any party to a proceeding before the commission may
15 request the commission adopt protections more restrictive
16 than afforded by the commission's rules that otherwise
17 govern the protection of certain information with such
18 restrictions to apply to information, the disclosure of
19 which could cause undue risk to critical infrastructure
20 including, but not limited to, the bulk power system or
21 other critical facilities, and cybersecurity measures.
22 These protections may include the requirement that parties
23 view the materials either on-site at the producing party's
24 location or through an online portal without taking copies
25 of the material. The restrictions may also include a
26 limitation that only commission staff and the office of the
27 public counsel be granted access to the materials. The
28 commission shall grant a party's request when necessary to
SB 1280 3
29 comply with federal law or regulation. If federal law or
30 regulation does not require protection of the information,
31 the commission shall employ the following balancing test to
32 determine whether protection from disclosure is warranted:
33 (1) Whether disclosure will significantly aid the
34 commission in fulfilling its functions;
35 (2) The harm or benefit which disclosure will cause to
36 the public interest;
37 (3) The harm which disclosure will cause the public
38 utility; and
39 (4) Alternatives to disclosure that will serve the
40 public interest and protect the public utility.
1 386.510. 1. With respect to commission orders or
2 decisions issued on and after July 1, 2011, within thirty
3 days after the application for a rehearing is denied, or, if
4 the application is granted, then within thirty days after
5 the rendition of the decision on rehearing, the applicant
6 may file a notice of appeal with the appellate court with
7 the territorial jurisdiction over the county where the
8 hearing was held or in which the commission has its
9 principal office for the purpose of having the
10 reasonableness or lawfulness of the original order or
11 decision or the order or decision on rehearing inquired into
12 or determined, which shall also be served on the commission
13 and the parties to the commission proceeding in accordance
14 with section 386.515; provided, however, that the public
15 counsel shall not be permitted to file a notice of appeal
16 unless expressly authorized in writing to do so by the
17 director of the department to which the office of the public
18 counsel reports in accordance with the terms of subsection 2
19 of this section. Except with respect to a stay or
20 suspension pursuant to subsection 1 of section 386.520, no
SB 1280 4
21 new or additional evidence may be introduced in the
22 appellate court but the cause shall be heard by the court
23 without the intervention of a jury on the evidence and
24 exhibits introduced before the commission and certified to
25 by it. The notice of appeal shall include the appellant's
26 application for rehearing, a copy of the reconciliation
27 required by subsection 4 of section 386.420, a concise
28 statement of the issues being appealed, a full and complete
29 list of the parties to the commission proceeding, all
30 necessary filing fees, and any other information specified
31 by the rules of the court. Unless otherwise ordered by the
32 court of appeals, the commission shall, within thirty days
33 of the filing of the notice of appeal, certify its record in
34 the case to the court of appeals. The commission and each
35 party to the action or proceeding before the commission
36 shall have the right to intervene and participate fully in
37 the review proceedings; provided, however, that the public
38 counsel shall not be permitted to participate in any appeal
39 unless expressly authorized in writing to do so by the
40 director of the department to which the office of the public
41 counsel reports in accordance with the terms of subsection 2
42 of this section. Upon the submission of the case to the
43 court of appeals, the court of appeals shall render its
44 opinion either affirming or setting aside, in whole or in
45 part, the order or decision of the commission under review.
46 In case the order or decision is reversed by reason of the
47 commission failing to receive testimony properly proffered,
48 the court shall remand the cause to the commission, with
49 instructions to receive the testimony so proffered and
50 rejected, and enter a new order or render a new decision
51 based upon the evidence theretofore taken, and such as it is
52 directed to receive. The court may, in its discretion,
SB 1280 5
53 remand any cause which is reversed by it to the commission
54 for further action. No court in this state, except the
55 supreme court or the court of appeals, shall have
56 jurisdiction or authority to review, reverse, correct or
57 annul any order or decision of the commission or to suspend
58 or delay the executing or operation thereof, or to enjoin,
59 restrain or interfere with the commission in the performance
60 of its official duties. The appellate courts of this state
61 shall always be deemed open for the trial of suits brought
62 to review the orders and decisions of the commission as
63 provided in the public service commission law and the same
64 shall where necessary be tried and determined as suits in
65 equity.
66 2. Any notice of appeal by public counsel or request
67 by public counsel to participate in any appeal shall be
68 accompanied by a communication in writing signed by the
69 department director of the department to which the office of
70 the public counsel reports granting the public counsel
71 authorization to file the subject notice of appeal or
72 request to participate, and certifying that such appeal or
73 participation by the public counsel is reasonably likely to
74 be successful on the merits, unlikely to result in higher
75 utility service costs for the public in the future, and is a
76 good and efficient use of scarce government resources. If
77 no such written communication accompanies any notice of
78 appeal by public counsel or any request by public counsel to
79 participate in any appeal, the court shall reject the public
80 counsel's notice of appeal or deny public counsel's request
81 to participate.
1 386.700. The [director of the department of economic
2 development shall appoint a public counsel to serve at the
3 pleasure of the director of the department] governor shall
SB 1280 6
4 appoint a public counsel, with the advice and consent of the
5 senate. The public counsel shall be an attorney at law
6 licensed to practice law in this state and whose salary
7 shall be fixed by the [department] director of the
8 department to which the office of the public counsel reports
9 within the appropriation made therefor.
1 386.710. 1. The public counsel shall have the
2 following powers and duties:
3 (1) He shall employ a staff or hire on a contract
4 basis such employees and experts as are necessary to carry
5 out the purposes and responsibilities of his office, and
6 shall set their compensation within the appropriation made
7 for that purpose;
8 (2) He may represent and protect the interests of the
9 public in any proceeding before or appeal from the public
10 service commission;
11 (3) He shall have discretion to represent or refrain
12 from representing the public in any proceeding. He shall
13 consider in exercising his discretion the importance and the
14 extent of the public interest involved and whether that
15 interest would be adequately represented without the action
16 of his office. If the public counsel determines that there
17 are conflicting public interests involved in a particular
18 matter, he may choose to represent one such interest based
19 upon the considerations of this section, to represent no
20 interest in that matter, or to represent one interest and
21 certify to the director of the department of economic
22 development that there is a significant public interest
23 which he cannot represent without creating a conflict of
24 interest and which will not be protected by any party to the
25 proceeding. The director of the department shall select an
26 attorney, to be paid from funds appropriated for this
SB 1280 7
27 purpose, to represent that segment of the public certified
28 to him by the public counsel as unrepresented. Nothing in
29 this section shall be construed to limit the right of any
30 person, firm or corporation specified in subsection 1 of
31 section 386.390 to petition or make complaint to the
32 commission or otherwise intervene in proceedings or other
33 matters before the commission.
34 2. In representing the interests of the public, the
35 public counsel shall balance:
36 (1) The costs and rate impacts to all classes of
37 current and future public utility customers;
38 (2) Promoting safe, resilient, and reliable public
39 utility service;
40 (3) Ensuring the public utility has access to capital
41 upon reasonable cost and terms; and
42 (4) Promoting economic development and job creation
43 within the state.
44 3. The public counsel shall be served with all
45 proposed tariffs, initial pleadings, and applications, in
46 all proceedings before the public service commission, and
47 shall be served with a copy of all orders of the commission.
48 [3. Nothing in sections 386.071, 386.150, 386.155,
49 386.170, 386.200, 386.330, 386.360, 386.390, 386.400,
50 386.410, 386.420, 386.440, 386.450, 386.480, 386.500,
51 386.530, 386.540, 386.600, 386.700 and 386.710, shall be
52 construed or interpreted to mean that the public counsel
53 shall not have the right to appeal any and all orders of the
54 public service commission to the courts which right of
55 appeal exists and has existed since the time of transfer as
56 provided in section 386.500.]
57 4. [He] The public counsel shall have all powers
58 necessary or proper to carry out the duties specified in
SB 1280 8
59 this section, but the public counsel shall not have the
60 power to initiate or participate in any appeal of any
61 decision or order of the commission, without obtaining
62 express authorization for such from the director of the
63 department to which the office of the public counsel reports
64 as provided in section 386.510.
1 393.150. 1. Whenever there shall be filed with the
2 commission by any gas corporation, electrical corporation,
3 water corporation or sewer corporation any schedule stating
4 a new rate or charge, or any new form of contract or
5 agreement, or any new rule, regulation or practice relating
6 to any rate, charge or service or to any general privilege
7 or facility, the commission shall have, and it is hereby
8 given, authority, either upon complaint or upon its own
9 initiative without complaint, at once, and if it so orders
10 without answer or other formal pleading by the interested
11 gas corporation, electrical corporation, water corporation
12 or sewer corporation, but upon reasonable notice, to enter
13 upon a hearing concerning the propriety of such rate,
14 charge, form of contract or agreement, rule, regulation or
15 practice, and pending such hearing and the decision thereon,
16 the commission upon filing with such schedule, and
17 delivering to the gas corporation, electrical corporation,
18 water corporation or sewer corporation affected thereby, a
19 statement in writing of its reasons for such suspension, may
20 suspend the operation of such schedule and defer the use of
21 such rate, charge, form of contract or agreement, rule,
22 regulation or practice, but not for a longer period than one
23 hundred and twenty days beyond the time when such rate,
24 charge, form of contract or agreement, rule, regulation or
25 practice would otherwise go into effect; and after full
26 hearing, whether completed before or after the rate, charge,
SB 1280 9
27 form of contract or agreement, rule, regulation or practice
28 goes into effect, the commission may make such order in
29 reference to such rate, charge, form of contract or
30 agreement, rule, regulation or practice as would be proper
31 in a proceeding initiated after the rate, charge, form of
32 contract or agreement, rule, regulation or practice had
33 become effective.
34 2. If any such hearing cannot be concluded within the
35 period of suspension, as above stated, the commission may,
36 in its discretion, extend the time of suspension for a
37 further period not exceeding six months. At any hearing
38 involving a rate sought to be increased, the burden of proof
39 to show that the increased rate or proposed increased rate
40 is just and reasonable shall be upon the gas corporation,
41 electrical corporation, water corporation or sewer
42 corporation, and the commission shall give to the hearing
43 and decision of such questions preference over all other
44 questions pending before it and decide the same as speedily
45 as possible.
46 3. (1) The test year for proceedings under this
47 section shall be a future year utilizing a twelve-month
48 period ending no later than twenty-four months after the
49 filing of schedules stating new base rates. New base rates
50 shall not go into effect before the first day of the future
51 test year. For purposes of establishing the revenue
52 requirement for the future test year, the commission shall
53 utilize a thirteen-month average projected rate base, a
54 thirteen-month average of the public utility's projected
55 capital structure, a thirteen-month average of the public
56 utility's projected cost of debt, projected revenues, and
57 projected expenses. The thirteen-month average will be
58 calculated using the projected month-end balances from the
SB 1280 10
59 month new base rates are projected to be effective, and the
60 next twelve consecutive projected month-end balances.
61 (2) Notwithstanding the provisions of subdivision (1)
62 of this subsection, for a public utility that is also an
63 electrical corporation, the commission shall not utilize a
64 projected rate base but shall instead utilize the actual
65 rate base for all rate base components as of the end of a
66 historical test year with a true-up, except that for
67 inventory, customer advances and deposits, and prepayments a
68 thirteen-month average ending as of the true-up cutoff date
69 shall be used. An electrical corporation may estimate the
70 rate base as of the true-up cutoff date at the time it files
71 its application. All other revenue requirement items shall
72 be projected as provided for in subdivision (1) of this
73 subsection. The true-up period selected by the electrical
74 corporation shall be used to set base rates in proceedings
75 under this section.
76 (3) With respect to public utilities that are not also
77 an electrical corporation, within sixty days of the end of
78 the future test year, such public utility shall update its
79 base rates that were approved by the commission in its
80 report and order issued in the proceeding under this section
81 to reflect the total rate base at the end of the future test
82 year.
83 (4) The test year selected by the public utility shall
84 be used for setting base rates in proceedings under this
85 section. The public counsel, the staff of the commission,
86 and intervenors in the case may propose adjustments or other
87 changes to the revenue requirement of the test year selected
88 by the public utility but shall not present alternative base
89 rates based on a test year different from that selected by
90 the public utility.
SB 1280 11
91 4. In any proceeding under this section, the
92 commission shall evaluate such public utility on a stand-
93 alone basis and, for purposes of establishing revenue
94 requirement, utilize such public utility's test year capital
95 structure, without regard to the capital structure or
96 investments of any other entities with which such public
97 utility may be affiliated, unless the commission finds based
98 on evidence in the record that the public utility's capital
99 structure is imprudent. The capital structure shall include
100 the relative proportions of common equity, long-term debt,
101 and preferred stock consistent with the public utility's
102 test year.
103 5. For purposes of this section, the following terms
104 mean:
105 (1) "Base rates", rates or charges for public utility

31 are projected to be effective, and the next twelve
32 consecutive projected month-end balances.
33 (2) Notwithstanding the provisions of subdivision (1)
34 of this subsection, for a public utility that is also an

36 projected rate base but shall instead utilize actual rate
37 base for all rate base components as of the end of a
38 historical test year with a true-up, except that for
39 inventory, customer advances and deposits, and prepayments a
40 thirteen-month average ending as of the true-up cutoff date

45 "true-up cutoff date" as hereinafter defined as compared to
SB 1280 16
46 the last day of the test year utilized by the electrical
47 corporation when the case was initiated. An electrical
48 corporation may estimate the rate base as of the true-up
49 cutoff date at the time it files its application. The "true-
50 up cutoff date" shall be a date selected by the electrical

1 393.1825. 1. A public utility that is also an
2 electrical corporation, gas corporation, or heating company
3 may elect to base its return on equity on the fully-
4 litigated case twelve-month average from the most recent
5 report issued in the Regulatory Research Associates
6 Regulatory Focus publication, or its successor publication,
7 for the applicable utility type, in lieu of using a
8 projected return on equity. In the case of electrical
9 corporations, fully-litigated observations from cases for
10 electric utilities in restructured jurisdictions or special
11 rider or non-base rate cases in other jurisdictions shall be
12 excluded from the average. If the utility elects to use
13 such return on equity, such election shall be conclusive and
14 binding on the commission for purposes of determining
SB 1280 24
15 revenue requirement and, except for purposes consistent with
16 the last sentence of this subsection, no other evidence of
17 return on equity shall be admitted. The commission may
18 establish, in a case order or by other order, operational
19 metrics for utilities which, if achieved, may result in an
20 adjustment of up to twenty-five basis points above or below
21 the Regulatory Research Associates Regulatory Focus
22 publication, or its successor publication, fully-litigated
23 case average return on equity determined as specified above,
24 where dictated by customer service, operations, changing
25 economic or market conditions, or other relevant factors.
26 2. The commission shall consider all admissible
27 evidence on return on equity and select a reasonable return
28 on equity for a public utility that chooses not to or cannot
29 elect the return on equity treatment in subsection 1 of this
30 section.
1 393.1830. 1. It is the public policy of sections
2 393.1800 to 393.1835 to favor and promote settlement of
3 cases conducted under sections 393.1800 to 393.1835. Any
4 statute, rule or judicial application or interpretation
5 thereof, including but not limited to Missouri state
6 appellate opinions in State ex rel. Fischer v. Public
7 Service Commission of the State of Missouri, reported at 545
8 S.W.2d 39 and State ex rel. Rice v. Public Service
9 Commission, reported at 220 S.W.3d 61, and any appellate
10 decisions relying on the same, that are inconsistent with
11 this policy, are hereby abrogated. With respect to
12 settlement agreements in base rate cases under sections
13 393.1800 to 393.1835, this section prescribes the only
14 process that is due to a nonsettling party.
15 2. Settlement agreements reached between the public
16 utility filing a base rate proceeding under sections
SB 1280 25
17 393.1800 to 393.1835 and the commission staff shall be
18 presumed to be reasonable. The commission shall approve
19 settlement agreements reached between the public utility and
20 the commission staff and issue a final order setting the
21 utility's revenue requirement on the terms specified in the
22 settlement agreement absent a finding by the commission,
23 based on competent and substantial evidence after hearing on
24 the sole question of whether the settlement agreement's
25 terms are reasonable, that the proposed settlement is
26 contrary to the public interest.
1 393.1835. The provisions of sections 393.1800 to
2 393.1835 are severable. If any provision of sections
3 393.1800 to 393.1835 is found to be unconstitutional, the
4 remaining provisions are valid. The provisions of this
5 section shall be operative notwithstanding section 1.140.
