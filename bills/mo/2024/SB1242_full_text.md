Be it enacted by the General Assembly of the State of Missouri, as follows:
1 Section A. Sections 99.805, 99.810, and 99.845, RSMo, are
2 repealed and seven new sections enacted in lieu thereof, to be
3 known as sections 99.805, 99.810, 99.811, 99.812, 99.813,
4 99.814, and 99.845, to read as follows:
1 99.805. As used in sections 99.800 to 99.865, unless
2 the context clearly requires otherwise, the following terms
3 shall mean:
4 (1) "Blighted area", an area in which[, by reason of
5 the predominance of insanitary or unsafe conditions,
6 deterioration of site improvements, or the existence of
7 conditions which endanger life or property by fire and other
8 causes, or any combination of such factors, retards the
9 provision of housing accommodations or constitutes an
10 economic or social liability or a menace to the public
11 health, safety, or welfare in its present condition and use]:
12 (a) The buildings in the area are insanitary or unsafe
13 for living or working or are substantially vacant, provided
14 that the area qualifies as a distressed community under
15 section 135.530;
EXPLANATION-Matter enclosed in bold-faced brackets [thus] in this bill is not enacted
and is intended to be omitted in the law.
SB 1242 2
16 (b) The level of unemployment is one and one-half
17 times greater than the average rate of unemployment for the
18 state, as averaged over the preceding twelve months; or
19 (c) The median household income is less than fifty
20 percent of the median household income of the metropolitan
21 statistical area in which the area is located, if any;

23 municipality responsible for receiving and processing
24 payments in lieu of taxes or economic activity taxes from
25 taxpayers or the department of revenue;
26 (3) "Conservation area", any improved area within the
27 boundaries of a redevelopment area located within the
28 territorial limits of a municipality in which fifty percent
29 or more of the structures in the area have an age of thirty-
30 five years or more. Such an area is not yet a blighted area
31 but is detrimental to the public health, safety, or welfare
32 and may become a blighted area because of any one or more of
33 the following factors: dilapidation; obsolescence;
34 deterioration; illegal use of individual structures;
35 presence of structures below minimum code standards;
36 abandonment; excessive vacancies; overcrowding of structures
37 and community facilities; lack of ventilation, light or
38 sanitary facilities; inadequate utilities; excessive land
39 coverage; deleterious land use or layout; depreciation of
40 physical maintenance; and lack of community planning. A
41 conservation area shall meet at least three of the factors
42 provided in this subdivision for projects approved on or
43 after December 23, 1997. For all redevelopment plans and
44 projects approved on or after January 1, 2022, in retail
45 areas, a conservation area shall meet the dilapidation
46 factor as one of the three factors required under this
47 subdivision;
SB 1242 3
48 (4) "Economic activity taxes", the total additional
49 revenue from taxes which are imposed by a municipality and

58 hotels and motels, licenses, fees or special assessments.
59 For redevelopment projects or redevelopment plans approved
60 after December 23, 1997, if a retail establishment relocates
61 within one year from one facility to another facility within
62 the same county and the governing body of the municipality
63 finds that the relocation is a direct beneficiary of tax
64 increment financing, then for purposes of this definition,
65 the economic activity taxes generated by the retail
66 establishment shall equal the total additional revenues from
67 economic activity taxes which are imposed by a municipality
68 or other taxing district over the amount of economic
69 activity taxes generated by the retail establishment in the
70 calendar year prior to its relocation to the redevelopment
71 area;

76 governing body of the municipality finds that redevelopment
77 will not be solely used for development of commercial
78 businesses which unfairly compete in the local economy and
79 is in the public interest because it will:
SB 1242 4
80 (a) Discourage commerce, industry or manufacturing
81 from moving their operations to another state; or

164 municipality not adopted tax increment allocation financing,
165 and which would result from levies made after the time of
166 the adoption of tax increment allocation financing during

79 (7) An economic feasibility analysis that includes a
80 financial statement indicating whether a return on
81 investment is expected without public assistance. The

85 private investors.
86 2. Tax increment allocation financing shall not be
87 adopted under sections 99.800 to 99.865 in a retail area
88 unless such financing is exclusively utilized to fund retail
89 infrastructure projects or unless such area is a blighted
90 area or conservation area. The provisions of this
91 subsection shall not apply to any tax increment allocation
SB 1242 13
92 financing project or plan approved before August 28, 2021,
93 nor to any amendment to tax increment allocation financing
94 projects and plans where such projects or plans were
95 originally approved before August 28, 2021, provided that
96 such an amendment does not add buildings of new construction
97 in excess of twenty-five percent of the scope of the
98 original redevelopment agreement.

5 seven years or less shall be exempt from the provisions of
6 section 99.866. However, no stringing of projects shall be
7 allowed. No exempt project under this section shall be
8 combined with another exempt project under this section for
9 a period of five years.
10 2. Any redevelopment project for which eligible
11 project redevelopment costs are to be paid with only revenue
12 from the portion of total economic activity taxes and
13 payments in lieu of taxes imposed by the municipality and

15 jurisdictions shall be exempt from the provisions of section
16 99.866.
SB 1242 14
1 99.812. Beginning the first fiscal year in which a
2 municipality receives payments in lieu of taxes from a
3 redevelopment project and ending the last fiscal year in
4 which the municipality receives such payments, the
5 municipality shall pay an amount equal to twenty-five
6 percent of such payments in lieu of taxes to all other
7 taxing entities that are entitled to receive revenue from
8 levies on real property in such municipality. Such amount
9 shall be distributed among the other taxing entities in
10 proportion to the collections of revenue from real property
11 in the development area to which each such taxing district
12 is entitled during that tax year. If a tax increment
13 financing project includes residential uses, real property
14 tax levies attributable to the residential portion of the
15 development shall be distributed to the local school
16 district or districts, absent the affected school board or
17 boards issuing a recommendation to the contrary.
1 99.813. 1. The municipality and the developer shall
2 annually submit information to the department of economic

8 under the authority delegated in this section shall become
9 effective only if it complies with and is subject to all of
10 the provisions of chapter 536 and, if applicable, section
11 536.028. This section and chapter 536 are nonseverable and
12 if any of the powers vested with the general assembly
13 pursuant to chapter 536 to review, to delay the effective
14 date, or to disapprove and annul a rule are subsequently
15 held unconstitutional, then the grant of rulemaking
SB 1242 15
16 authority and any rule proposed or adopted after August 28,
17 2024, shall be invalid and void.
18 3. The department shall submit a report to the
19 governor and the general assembly by April thirtieth of each
20 year. At a minimum, the report shall identify the number
21 and location of redevelopment areas; quantify public
22 investment in each redevelopment area; assess the public
23 benefit, as quantified by tax revenue and net new job
24 creation; and state the economic impact of each
25 redevelopment project on each taxing district at least
26 partially within the boundaries of the redevelopment
27 project's redevelopment area.
1 99.814. A redevelopment district providing emergency
2 services under chapter 190 or 321 shall be entitled to

3 municipality has undertaken acts establishing a
4 redevelopment plan and redevelopment project and has
5 designated a redevelopment area after the passage and
6 approval of sections 99.800 to 99.865 but prior to August
7 13, 1982, which acts are in conformance with the procedures
8 of sections 99.800 to 99.865, may adopt tax increment
9 allocation financing by passing an ordinance providing that
10 after the total equalized assessed valuation of the taxable
11 real property in a redevelopment project exceeds the
12 certified total initial equalized assessed valuation of the
SB 1242 17
13 taxable real property in the redevelopment project, the ad
14 valorem taxes, and payments in lieu of taxes, if any,
15 arising from the levies upon taxable real property in such
16 redevelopment project by taxing districts and tax rates
17 determined in the manner provided in subsection 2 of section

20 follows:
21 (1) That portion of taxes, penalties and interest
22 levied upon each taxable lot, block, tract, or parcel of
23 real property which is attributable to the initial equalized
24 assessed value of each such taxable lot, block, tract, or
25 parcel of real property in the area selected for the
26 redevelopment project shall be allocated to and, when
27 collected, shall be paid by the county collector to the
28 respective affected taxing districts in the manner required
29 by law in the absence of the adoption of tax increment
30 allocation financing;
31 (2) (a) Payments in lieu of taxes attributable to the
32 increase in the current equalized assessed valuation of each
33 taxable lot, block, tract, or parcel of real property in the
34 area selected for the redevelopment project and any
35 applicable penalty and interest over and above the initial
36 equalized assessed value of each such unit of property in
37 the area selected for the redevelopment project shall be
38 allocated to and, when collected, shall be paid to the
39 municipal treasurer who shall deposit such payment in lieu
40 of taxes into a special fund called the "Special Allocation
41 Fund" of the municipality for the purpose of paying
42 redevelopment costs and obligations incurred in the payment
43 thereof. Beginning August 28, 2014, if the voters in a
44 taxing district vote to approve an increase in such taxing
SB 1242 18
45 district's levy rate for ad valorem tax on real property,
46 any additional revenues generated within an existing
47 redevelopment project area that are directly attributable to
48 the newly voter-approved incremental increase in such taxing
49 district's levy rate shall not be considered payments in
50 lieu of taxes subject to deposit into a special allocation
51 fund without the consent of such taxing district. Revenues
52 will be considered directly attributable to the newly voter-
53 approved incremental increase to the extent that they are
54 generated from the difference between the taxing district's
55 actual levy rate currently imposed and the maximum voter-
56 approved levy rate at the time that the redevelopment
57 project was adopted. Payments in lieu of taxes which are
58 due and owing shall constitute a lien against the real
59 estate of the redevelopment project from which they are
60 derived and shall be collected in the same manner as the
61 real property tax, including the assessment of penalties and
62 interest where applicable. The municipality may, in the
63 ordinance, pledge the funds in the special allocation fund
64 for the payment of such costs and obligations and provide
65 for the collection of payments in lieu of taxes, the lien of
66 which may be foreclosed in the same manner as a special
67 assessment lien as provided in section 88.861. No part of
68 the current equalized assessed valuation of each lot, block,
69 tract, or parcel of property in the area selected for the
70 redevelopment project attributable to any increase above the
71 total initial equalized assessed value of such properties
72 shall be used in calculating the general state school aid
73 formula provided for in section 163.031 until such time as
74 all redevelopment costs have been paid as provided for in
75 this section and section 99.850.
SB 1242 19
76 (b) Notwithstanding any provisions of this section to
77 the contrary, for purposes of determining the limitation on
78 indebtedness of local government pursuant to Article VI,
79 Section 26(b) of the Missouri Constitution, the current
80 equalized assessed value of the property in an area selected
81 for redevelopment attributable to the increase above the
82 total initial equalized assessed valuation shall be included
83 in the value of taxable tangible property as shown on the
84 last completed assessment for state or county purposes.
85 (c) The county assessor shall include the current
86 assessed value of all property within the taxing district in
87 the aggregate valuation of assessed property entered upon
88 the assessor's book and verified pursuant to section
89 137.245, and such value shall be utilized for the purpose of
90 the debt limitation on local government pursuant to Article
91 VI, Section 26(b) of the Missouri Constitution;
92 (3) For purposes of this section, "levies upon taxable
93 real property in such redevelopment project by taxing
94 districts" shall not include the blind pension fund tax
95 levied under the authority of Article III, Section 38(b) of
96 the Missouri Constitution, or the merchants' and
97 manufacturers' inventory replacement tax levied under the
98 authority of subsection 2 of Section 6 of Article X of the
99 Missouri Constitution, except in redevelopment project areas
100 in which tax increment financing has been adopted by
101 ordinance pursuant to a plan approved by vote of the
102 governing body of the municipality taken after August 13,
103 1982, and before January 1, 1998.
104 2. In addition to the payments in lieu of taxes
105 described in subdivision (2) of subsection 1 of this
106 section, for redevelopment plans and projects adopted or
107 redevelopment projects approved by ordinance after July 12,
SB 1242 20
108 1990, and prior to August 31, 1991, fifty percent of the
109 total additional revenue from taxes, penalties and interest
110 imposed by the municipality, or other taxing districts,
111 which are generated by economic activities within the area
112 of the redevelopment project over the amount of such taxes
113 generated by economic activities within the area of the
114 redevelopment project in the calendar year prior to the
115 adoption of the redevelopment project by ordinance, while
116 tax increment financing remains in effect, but excluding
117 taxes imposed on sales or charges for sleeping rooms paid by
118 transient guests of hotels and motels, taxes levied pursuant
119 to section 70.500, licenses, fees or special assessments
120 other than payments in lieu of taxes and any penalty and
121 interest thereon, or, effective January 1, 1998, taxes
122 levied pursuant to section 94.660, for the purpose of public
123 transportation, shall be allocated to, and paid by the local
124 political subdivision collecting officer to the treasurer or
125 other designated financial officer of the municipality, who
126 shall deposit such funds in a separate segregated account
127 within the special allocation fund. Any provision of an
128 agreement, contract or covenant entered into prior to July
129 12, 1990, between a municipality and any other political
130 subdivision which provides for an appropriation of other
131 municipal revenues to the special allocation fund shall be
132 and remain enforceable.
133 3. In addition to the payments in lieu of taxes
134 described in subdivision (2) of subsection 1 of this
135 section, for redevelopment plans and projects adopted or
136 redevelopment projects approved by ordinance after August
137 31, 1991, fifty percent of the total additional revenue from
138 taxes, penalties and interest which are imposed by the
139 municipality or other taxing districts, and which are
SB 1242 21
140 generated by economic activities within the area of the
141 redevelopment project over the amount of such taxes

144 adoption of the redevelopment project by ordinance, while
145 tax increment financing remains in effect, but excluding

147 for sleeping rooms paid by transient guests of hotels and

154 lieu of taxes and penalties and interest thereon, any sales
155 tax imposed by a county with a charter form of government
156 and with more than six hundred thousand but fewer than seven
157 hundred thousand inhabitants, for the purpose of sports
158 stadium improvement or levied by such county under section
159 238.410 for the purpose of the county transit authority
160 operating transportation facilities, or for redevelopment
161 plans and projects adopted or redevelopment projects
162 approved by ordinance after August 28, 2013, taxes imposed
163 on sales under and pursuant to section 67.700 or 650.399 for
164 the purpose of emergency communication systems, shall be
165 allocated to, and paid by the local political subdivision
166 collecting officer to the treasurer or other designated
167 financial officer of the municipality, who shall deposit
168 such funds in a separate segregated account within the
169 special allocation fund. Beginning August 28, 2014, if the
170 voters in a taxing district vote to approve an increase in
171 such taxing district's sales tax or use tax, other than the
SB 1242 22
172 renewal of an expiring sales or use tax, any additional
173 revenues generated within an existing redevelopment project
174 area that are directly attributable to the newly voter-
175 approved incremental increase in such taxing district's levy
176 rate shall not be considered economic activity taxes subject
177 to deposit into a special allocation fund without the
178 consent of such taxing district.
179 4. Beginning January 1, 1998, for redevelopment plans
180 and projects adopted or redevelopment projects approved by
181 ordinance and which have complied with subsections 4 to 12
182 of this section, in addition to the payments in lieu of
183 taxes and economic activity taxes described in subsections
184 1, 2 and 3 of this section, up to fifty percent of the new
185 state revenues, as defined in subsection 8 of this section,

187 identified by the municipality in the application required
188 by subsection 10 of this section, over and above the amount
189 of such taxes reported by businesses within the project area
190 as identified by the municipality in their application prior
191 to the approval of the redevelopment project by ordinance,
192 while tax increment financing remains in effect, may be
193 available for appropriation by the general assembly as
194 provided in subsection 10 of this section to the department
195 of economic development supplemental tax increment financing
196 fund, from the general revenue fund, for distribution to the
197 treasurer or other designated financial officer of the
198 municipality with approved plans or projects.
199 5. The treasurer or other designated financial officer
200 of the municipality with approved plans or projects shall
201 deposit such funds in a separate segregated account within

203 99.805.

204 6. No transfer from the general revenue fund to the
205 Missouri supplemental tax increment financing fund shall be
206 made unless an appropriation is made from the general
207 revenue fund for that purpose. No municipality shall commit
208 any state revenues prior to an appropriation being made for
209 that project. For all redevelopment plans or projects
210 adopted or approved after December 23, 1997, appropriations
211 from the new state revenues shall not be distributed from
212 the Missouri supplemental tax increment financing fund into
213 the special allocation fund unless the municipality's
214 redevelopment plan ensures that one hundred percent of
215 payments in lieu of taxes and fifty percent of economic
216 activity taxes generated by the project shall be used for
217 eligible redevelopment project costs while tax increment
218 financing remains in effect. This account shall be separate
219 from the account into which payments in lieu of taxes are
220 deposited, and separate from the account into which economic
221 activity taxes are deposited.
222 7. In order for the redevelopment plan or project to
223 be eligible to receive the revenue described in subsection 4
224 of this section, the municipality shall comply with the
225 requirements of subsection 10 of this section prior to the
226 time the project or plan is adopted or approved by
227 ordinance. The director of the department of economic
228 development and the commissioner of the office of
229 administration may waive the requirement that the
230 municipality's application be submitted prior to the
231 redevelopment plan's or project's adoption or the
232 redevelopment plan's or project's approval by ordinance.
233 8. For purposes of this section, "new state revenues"
234 means:
SB 1242 24
235 (1) The incremental increase in the general revenue
236 portion of state sales tax revenues received pursuant to

242 no event shall the incremental increase include any amounts
243 attributable to retail sales unless the municipality or
244 authority has proven to the Missouri development finance
245 board and the department of economic development and such
246 entities have made a finding that the sales tax increment
247 attributable to retail sales is from new sources which did
248 not exist in the state during the baseline year. The
249 incremental increase in the general revenue portion of state
250 sales tax revenues for an existing or relocated facility
251 shall be the amount that current state sales tax revenue
252 exceeds the state sales tax revenue in the base year as
253 stated in the redevelopment plan as provided in subsection
254 10 of this section; or
255 (2) The state income tax withheld on behalf of new
256 employees by the employer pursuant to section 143.221 at the

259 this section shall be the municipality's estimate of the
260 amount of state income tax withheld by the employer within
261 the redevelopment area for new employees who fill new jobs
262 directly created by the tax increment financing project.
263 9. Subsection 4 of this section shall apply only to

285 (2) Blighted areas consisting solely of the site of a
286 former automobile manufacturing plant located in any county

290 a redevelopment area containing a minimum of one hundred
291 acres, and such redevelopment area was previously used
292 primarily for the manufacture of automobiles but ceased such
293 manufacturing after the 2007 calendar year; [or]
294 (3) Blighted areas consisting solely of the site of a
295 former insurance company national service center containing

303 4 of this section shall not be made to or distributed by the

522 12. There is hereby established within the state
523 treasury a special fund to be known as the "Missouri
524 Supplemental Tax Increment Financing Fund", to be
525 administered by the department of economic development. The
526 department shall annually distribute from the Missouri
527 supplemental tax increment financing fund the amount of the
528 new state revenues as appropriated as provided in the
529 provisions of subsection 4 of this section if and only if
530 the conditions of subsection 10 of this section are met.
531 The fund shall also consist of any gifts, contributions,
532 grants or bequests received from federal, private or other
533 sources. Moneys in the Missouri supplemental tax increment
534 financing fund shall be disbursed per project pursuant to
535 state appropriations.
536 13. Redevelopment project costs may include, at the
537 prerogative of the state, the portion of salaries and
538 expenses of the department of economic development and the
539 department of revenue reasonably allocable to each
540 redevelopment project approved for disbursements from the
541 Missouri supplemental tax increment financing fund for the
542 ongoing administrative functions associated with such
543 redevelopment project. Such amounts shall be recovered from
544 new state revenues deposited into the Missouri supplemental
545 tax increment financing fund created under this section.
546 14. For redevelopment plans or projects approved by
547 ordinance that result in net new jobs from the relocation of
548 a national headquarters from another state to the area of
549 the redevelopment project, the economic activity taxes and
550 new state tax revenues shall not be based on a calculation
551 of the incremental increase in taxes as compared to the base
SB 1242 34
552 year or prior calendar year for such redevelopment project,
553 rather the incremental increase shall be the amount of total
554 taxes generated from the net new jobs brought in by the
555 national headquarters from another state. In no event shall
556 this subsection be construed to allow a redevelopment
557 project to receive an appropriation in excess of up to fifty
558 percent of the new state revenues.
559 15. Notwithstanding any other provision of the law to
560 the contrary, the adoption of any tax increment financing
561 authorized under sections 99.800 to 99.865 shall not
562 supersede, alter, or reduce in any way a property tax levied
563 under section 205.971.
564 16. In addition to the other provisions of this
565 section, no redevelopment project shall occur in a
566 redevelopment area unless:
567 (1) All school districts in such redevelopment area
568 have low fiscal capacity;
569 (2) All census blocks or census block groups, as
570 established in the most recent census, in such redevelopment
571 area have high unemployment; or
572 (3) All municipalities, census blocks, or census block
573 groups, as established in the most recent census, in such
