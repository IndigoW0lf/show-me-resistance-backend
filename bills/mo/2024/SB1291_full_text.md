AN ACT
To amend chapter 72, RSMo, by adding thereto one new section relating to fire protection services
to annexed areas in certain counties.
Be it enacted by the General Assembly of the State of Missouri, as follows:
1 Section A. Chapter 72, RSMo, is amended by adding thereto
2 one new section, to be known as section 72.440, to read as
3 follows:
1 72.440. Notwithstanding any other provision of law to
2 the contrary, any fire protection district serving an area
3 included within any annexation by a city located in a first
4 or second class county shall continue to provide fire
5 protection services to such area. The annexing city shall
6 pay annually to the fire protection district an amount equal
7 to that which the fire protection district would have levied
8 on all taxable property within the annexed area. Such
9 annexed area shall not be subject to taxation for any
10 purpose thereafter by the fire protection district except
11 for bonded indebtedness by the fire protection district
12 which existed prior to the annexation. The amount to be
13 paid annually by the municipality to the fire protection
14 district shall be a sum equal to the annual assessed value
15 multiplied by the annual tax rate as certified by the fire
16 protection district to the municipality, per one hundred
17 dollars of assessed value in such area. The tax rate shall
18 include any tax on bonded indebtedness incurred subsequent
SB 1291 2
19 to such annexation, but shall not include any portion of the
20 tax rate for bonded indebtedness incurred prior to such
21 annexation. Notwithstanding any other provision of law to
22 the contrary, the residents of an area annexed may vote in
23 all fire protection district elections and may be elected to
24 the fire protection district board of directors.
