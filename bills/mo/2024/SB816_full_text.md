SB 816 3
50 computerized voting system with the ability to provide a
51 paper audit trail. Notwithstanding any provisions of this
52 chapter to the contrary, such a system may allow for the
53 storage of processed ballot materials in an electronic form.
54 4. Any rule or portion of a rule, as that term is
55 defined in section 536.010, that is created under the
56 authority delegated in this section shall become effective
57 only if it complies with and is subject to all of the

65 invalid and void.
66 5. If any election authority uses any touchscreen
67 direct-recording electronic vote-counting machine, the

69 the removal of such voting machine from the election
70 authority's inventory because of mechanical malfunction,
71 wear and tear, or any other reason, the machine shall not be
72 replaced and no additional direct-recording electronic vote-
73 counting machine shall be added to the election authority's
74 inventory. Such machines shall not be used beginning
75 January 1, 2024. Equipment that is designed for
76 accessibility shall provide a paper ballot audit trail.
77 6. (1) Each election authority that controls its own
78 information technology department shall, once every two

80 secretary of state or alternatively by an entity that
81 specializes in cyber security reviews. Each political
SB 816 4
82 subdivision that controls the information technology
83 department for an election authority shall, once every two
84 years, allow a cyber security review of the information
85 technology department by the secretary of state or
86 alternatively by an entity that specializes in cyber
87 security reviews. The secretary of state shall, once every
88 two years, allow a cyber security review of its office by an
89 entity that specializes in cyber security reviews. For
90 purposes of this section, an entity specializes in cyber

92 (a) Have at least five years management experience in
93 information security or five years' experience as an
94 information security analyst;
95 (b) Have worked in at least two of the domains listed

100 of the following topics:
101 a. Information technology risk management,
102 identification, mitigation, and compliance;
103 b. Information security incident management;
104 c. Information security program development and
105 management;

113 development.
SB 816 5
114 (2) If an election authority or political subdivision
115 fails to have a cyber security review as required by this
116 subsection, the secretary of state may publish a notice of
117 noncompliance in a newspaper within the jurisdiction of the
118 election authority or in electronic format. The secretary
119 of state is also authorized to withhold funds from an
120 election authority in violation of this section unless such
121 funding is a federal mandate or part of a federal and state
122 agreement.
123 7. The secretary of state shall have authority to
124 require cyber security testing, including penetration
125 testing, of vendor machines, programs, and systems. Failure
126 to participate in such testing shall result in a revocation
127 of vendor certification. Upon notice from another
128 jurisdiction of cyber security failures or certification
129 withholds or revocation, the secretary of state shall have
130 authority to revoke or withhold certification for vendors.
131 The requirements of this section shall be subject to
132 appropriation for the purpose of cyber security testing.
133 8. The secretary of state may designate an
134 organization of which each election authority shall be a
135 member, provided there is no membership fee and the
136 organization provides information to increase cyber security
137 and election integrity efforts.
138 9. All audits required by subsection 6 of this section
139 that are conducted by the secretary of state shall be solely
140 paid for by state and federal funding.
141 10. (1) As used in this subsection, the following
142 terms mean:
143 (a) "Corresponding source", for an electronic voting
144 system in object code form, all the source code needed to
145 generate, install, and, for an executable electronic voting
SB 816 6
146 system, run the object code and to modify the electronic
147 voting system, including scripts to control those
148 activities. "Corresponding source" does not include the
149 electronic voting system's system libraries, general-purpose
150 tools, or generally available free programs that are used
151 unmodified in performing those activities but are not part
152 of the work. "Corresponding source" includes interface
153 definition files associated with source files for the
154 electronic voting system, the source code for shared
155 libraries, and dynamically linked subprograms that the
156 electronic voting system is specifically designed to
157 require, such as by intimate data communication or control
158 flow between those subprograms and other parts of the
159 electronic voting system;
160 (b) "Object code", any non-source form of an
161 electronic voting system;
162 (c) "Source code", the preferred form of the
163 electronic voting system for making modifications to it;
164 (d) "Standard interface", an interface that either is
165 an official standard defined by a recognized standards body,
166 or, in the case of interfaces specified for a particular
167 programming language, one that is widely used among
168 developers working in that language;
169 (e) "System libraries", a catalog of an executable
170 electronic voting system, including anything, other than the
171 electronic voting system as a whole, that is included in the
172 normal form of packaging a major component but is not part
173 of that major component and serves only to enable use of the
174 electronic voting system with that major component or to
175 implement a standard interface for which an implementation
176 is available to the public in source code form. As used in
177 this paragraph, a "major component" is a major essential
SB 816 7
178 component including, but not limited to, a kernel or window
179 system of the specific operating system on which the
180 executable electronic voting system runs, a compiler used to
181 produce the electronic voting system, or an object code
182 interpreter used to run it.
183 (2) Any software, or hardware containing software or
184 firmware, used in an electronic voting system in this state
185 shall have the full corresponding source code of the
186 software or firmware made publicly available by the
187 secretary of state at no cost, upon request of any resident
188 or citizen of this state. The full corresponding source
189 code provided shall exactly match the code necessary to
190 recreate any object code currently being used or deployed by
191 the state or any of its political subdivisions for election
192 tabulation purposes. Additionally, the full corresponding
193 source code for any software or firmware used for election
194 tabulation purposes in prior elections shall be retained by
195 the secretary of state and made available upon request for a
196 period of ten years after the certification of the results
197 of the relevant election.
198 (3) The corresponding source shall not be required to
199 include anything that users can regenerate automatically
200 from other parts of the corresponding source.
201 (4) The corresponding source for an electronic voting
202 system in source code form is that same electronic voting
203 system.
1 Section B. The repeal and reenactment of section
2 115.225 of this act shall become effective January 1, 2025.
