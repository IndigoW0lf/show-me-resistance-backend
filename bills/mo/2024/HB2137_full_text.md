28 4. The department of public safety may authorize expenditures for law enforcement
29 agencies or prosecuting attorneys' offices to provide for the health, safety, and welfare of

60 become effective only if it complies with and is subject to all of the provisions of chapter
61 536 and, if applicable, section 536.028. This section and chapter 536 are nonseverable
62 and if any of the powers vested with the general assembly pursuant to chapter 536 to
63 review, to delay the effective date, or to disapprove and annul a rule are subsequently
64 held unconstitutional, then the grant of rulemaking authority and any rule proposed or
