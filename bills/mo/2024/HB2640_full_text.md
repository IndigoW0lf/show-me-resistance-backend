87 to be prosecuted under the general law, it shall set a date for the hearing upon the petition as

211.072. 1. A juvenile under eighteen years of age who has been certified to stand
2 trial as an adult for offenses pursuant to section 211.071, if currently placed in a secure
3 juvenile detention facility, shall remain in a secure juvenile detention facility pending
4 finalization of the judgment and completion of appeal, if any, of the judgment dismissing the
5 juvenile petition to allow for prosecution under the general law unless otherwise ordered by
6 the juvenile court. Upon the judgment dismissing the petition to allow prosecution under the
7 general laws becoming final and adult charges being filed, if the juvenile is currently in a
8 secure juvenile detention facility, the juvenile shall remain in such facility unless the juvenile
9 posts bond or the juvenile is transferred to an adult jail. If the juvenile officer does not
10 believe juvenile detention would be the appropriate placement or would continue to serve as
11 the appropriate placement, the juvenile officer may file a motion in the adult criminal case
12 requesting that the juvenile be transferred from a secure juvenile detention facility to an adult
13 jail. Thecourt shall hearevidence relatingto the appropriatenessof thejuvenile remainingin

20 juvenile was certified; counsel for the juvenile officer; and representatives of the county
21 proposed to have custody of the pretrial-certified juvenile.
22 2. Following the hearing, the court shall order that the juvenile continue to be held in
23 a secure juvenile detention facility subject to all Missouri juvenile detention standards, or the
24 court shall order that the pretrial-certified juvenile be held in an adult jail but only after the
25 court has made findings that it would be in the best interest of justice to move the pretrial-
26 certified juvenile to an adult jail. The court shall weigh the following factors when deciding
27 whether to detain a certified juvenile in an adult facility:
HB 2640 5
28 (1) The certified juvenile's age;
29 (2) The certified juvenile's physical and mental maturity;
30 (3) The certified juvenile's present mental state, including whether he or she presents
31 an imminent risk of self-harm;
32 (4) The nature and circumstances of the charges;
33 (5) The certified juvenile's history of delinquency;
34 (6) The relative ability of the available adult and juvenile facilities to both meet the
35 needs of the certified juvenile and to protect the public and other youth in their custody;
36 (7) The opinion of the juvenile officer in the circuit of the proposed placement as to
37 the ability of that juvenile detention facility to provide for appropriate care, custody, and
38 control of the pretrial-certified juvenile; and
39 (8) Any other relevant factor.
40 3. In the event the court finds that it is in the best interest of justice to require the
41 certified juvenile to be held in an adult jail, the court shall hold a hearing once every thirty
42 days to determine whether the placement of the certified juvenile in an adult jail is still in the
43 best interests of justice. If a pretrial-certified juvenile under eighteen years of age is
44 ordered released on the juvenile's adult criminal case from an adult jail following a
45 transferorderundersubsection2ofthissectionandthejuvenileisdetainedonviolation
46 of the conditions of release or bond, the juvenile shall return to the custody of the adult
47 jail pending further court order.

51 grantedunderthissubsection,thecertifiedjuvenileshallbetransferredfromtheadultjailtoa
52 secure juvenile detention facility. If an extension is granted under this subsection, the
53 court shall hold a hearing once every thirty days to determine whether the placement of
54 the certified juvenile in an adult jail is still in the best interests of justice.
55 5. Effective December 31, 2021, all previously pretrial-certified juveniles under
56 eighteen years of age who had been certified prior to August 28, 2021, shall be transferred
57 from adult jail to a secure juvenile detention facility, unless a hearing is held and the court
58 finds, based upon the factors in subsection 2 of this section, that it would be in the best
59 interest of justice to keep the juvenile in the adult jail.
60 6. All pretrial-certified juveniles under eighteen years of age who are held in adult
61 jails pursuant to the best interest of justice exception shall continue to be subject to the
62 protections of the Prison Rape Elimination Act (PREA) and shall be physically separated

11 review the treatment plan to be provided by the division. The division shall notify the court
12 of original jurisdiction from which the child was committed at least three weeks prior to the
13 child's release to aftercare supervision. The notification shall include a summary of the
14 treatment plan and progress of the child that has resulted in the planned release. The court
15 may formally object to the director of the division in writing, stating its reasons in opposition
16 to the release. The director shall review the court's objection in consideration of its final
HB 2640 7

27 diseases to it for treatment in such institution. Notice of any such regulation shall be
28 promptly mailed to the judges and juvenile officers of all courts having jurisdiction of cases
29 involving children.

31 examine the individual and investigate all pertinent circumstances of his background for the
32 purpose of facilitating the placement and treatment of the child in the most appropriate
33 program or residential facility to assure the public safety and the rehabilitation of the child;
34 except that, no child committed under the provisions of subdivision (2) of subsection 1 of
35 section 211.031 may be placed in the residential facilities designated by the division as a
36 maximum security facility, unless the juvenile is subsequently adjudicated under subdivision

42 agency shall accept the child if the services are available by that agency.

49 months. Reports of the results of such examinations shall be sent to the child's committing
50 court and to his parents or guardian.
