assessment of virtual school students.
Be it enacted by the General Assembly of the state of Missouri, as follows:
Section A. Section 161.670, RSMo, is repealed and one new section enacted in lieu
2 thereof, to be known as section 161.670, to read as follows:
161.670. 1. Notwithstanding any other law, prior to July 1, 2007, the state board of
2 education shall establish the "Missouri Course Access and Virtual School Program" to serve
3 school-age students residing in the state. The Missouri course access and virtual school
4 program shall offer nonclassroom-based instruction in a virtual setting using technology,
5 intranet, or internet methods of communication. Any student under the age of twenty-one in
6 grades kindergarten through twelve who resides in this state shall be eligible to enroll in the

12 shall only be included in any district pupil attendance calculation under chapter 163 and any
13 charter school pupil attendance calculation under section 160.415, using current-year pupil
14 attendancefor such full-time virtual programpupils; and further providedthat in the caseof a

20 state aid calculation by the department, and the department shall pay, from funds dedicated to
21 state school aid payments made under section 163.031, to such institution an amount equal to
22 the state adequacy target multiplied by the weighted average daily attendance of such full-
23 time students.
24 (2) The Missouri course access and virtual school program shall report to the district
25 of residence the following information about each student served by the Missouri course
26 access and virtual school program: name, address, eligibility for free or reduced-price lunch,
27 limited English proficiency status, special education needs, and the number of courses in
28 which the student is enrolled. The Missouri course access and virtual school program shall
29 promptly notify the resident district when a student discontinues enrollment. A "full-time
30 equivalent student" is a student who is enrolled in the instructional equivalent of six credits
31 per regular term. Each Missouri course access and virtual school program course shall count
32 as one class and shall generate that portion of a full-time equivalent that a comparable course
33 offered by the school district would generate.
34 (3) Pursuant to an education services plan and collaborative agreement under
35 subsection 3 of this section, full-time equivalent students may be allowed to use a physical
36 locationoftheresidentschooldistrictforallorsomeportionofongoinginstructionalactivity,

40 attendance for a single student be used to claim state aid. Full-time equivalent student credit
41 completed shall be reported to the department of elementary and secondary education in the
42 manner prescribed by the department. Nothing in this section shall prohibit students from
43 enrolling in additional courses under a separate agreement that includes terms for paying
44 tuition or course fees.
45 (5) A full-time virtual school program serving full-time equivalent students shall be
46 considered an attendance center in the host school district and shall participate in the
47 statewide assessment system as defined in section 160.518. The academic performance of
48 students enrolled in a full-time virtual school program shall be assigned to the designated
49 attendance center of the full-time virtual school program and shall be considered in like
50 mannertootherattendancecenters. Theacademicperformanceofanystudentwhodisenrolls
51 from a full-time virtual school program and enrolls in a public school or charter school shall
52 not be used in determining the annual performance report score of the attendance center or
53 school district in which the student enrolls for twelve months from the date of enrollment.
HB 1820 3
54 (6) For the purposes of this section, a public institution of higher education operating
55 a full-time virtual school program shall be subject to all requirements applicable to a host
56 school district with respect to its full-time equivalent students.
57 3. (1) A student who resides in this state may enroll in Missouri course access and
58 virtual school program courses of his or her choice as a part of the student's annual course
59 load each school year, with any costs associated with such course or courses to be paid by the
60 school district or charter school if:
61 (a) The student is enrolled full-time in a public school, including any charter school;
62 and
63 (b) Prior to enrolling in any Missouri course access and virtual school program
64 course, a student has received approval from his or her school district or charter school
65 through the procedure described under subdivision (2) of this subsection.
66 (2) Each school district or charter school shall adopt a policy that delineates the
67 process by which a student may enroll in courses provided by the Missouri course access and
68 virtual school program that is substantially similar to the typical process by which a district
69 student would enroll in courses offered by the school district and a charter school student
70 would enroll in courses offered by the charter school. The policy may include consultation
71 withtheschool'scounselorandmayincludeparentalnotificationorauthorization. Thepolicy
72 shall ensure that available opportunities for in-person instruction are considered prior to
73 moving a student to virtual courses. The policy shall allow for continuous enrollment
74 throughout the school year. If the school district or charter school disapproves a student's
75 request to enroll in a course or courses provided by the Missouri course access and virtual
76 school program, the reason shall be provided in writing and it shall be for good cause. Good
77 cause justification to disapprove a student's request for enrollment in a course shall be a
78 determination that doing so is not in the best educational interest of the student, and shall be
79 consistent with the determination that would be made for such course request under the
80 process by which a district student would enroll in a similar course offered by the school
81 district and a charter school student would enroll in a similar course offered by the charter
82 school, except that the determination may consider the suitability of virtual courses for the
83 student based on prior participation in virtual courses by the student. Appeals of any course
84 denials under this subsection shall be considered under a policythat is substantially similar to
85 the typical process by which appeals would be considered for a student seeking to enroll in
86 courses offered by the school district and a charter school student seeking to enroll in courses
87 offered by the charter school.
88 (3) For students enrolled in any Missouri course access and virtual school program
89 course in which costs associated with such course are to be paid by the school district or
90 charter school as described under this subdivision, the school district or charter school shall
HB 1820 4
91 pay the content provider directly on a pro rata monthly basis based on a student's completion
92 of assignments and assessments. If a student discontinues enrollment, the district or charter
93 school may stop making monthly payments to the content provider. No school district or
94 charter school shall pay, for any one course for a student, more than the market necessary
95 costs but in no case shall pay more than fourteen percent of the state adequacy target, as
96 defined under section 163.011, as calculated at the end of the most recent school year for any
97 single, year-long course and no more than seven percent of the state adequacy target as
98 described above for any single semester equivalent course.

122 portion of such services;
123 (g) Require the virtual program to determine whether an enrolling student will be

133 survey results will be published in a manner that reveals individual student information. The
134 department shall also include, in the annual report, data at the statewide and district levels of
135 sufficient detail to allow detection and analysis of the racial, ethnic, and socio-economic
136 balance of virtual program participation among schools and districts at the statewide and
137 district levels, provided that no such survey results will be published in a manner that reveals
138 individual student information.
