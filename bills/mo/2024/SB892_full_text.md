72 of multiple telephone companies, after August 28, 2018, it
73 shall make its one-time election to be assessed using the
74 methodology for property tax purposes as described under
75 paragraph (b) of subdivision (1) of this subsection within
76 the year in which the telephone company begins its
77 operations. A telephone company that fails to make a timely
78 election shall be deemed to have elected to be assessed
79 using the methodology for property tax purposes as provided
80 under subsections 1 to 4 of this section.
81 (2) The provisions of this subsection shall not be
82 construed to change the original assessment jurisdiction of

86 (4) (a) The provisions of this subdivision shall
87 ensure that school districts may avoid any fiscal impact as
SB 892 9
88 a result of a telephone company being assessed under the
89 provisions of paragraph (b) of subdivision (1) of this
90 subsection. If a school district's current operating levy
91 is below the greater of its most recent voter-approved tax
92 rate or the most recent voter-approved tax rate as adjusted
93 under subdivision (2) of subsection 5 of section 137.073, it
94 shall comply with section 137.073.

97 the most recent voter-approved tax rate or the most recent

99 subsection 5 of section 137.073 that receives less tax
100 revenue from a specific telephone company under this
101 subsection, on or before January thirty-first of the year
102 following the tax year in which the school district received
103 less revenue from a specific telephone company, may by
104 resolution of the school board impose a fee, as determined
105 under this subsection, in order to obtain such revenue. The
106 resolution shall include all facts that support the
107 imposition of the fee. If the school district receives
108 voter approval to raise its tax rate, the district shall no
109 longer impose the fee authorized in this paragraph.
110 (c) Any fee imposed under paragraph (b) of this
111 subdivision shall be determined by taking the difference
112 between the tax revenue the telephone company paid in the
113 tax year in question and the tax revenue the telephone
114 company would have paid in such year had it not made an
115 election under subdivision (1) of this subsection, which
116 shall be calculated by taking the telephone company
117 valuations in the tax year in question, as determined by the
118 state tax commission under paragraph (d) of this
119 subdivision, and applying such valuations to the
SB 892 10
120 apportionment process in subsection 2 of section 151.150.
121 The school district shall issue a billing, as provided in
122 this subdivision, to any such telephone company. A
123 telephone company shall have forty-five days after receipt
124 of a billing to remit its payment of its portion of the fees
125 to the school district. Notwithstanding any other provision
126 of law, the issuance or receipt of such fee shall not be
127 used:
128 a. In determining the amount of state aid that a
129 school district receives under section 163.031;
130 b. In determining the amount that may be collected
131 under a property tax levy by such district; or
132 c. For any other purpose.
133 For the purposes of accounting, a telephone company that
134 issues a payment to a school district under this subsection
135 shall treat such payment as a tax.
136 (d) When establishing the valuation of a telephone
137 company assessed under paragraph (b) of subdivision (1) of
138 this subsection, the state tax commission shall also
139 determine the difference between the assessed value of a
140 telephone company if:
141 a. Assessed under paragraph (b) of subdivision (1) of
142 this subsection; and
143 b. Assessed exclusively under subsections 1 to 4 of
144 this section.
145 The state tax commission shall then apportion such amount to
146 each county and provide such information to any school
147 district making a request for such information.
148 (e) This subsection shall expire when no school
149 district is eligible for a fee.

151 pursuant to this chapter has ownership of any real or
152 personal property associated with a project which uses solar

155 any local authorities having jurisdiction under the
156 provisions of chapter 137 and other relevant provisions of
157 the law.
