80 published within the county, in a newspaper published in an
81 adjoining county, for three weeks consecutively, the last
82 insertion of which shall be at least ten days and not more
83 than thirty days before the day of the election, and by
84 posting printed notices thereof at three of the most public
85 places in each township in the county. The proposition
86 shall be put before the voters substantially in the
87 following form:

97 time position of county prosecutor a part-time position
98 under subsection 4 of this section, the county's retirement

104 proposition under subsection 4 of this section shall be
SB 1189 9
105 maintained by the retirement system and used to calculate
106 the retirement benefit for such prior full-time position
107 service. Under no circumstances shall a member in a part-
108 time prosecutor position earn full-time position retirement
109 benefit service accruals for time periods after the
110 effective date of the proposition changing the county
111 prosecutor back to a part-time position.
