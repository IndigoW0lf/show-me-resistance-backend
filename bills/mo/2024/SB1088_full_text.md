43 [forty] sixty percent of his or her sentence or until the
44 offender attains seventy years of age, and has served at
45 least thirty percent of the sentence imposed, whichever
46 occurs first, and the term of conditional release from
47 prison or the parole term shall end no earlier than the last
48 day of the entire sentence;
49 (2) If the offender has two previous prison
50 commitments to the department of corrections for felonies
SB 1088 3
51 unrelated to the present offense, the minimum prison term
52 which the offender must serve shall be [fifty] ninety
53 percent of his or her sentence or until the offender attains
54 seventy years of age, and has served at least forty percent
55 of the sentence imposed, whichever occurs first, and the
56 term of conditional release from prison or the parole term
57 shall end no earlier than the last day of the entire
58 sentence;
59 (3) If the offender has three or more previous prison
60 commitments to the department of corrections for felonies
61 unrelated to the present offense, the minimum prison term
62 which the offender must serve shall be [eighty] one hundred

68 notwithstanding, any offender who has been found guilty of a
69 dangerous felony as defined in section 556.061 and is

81 (2) Any sentence either alone or in the aggregate with
82 other consecutive sentences for offenses committed at or
SB 1088 4
83 near the same time which is over seventy-five years shall be
84 calculated to be seventy-five years.
85 5. For purposes of this section, the term "minimum
86 prison term" shall mean time required to be served by the
87 offender before he or she is eligible for parole,
88 conditional release or other early release by the department
89 of corrections.
90 6. An offender who was convicted of, or pled guilty
91 to, a felony offense other than those offenses listed in
92 subsection 2 of this section prior to August 28, 2019, shall
93 no longer be subject to the minimum prison term provisions
94 under subsection 2 of this section, and shall be eligible
95 for parole, conditional release, or other early release by
96 the department of corrections according to the rules and
97 regulations of the department.

SB 1088 5
114 (2) The commission shall study sentencing practices in
115 the circuit courts throughout the state for the purpose of

117 among the various circuit courts with respect to the length
118 of sentences imposed and the use of probation for offenders
119 convicted of the same or similar offenses and with similar
120 criminal histories. The commission shall also study and
121 examine whether and to what extent sentencing disparity
122 among economic and social classes exists in relation to the
123 sentence of death and if so, the reasons therefor, if
124 sentences are comparable to other states, if the length of
125 the sentence is appropriate, and the rate of rehabilitation
126 based on sentence. It shall compile statistics, examine
127 cases, draw conclusions, and perform other duties relevant
128 to the research and investigation of disparities in death
129 penalty sentencing among economic and social classes.
130 (3) The commission shall study alternative sentences,
131 prison work programs, work release, home-based
132 incarceration, probation and parole options, and any other
133 programs and report the feasibility of these options in
134 Missouri.
135 (4) The governor shall select a chairperson who shall
136 call meetings of the commission as required or permitted
137 pursuant to the purpose of the sentencing commission.
138 (5) The members of the commission shall not receive
139 compensation for their duties on the commission, but shall
140 be reimbursed for actual and necessary expenses incurred in
141 the performance of these duties and for which they are not
142 reimbursed by reason of their other paid positions.
143 (6) The circuit and associate circuit courts of this
144 state, the office of the state courts administrator, the
145 department of public safety, and the department of
SB 1088 6
146 corrections shall cooperate with the commission by providing
147 information or access to information needed by the
148 commission. The office of the state courts administrator
149 will provide needed staffing resources.
150 8. Courts shall retain discretion to lower or exceed
151 the sentence recommended by the commission as otherwise
152 allowable by law, and to order restorative justice methods,
153 when applicable.
154 9. If the imposition or execution of a sentence is
155 suspended, the court may order any or all of the following
156 restorative justice methods, or any other method that the
157 court finds just or appropriate:
158 (1) Restitution to any victim or a statutorily created
159 fund for costs incurred as a result of the offender's
160 actions;
161 (2) Offender treatment programs;
162 (3) Mandatory community service;
163 (4) Work release programs in local facilities; and
164 (5) Community-based residential and nonresidential
165 programs.
166 10. Pursuant to subdivision (1) of subsection 9 of
167 this section, the court may order the assessment and payment
168 of a designated amount of restitution to a county law
169 enforcement restitution fund established by the county
170 commission pursuant to section 50.565. Such contribution
171 shall not exceed three hundred dollars for any charged
172 offense. Any restitution moneys deposited into the county
173 law enforcement restitution fund pursuant to this section
174 shall only be expended pursuant to the provisions of section
175 50.565.
176 11. A judge may order payment to a restitution fund
177 only if such fund had been created by ordinance or
SB 1088 7
178 resolution of a county of the state of Missouri prior to
179 sentencing. A judge shall not have any direct supervisory
180 authority or administrative control over any fund to which
181 the judge is ordering a person to make payment.
182 12. A person who fails to make a payment to a county
183 law enforcement restitution fund may not have his or her
184 probation revoked solely for failing to make such payment
185 unless the judge, after evidentiary hearing, makes a finding
186 supported by a preponderance of the evidence that the person
187 either willfully refused to make the payment or that the
188 person willfully, intentionally, and purposefully failed to
189 make sufficient bona fide efforts to acquire the resources
190 to pay.
191 13. Nothing in this section shall be construed to
192 allow the sentencing advisory commission to issue
193 recommended sentences in specific cases pending in the
194 courts of this state.
