AN ACT
To repeal section 167.061, RSMo, and to enact in lieu thereof one new section relating to
compulsory school attendance, with a penalty provision.
Be it enacted by the General Assembly of the state of Missouri, as follows:
Section A. Section 167.061, RSMo, is repealed and one new section enacted in lieu
2 thereof, to be known as section 167.061, to read as follows:
167.061. Any parent, guardian or other person having charge, control or custody of a
2 child, who violates the provisions of section 167.031 is guilty of [a class C misdemeanor] an
3 infraction. Upon conviction and pending any judicial appeal, the defendant shall be required
4 to enroll the child in a public, private, parochial, parish or home school within three public
5 school days, after which each successive school day shall constitute a separate violation of
6 section 167.031. The fine [or imprisonment, or both,] may be suspended and finally remitted
7 by the court, with or without the payment of costs, at the discretion of the court, if the child is
8 immediately placed and kept in regular attendance at a public, private, parochial, parish or
9 home school and if the fact of regular attendance is proved subsequently to the satisfaction of
10 the court. A certificate stating that the child is regularly attending a public, private, parochial
11 or parish school and properly attested by the superintendent, principal or person in charge of
12 the school is prima facie evidence of regular attendance by the child.
