435.303. 1. A court may refer any individual civil case or category of civil cases

3 or court order.
4 2. Within thirty days of referral by a court to a nonbinding alternative dispute
5 resolution process under subsection 1 of this section, or such longer time as may be set
6 by the court, or with leave of the court, the parties may:
7 (1) Notify the court that all of the parties have chosen to pursue an alternative
8 dispute resolution process different from the nonbinding alternative dispute resolution
9 process ordered by the court if such choice is evidenced in a written agreement between
10 the parties;
11 (2) Notify the court that all of the parties have agreedto delay such process until
12 a date certain, which date may be subsequently modified by the court, to allow for the
13 exchange of specified information, the identification of representatives with authority,
14 or another identified action or event related to the ability of the parties to participate
15 effectively in that process; or
16 (3) File a motion for relief from the referral setting forth the reasons for not
17 participating if any party, afterconferring with all other parties, concludes that referral

20 substantive issues in the matter or there is a compelling circumstance for not
21 participating in the alternative dispute resolution process. Once a motion for relief has
22 beenfiled,thealternativedisputeresolutionprocessorderedbythecourtshallnotoccur

31 promote savings in time and expense without sacrificing the quality of justice.
HB 1456 4
32 4. Aneutralwhoisappointed bythecourtorrequestedbythepartiestoservein
33 a nonbinding alternative dispute resolution process under sections 435.300 to 435.312
34 shall avoid any conflict of interest. If the neutral believes that no disqualifying conflict
35 exists, the neutral shall:
36 (1) Make a reasonable inquiry to determine whether there are any facts that
37 would cause a reasonable person to believe that the neutral has an actual or potential
38 conflict of interest before agreeing to serve in a matter;
39 (2) Disclose to the parties, as soon as practicable, facts and information relevant
40 to any actual or potential conflicts of interest that are reasonably known to the neutral;
41 and
42 (3) If,afteracceptingadesignationbythepartiesorthecourt,theneutrallearns
43 of any previously undisclosed information that could reasonably suggest a conflict of
44 interest, promptly disclose the information to the parties.
45 5. After the neutral's disclosure of a conflict, the alternative dispute resolution
46 process may proceed if either:
47 (1) All parties agree in writing to service by the neutral; or
48 (2) An organization independently administering the alternative dispute
49 resolution process under rules of procedure that were adopted by a written
50 agreement of the parties determines under such rules that the neutral may continue
51 to serve.
52 6. Any party who believes a court-appointed neutral has a conflict of interest
53 may request that the neutral recuse himself or herself if a conflict is disclosed or
54 otherwisediscovered. Iftheneutraldeclines,thepartymaytimelyfileamotionwiththe
55 court for disqualification of the neutral. Failure to file a motion waives that objection.
56 On its own motion, the court may also review the choice of a neutral in any alternative
57 dispute resolution process involving a party that is not represented by counsel and
58 require a change of neutral if necessary to protect the rights of the unrepresented party.
435.306. 1. Alternative dispute resolution communications shall not be
2 admissible as evidence in any proceeding or subject to discovery, except as otherwise
3 provided under subsections 2, 3, and 7 of this section. Exceptions shall be narrowly
4 construed and only the portion of the communication necessary for the application of
5 the exception to the general rule of nonadmissibility shall be admitted.
6 2. Evidence or information that is otherwise admissible or subject to discovery,
7 including information that would be available to the public under sections 610.010 to
8 610.035, shall not become inadmissible or protected from discovery solely by reason of
9 its disclosure or use in an alternative dispute resolution process.

14 and admissible. The party seeking admission shall ensure that timely notice is given to
15 the neutral and parties that participated in the alternative dispute resolution process in
16 which the alternative dispute resolution communication was made. Such hearing shall
17 be conducted in camera if requested by a party or if the court determines on its own
18 motion that an in camera proceeding is necessary to ensure the confidentiality of the
19 communications that are the subject to the hearing. The only exceptions to the general
20 rule of nonadmissibility of alternative dispute resolution communications stated under
21 subsection 1 of this section are as follows:
22 (1) The alternative dispute resolution communication was made in the presence
23 of a mandated reporter and pertains to abuse or neglect that such person is required by
24 state law or regulation to report;

32 defend against a claim of professional misconduct or malpractice that is filed against or
33 on behalf of a participant based on conduct occurring during the alternative dispute
34 resolution process.
35 4. The admission of evidence in a proceeding under any of the exceptions stated
36 under subsection 3 of this section shall not in itself render the evidence or any other
37 alternative dispute resolution communication discoverable or admissible for any other
38 purpose or proceeding.
39 5. Any participant in an alternative dispute resolution process has standing to
40 intervene in any proceeding to object to the admissibility of an alternative dispute
41 resolution communication made by that person during or relating to that alternative
42 dispute resolution process. A neutral who participated in an alternative dispute
43 resolution process also has standing to intervene in any proceeding to object to the
44 admissibility of an alternative dispute resolution communication made by the neutral or
45 an agent or employee of a neutral or of an organization through which the neutral
HB 1456 6
46 provided the alternative dispute resolution services for such process, but the neutral is
47 under no requirement to do so.

63 the written agreement was signed by the parties in the presence of the neutral.
64 8. The court may request that the neutral or the parties provide the court with
65 progress reports on alternative dispute resolution processes related to pending civil
66 actions; provided that, such reports shall be limited to a statement that the matter has

4 rule or court order, or when the parties enter into a written agreement to resolve their
