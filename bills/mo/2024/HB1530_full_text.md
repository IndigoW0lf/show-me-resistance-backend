20 2. The director of revenue shall use reasonable diligence in ascertaining whether the
21 facts stated in such application are true and shall, to the extent possible without substantially
22 delaying processing of the application, review any odometer information pertaining to such
23 motor vehicle that is accessible to the director of revenue. If satisfied that the applicant is the
24 lawful owner of such motor vehicle or trailer, or otherwise entitled to have the same
25 registered in his name, the director shall thereupon issue an appropriate certificate over his
26 signature and sealed with the seal of his office, procured and used for such purpose. The
27 certificate shall contain on its face a complete description, vehicle identification number, and
28 other evidence of identification of the motor vehicle or trailer, as the director of revenue may
29 deem necessary, together with the odometer information required to be put on the face of the
30 certificate pursuant to section 407.536, a statement of any liens or encumbrances which the
31 application may show to be thereon, and, if ownership of the vehicle has been transferred, the
32 name of the state issuing the transferor's title and whether the transferor's odometer mileage
33 statement executed pursuant to section 407.536 indicated that the true mileage is materially
34 different from the number of miles shown on the odometer, or is unknown.
35 3. The director of revenue shall appropriately designate on the current and all
36 subsequentissuesofthecertificatethewords"ReconstructedMotorVehicle","MotorChange

44 and the date of purchase or issuance of the immediately prior certificate; or
45 (2) Any other mileage information provided to the director of revenue, and the date
46 the director obtained or recorded that information.
47 4. The certificate of ownership issued by the director of revenue shall be
48 manufactured in a manner to prohibit as nearly as possible the ability to alter, counterfeit,
49 duplicate, or forge such certificate without ready detection. In order to carry out the
50 requirements of this subsection, the director of revenue may contract with a nonprofit
51 scientific or educational institution specializing in the analysis of secure documents to
52 determine the most effective methods of rendering Missouri certificates of ownership
53 nonalterable or noncounterfeitable.

54 5. The fee for each original certificate so issued shall be eight dollars and fifty cents,
55 in addition to the fee for registration of such motor vehicle or trailer. If application for the
56 certificate is not made within thirty days after the vehicle is acquired by the applicant, or
57 where the motor vehicle was acquired under section 301.213 or subsection 5 of section
58 301.210 and the applicant fails to make application within thirty days after receiving title
59 from the dealer, a delinquency penalty fee of twenty-five dollars for the first thirty days of
60 delinquency and twenty-five dollars for each thirty days of delinquency thereafter, not to
61 exceed a total of two hundred dollars, but such penalty may be waived by the director for a
62 good cause shown. If the director of revenue learns that any person has failed to obtain a
63 certificate within thirty days after acquiring a motor vehicle or trailer, or where the motor
64 vehicle was acquired under section 301.213 or subsection 5 of section 301.210 and the
65 applicant fails to make application within thirty days after receiving title from the dealer, or
66 has sold a vehicle without obtaining a certificate, he shall cancel the registration of all
67 vehicles registered in the name of the person, either as sole owner or as a co-owner, and shall
68 notify the person that the cancellation will remain in force until the person pays the
69 delinquency penalty fee provided in this section, together with all fees, charges and payments
70 which the person should have paid in connection with the certificate of ownership and
71 registration of the vehicle. The certificate shall be good for the life of the motor vehicle or
72 trailer so long as the same is owned or held by the original holder of the certificate and shall
73 not have to be renewed annually.
74 6. Any applicant for a certificate of ownership requesting the department of revenue
75 to process an application for a certificate of ownership in an expeditious manner requiring
76 special handling shall pay a fee of five dollars in addition to the regular certificate of

79 required to be registered under the provisions of the law unless a certificate of ownership has

81 8. Before an original Missouri certificate of ownership is issued, an inspection of the
82 vehicle and a verification of vehicle identification numbers shall be made by the Missouri
83 state highway patrol on vehicles for which there is a current title issued by another state if a
84 Missouri salvage certificate of title has been issued for the same vehicle but no prior
85 inspection and verification has been made in this state, except that if such vehicle has been
86 inspected in another state by a law enforcement officer in a manner comparable to the
87 inspection process in this state and the vehicle identification numbers have been so verified,
88 the applicant shall not be liable for the twenty-five dollar inspection fee if such applicant
89 submits proof of inspection and vehicle identification number verification to the director of
90 revenue at the time of the application. The applicant, who has such a title for a vehicle on
HB 1530 4
91 which no prior inspection and verification have been made, shall pay a fee of twenty-five
92 dollars for such verification and inspection, payable to the director of revenue at the time of
93 the request for the application, which shall be deposited in the state treasury to the credit of
