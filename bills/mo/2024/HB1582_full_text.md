211.185. 1. In addition to the court's authority to issue an order for the child to make
2 restitution or reparation for the damage or loss caused by his offense as provided in section
3 211.181, the court may enter a judgment of restitution against both the parent and the child

20 4. Payment of restitution to a victim under this section has priority over payment of
21 restitution to any governmental entity.
22 5. Considering the age and circumstances of a child, the court may order the child to
23 make restitution to the wronged person personally.
24 6. A restitution hearing to determine the liability of the parent and the child shall be
25 held not later than thirty days after the disposition hearing and may be extended by the court
26 for good cause. In the restitution hearing, a written statement or bill for medical, dental,
27 hospital, funeral, or burial expenses shall be prima facie evidence that the amount indicated
28 on the written statement or bill represents a fair and reasonable charge for the services or

38 judgments.
39 9. A judgment of restitution ordered pursuant to this section against a child and his
40 parents shall not be a bar to a proceeding against the child and his parents pursuant to section
41 537.045 or section 8.150 for the balance of the damages not paid pursuant to this section. In
42 no event, however, may the total restitution paid by the child and his parents pursuant to this
43 section, section 8.150, and section 537.045 exceed [four] ten thousand dollars.
44 10. The child may be ordered to work in a court-approved community service work
45 site at a rate of compensation not to exceed minimum wage. The number of hours worked
46 shall be reported to the juvenile officer and the compensation earned for these hours shall be
47 used for the sole purpose of satisfying the judgment entered against the child in accordance
48 with this section. Upon application by the juvenile officer made with the juvenile court's
49 written approval, the clerk of the court of the circuit where the fund is deposited and where a
50 judgment has been entered in accordance with this section shall pay the compensation earned
51 by the child to the person in whose favor the judgment has been entered.
52 11. Notwithstanding any other provision of this section to the contrary, a judgment of
53 restitution ordered pursuant to this section against a child may be executed upon after the
54 child attains the age of eighteen years.
