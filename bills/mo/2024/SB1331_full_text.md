20 grant absent aggravating circumstances which, in the
21 discretion of the court, require denial of such a petition.
22 Any person granted an order of removal pursuant to this
23 subdivision who thereafter returns to this state in
24 violation of 8 U.S.C. Section 1325 shall be subject to the
25 remainder of any term of imprisonment to which the person

38 may, upon request, dismiss the charge pending against the
39 person and issue an order of removal, as provided in
40 subsection 3 of this section.
41 5. Any law enforcement officer whose duty it is to
