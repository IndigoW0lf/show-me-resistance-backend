Be it enacted by the General Assembly of the State of Missouri, as follows:
1 Section A. Section 136.370, RSMo, is repealed and one new

1 136.370. 1. Pursuant to chapter 143 and chapter 144,
2 the director shall waive any interest or penalty assessed
3 against any taxpayer when it is determined by the director,
4 the administrative hearing commission, or a court of law
5 that the negligence of an employee of the department
6 resulted in undue delay, as defined by rule or regulation,
7 in either assessing tax or notifying the taxpayer of the
8 liability owed. Such waiver of interest or penalty shall be
9 for that amount attributable to the period of delay and for
10 any time that the penalty or interest is under appeal.
11 2. Notwithstanding any provision of law to the
12 contrary, the director shall refund to a taxpayer the amount
13 of sales and use tax assessments paid by such taxpayer when
14 it is determined by the administrative hearing commission or
15 a court of law that the negligence of or incorrect
16 information provided by an employee of the department
17 resulted in the taxpayer failing to collect and remit sales
18 and use tax assessments that were required to be collected
SB 1233 2
19 and for which the department subsequently audited the
20 taxpayer. A taxpayer shall file a claim for refund no later
