SENATE RESOLUTION NO. 631
NOTICE OF PROPOSED RULE CHANGE
Notice is hereby given by the Senator from the 4th District of the one day notice
required by rule of intent to put a motion to adopt the following rule change:
BE IT RESOLVED by the Senate of the One Hundred and
Second General Assembly, Second Regular Session, that Senate
Rules 29 and 44 be amended to read as follows:
"Rule 29. 1. Senate offices and seats in the senate
chamber shall be assigned [by the committee on
administration to the majority and minority caucuses. Each
caucus shall make office and senate seat assignments] on the
basis of seniority as defined in this rule, [unless
otherwise determined within a caucus,] except that Rooms 326
and 327 shall be known as the president pro tem's office and
shall be occupied by the senate's president pro tem. Upon
retirement from service as pro tem, that senator shall
vacate the pro tem's office and shall have first choice of
available vacant offices [of his caucus,] regardless of his
seniority status. Except for the outgoing president pro tem,
who is required to vacate the designated pro tem's office,
no senator shall be required to relinquish any office or
seat once assigned to him.
2. Seniority shall be determined [by each caucus] on
the basis of length of service. Length of service means:
(a) Continuous senate service;
(b) In the case of equal continuous senate service,
prior non-continuous senate service;
(c) In the case of equal continuous and prior non-
continuous senate service, prior house service.
3. When two or more members [of the same party] have
the same length of service, their respective seniority shall
1
be determined by [their party caucus] the committee on
administration.
Rule 44. Beginning on July first of each year, members
and members-elect may deposit bills and joint resolutions
for the next regular session with the secretary of the
senate at any time. The secretary shall hold the bills and
joint resolutions so deposited in the order filed. After
the close of business on December first, the secretary shall
assign numbers to bills and joint resolutions deposited in
that office by seniority of the member first signing the
measure, with a limit of three bills or joint resolutions
per rotation of the seniority list from the total number of
measures deposited. All measures deposited through December
first shall stand as pre-filed without further action by the
member or member-elect. At the close of business on each
day thereafter until the opening day of the session, bills
and joint resolutions received during the day shall be
assigned numbers in the order in which the bill or joint
resolution is filed with the secretary.
Once filed, bills and joint resolutions shall not be
changed except to correct patent typographical, clerical or
drafting errors that do not involve changes of substance,
nor shall substitutions be made therefor. Any bill may be
withdrawn but the number shall not be reassigned once a
number has been given.
Seniority for the purposes of this rule shall be
determined as follows:
(1) Continuous senate service;
(2) [In the case of equal continuous senate service,
majority party members shall have seniority over minority
party members;
2
(3) In the case of equal continuous senate service by
members of the same party,] Prior non-continuous senate
service;
(4) In the case of equal continuous and prior non-
continuous senate service by [members of the same party,]
prior house service;
(5) In the case of equal continuous and equal prior
non-continuous senate service and equal prior house service
[by members of the same party,] seniority shall be
determined by the [caucus of that party] the committee on
administration.".
