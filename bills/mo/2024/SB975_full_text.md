15 (5) All property, real and personal, actually and
16 regularly used exclusively for religious worship, for
17 schools and colleges, or for purposes purely charitable and
18 not held for private or corporate profit, except that the
SB 975 2
19 exemption herein granted does not include real property not
20 actually used or occupied for the purpose of the

22 income or rentals received therefrom is used wholly for
23 religious, educational or charitable purposes;
24 (6) Household goods, furniture, wearing apparel and

35 (8) Real or personal property leased or otherwise
36 transferred by an interstate compact agency created pursuant
37 to sections 70.370 to 70.430 or sections 238.010 to 238.100
38 to another for which or whom such property is not exempt
39 when immediately after the lease or transfer, the interstate
40 compact agency enters into a leaseback or other agreement
41 that directly or indirectly gives such interstate compact
42 agency a right to use, control, and possess the property;
43 provided, however, that in the event of a conveyance of such
44 property, the interstate compact agency must retain an
45 option to purchase the property at a future date or, within
46 the limitations period for reverters, the property must
47 revert back to the interstate compact agency. Property will
48 no longer be exempt under this subdivision in the event of a
49 conveyance as of the date, if any, when:

55 property within the limitation period for reverters;
56 (9) All property, real and personal, belonging to
57 veterans' organizations. As used in this section,
58 "veterans' organization" means any organization of veterans

68 the assessment, levy, and collection of taxes such portion
69 of the property of such individual, corporation,
70 organization, or association that is used primarily for such
71 childcare.
1 Section B. The repeal and reenactment of section
2 137.100 shall become effective only upon the passage and
3 approval by the voters of an amendment to the Missouri
4 Constitution permitting an exemption from taxation of
5 property used primarily for the care of a child outside of
6 his or her home.
