workers' compensation benefits.
Be it enacted by the General Assembly of the state of Missouri, as follows:
Section A. Section 287.250, RSMo, is repealed and one new section enacted in lieu
2 thereof, to be known as section 287.250, to read as follows:
287.250. 1. Except as otherwise provided for in this chapter, the method of
2 computing an injured employee's average weekly earnings which will serve as the basis for
3 compensation provided for in this chapter shall be as follows:
4 (1) If the wages are fixed by the week, the amount so fixed shall be the average
5 weekly wage;
6 (2) If the wages are fixed by the month, the average weekly wage shall be the
7 monthly wage so fixed multiplied by twelve and divided by fifty-two;
8 (3) If the wages are fixed by the year, the average weekly wage shall be the yearly
9 wage fixed divided by fifty-two;
10 (4) If the wages were fixed by the day, hour, or by the output of the employee, the
11 average weekly wage shall be computed by dividing by thirteen the wages earned while
12 actually employed by the employer in each of the last thirteen calendar weeks immediately
13 preceding the week in which the employee was injured or if actually employed by the
14 employer for less than thirteen weeks, by the number of calendar weeks, or any portion of a
15 week, during which the employee was actually employed by the employer. For purposes of
16 computing the average weekly wage pursuant to this subdivision, absence of five regular or
17 scheduled work days, even if not in the same calendar week, shall be considered as absence

19 beginning of a calendar week, such calendar week and the wages earned during such week
20 shall be excluded in computing the average weekly wage pursuant to this subdivision;
21 (5) If the employee has been employed less than two calendar weeks immediately
22 preceding the injury, the employee's weekly wage shall be considered to be equivalent to the
23 average weekly wage prevailing in the same or similar employment at the time of the injury,
24 exceptif the employer has agreedto a certain hourly wage, then the hourly wage agreed upon
25 multiplied by the number of weekly hours scheduled shall be the employee's average weekly
26 wage;

34 actually paid by the employer as compensation for such labor.

36 payments for services rendered, the reasonable value of board, rent, housing, lodging or
37 similar advance received from the employer, except if such benefits continue to be provided
38 during the period of the disability, then the value of such benefits shall not be considered in
39 calculating the average weekly wage of the employee. The term "wages", as used in this
40 section, includes the value of any gratuities received in the course of employment from
41 persons other than the employer to the extent that such gratuities are reported for income tax
42 purposes. "Wages", as used in this section, does not include fringe benefits such as

55 4. If pursuant to this section the average weekly wage cannot fairly and justly be
56 determined by the formulas provided in subsections 1 to 3 of this section, the division or the
57 commission may determine the average weekly wage in such manner and by such method as,
58 in the opinion of the division or the commission, based upon the exceptional facts presented,
59 fairly determine such employee's average weekly wage.
60 5. In computing the compensation to be paid to an employee, who, before the injury
61 for which the employee claims compensation, was disabled and drawing compensation under

63 apportioned according to the proportion of incapacity and disability caused by the respective
64 injuries which the employee may have suffered.
65 6. For purposes of establishing a rate of compensation applicable only to permanent
66 partial disability, permanent total disability and death benefits, pursuant to this chapter, the
67 average weekly wage for an employee who is under the age of twenty-one years shall be
68 adjusted to take into consideration the increased earning power of such employee until she or
69 he attains the age of twenty-one years and the average weekly wage for an employee who is

84 9. The parties, by agreement and with approval of an administrative law judge, legal
85 advisor or the commission, may enter into a compromise lump sum settlement in either
86 permanent total or permanent partial disability cases which prorates the lump sum settlement
87 over the life expectancy of the injured worker. When such an agreement has been approved,
