compulsory school attendance.
Be it enacted by the General Assembly of the State of Missouri, as follows:
1 Section A. Section 167.031, RSMo, is repealed and one new
2 section enacted in lieu thereof, to be known as section 167.031,
3 to read as follows:
1 167.031. 1. Every parent, guardian or other person in
2 this state having charge, control or custody of a child not
3 enrolled in a public, private, parochial, parish school or

5 schools and between the ages of seven years and the
6 compulsory attendance age for the district is responsible
7 for enrolling the child in a program of academic instruction
8 which complies with subsection 2 of this section. Any

10 the ages of five and seven years in a public school program
11 of academic instruction shall cause such child to attend the
12 academic program on a regular basis, according to this
13 section. Nonattendance by such child shall cause such
14 parent, guardian or other responsible person to be in
15 violation of the provisions of section 167.061, except as
16 provided by this section. A parent, guardian or other person
17 in this state having charge, control, or custody of a child

38 action; [or]
39 (3) A child between five and seven years of age shall
