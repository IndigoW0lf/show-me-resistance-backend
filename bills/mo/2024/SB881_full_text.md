AN ACT
To amend chapter 210, RSMo, by adding thereto one new section relating to child care.
Be it enacted by the General Assembly of the State of Missouri, as follows:
1 Section A. Chapter 210, RSMo, is amended by adding thereto
2 one new section, to be known as section 210.054, to read as
3 follows:
1 210.054. 1. Subject to appropriation, the office of
2 childhood within the department of elementary and secondary
3 education, in collaboration with the department of economic
4 development, shall design, implement, and administer a pilot
5 program to facilitate access to child care for working
6 families, which shall include a cost-sharing child care
7 subsidy program designed to divide the cost of child care
8 equally by participating employers, employees, and the state.
9 2. The pilot project shall use regional early child
10 care community leaders designated by the office to
11 coordinate with employers and child care providers to
12 provide for child care placement for employees of partnering
13 employers. The pilot program shall be established in at
14 least one predominately rural region and one predominately
15 urban region of the state.
16 3. Participating child care providers shall be
17 qualified to provide child care services pursuant to section
18 210.1080 and shall enter into an agreement with the office
19 to provide child care services to employees participating in
SB 881 2
20 the program. Such agreement shall specify the cost of child
21 care services for the employee for the duration of the
22 contract period, as well as the respective employer,
23 employee, and state shares of the costs; provided that such
24 shares are equal parts of the cost of the child care.
25 4. In order to qualify for the program, employees
26 shall work in Missouri for a participating employer and
27 shall have an income between greater than two hundred
28 percent but less than or equal to three hundred twenty-five
29 percent of the federal poverty level for the applicable
30 family size.
31 5. In addition to appropriations from the general
32 assembly, the office shall apply for available grants and
33 shall be able to accept other gifts, grants, bequests, and
34 donations to develop and implement the program established
35 pursuant to this section.
36 6. The office shall provide a report to the governor
37 and general assembly by December thirty-first each year
38 detailing the effectiveness of the pilot program in
39 increasing access to child care for Missouri employees and
40 encouraging recruitment and retention of employees of
41 participating employers.
42 7. The office shall promulgate rules and regulations
43 to implement the provisions of this section, including, but
44 not limited to, standardized agreements between employers,
45 employees, and the state for the payment of child care
46 services under this section; eligibility verification
47 processes for employees; and procedures for issuing the
48 state share of an employee's child care costs as a subsidy
49 to the provider. Any rule or portion of a rule, as that
50 term is defined in section 536.010, that is created under
51 the authority delegated in this section shall become
SB 881 3
52 effective only if it complies with and is subject to all of
53 the provisions of chapter 536 and, if applicable, section
54 536.028. This section and chapter 536 are nonseverable and
55 if any of the powers vested with the general assembly
56 pursuant to chapter 536 to review, to delay the effective
57 date, or to disapprove and annul a rule are subsequently
58 held unconstitutional, then the grant of rulemaking
59 authority and any rule proposed or adopted after August 28,
60 2024, shall be invalid and void.
61 8. Pursuant to section 23.253 of the Missouri Sunset
62 Act:
63 (1) The program authorized pursuant to this section
64 shall automatically sunset six years after August 28, 2024,
65 unless reauthorized by an act of the general assembly; and
66 (2) If such program is reauthorized, the program
67 authorized pursuant to this section shall automatically
68 sunset twelve years after the effective date of the
69 reauthorization; and
70 (3) This section shall terminate on September first of
71 the calendar year immediately following the calendar year in
72 which the program authorized pursuant to this section is
73 sunset.
