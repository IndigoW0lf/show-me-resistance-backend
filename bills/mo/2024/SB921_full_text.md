SECOND REGULAR SESSION
SENATE BILL NO. 921
102ND GENERA L ASSEMBLY
INTRODUCED BY SENATOR KOENIG.
4023S.02I KRISTINA MARTIN, Secretary
AN ACT
To repeal section 161.670, RSMo, and to enact in lieu thereof one new section relating to the
virtual school program.
Be it enacted by the General Assembly of the State of Missouri, as follows:
1 Section A. Section 161.670, RSMo, is repealed and one new
2 section enacted in lieu thereof, to be known as section 161.670,
3 to read as follows:
1 161.670. 1. Notwithstanding any other law, prior to
2 July 1, 2007, the state board of education shall establish
3 the "Missouri Course Access and Virtual School Program" to
4 serve school-age students residing in the state. The
5 Missouri course access and virtual school program shall
6 offer nonclassroom-based instruction in a virtual setting
7 using technology, intranet, or internet methods of
8 communication. Any student under the age of twenty-one in
9 grades kindergarten through twelve who resides in this state
10 shall be eligible to enroll in the Missouri course access
11 and virtual school program pursuant to subsection 3 of this
12 section.
13 2. (1) For purposes of calculation and distribution
14 of state school aid, students enrolled in the Missouri
15 course access and virtual school program shall be included
16 in the student enrollment of the school district in which
17 the student is enrolled under the relevant provisions of
18 subsection 3 of this section[; provided that any such] for
EXPLANATION-Matter enclosed in bold-faced brackets [thus] in this bill is not enacted
and is intended to be omitted in the law.
SB 921 2
19 such enrollment. Student attendance for full-time virtual
20 program students shall only be included in any district
21 pupil attendance calculation under chapter 163 and any
22 charter school pupil attendance calculation under section
23 160.415, using current-year pupil attendance for such full-
24 time virtual program pupils[; and further provided that].
25 The average daily attendance of a full-time virtual student
26 who is engaged in required instructional activities under
27 subsection 4 of this section shall be calculated as if the
28 pupil's attendance percentage equaled the host district's or
29 charter school's prior-year average attendance percentage,
30 and the provisions of section 162.1250 shall not apply to
31 such funding calculation. In the case of a host school
32 district enrolling one or more full-time virtual school
33 students, such enrolling district shall, as part of its
34 monthly state allocation, receive no less under the state
35 aid calculation for such students than an amount equal to
36 the state adequacy target multiplied by the weighted average
37 daily attendance of such full-time students. Students
38 residing in Missouri and enrolled in a full-time virtual
39 school program operated by a public institution of higher
40 education in this state shall be counted for a state aid
41 calculation by the department, and the department shall pay,
42 from funds dedicated to state school aid payments made under
43 section 163.031, to such institution an amount equal to the
44 state adequacy target multiplied by the weighted average
45 daily attendance of such full-time students.
46 (2) The Missouri course access and virtual school
47 program shall report to the district of residence the
48 following information about each student served by the
49 Missouri course access and virtual school program: name,
50 address, eligibility for free or reduced-price lunch,
SB 921 3
51 limited English proficiency status, special education needs,
52 and the number of courses in which the student is enrolled.
53 The Missouri course access and virtual school program shall
54 promptly notify the resident district when a student
55 discontinues enrollment. A "full-time equivalent student"
56 is a student who is enrolled in the instructional equivalent
57 of six credits per regular term. Each Missouri course
58 access and virtual school program course shall count as one
59 class and shall generate that portion of a full-time
60 equivalent that a comparable course offered by the school
61 district would generate.
62 (3) Pursuant to an education services plan and
63 collaborative agreement under subsection 3 of this section,
64 full-time equivalent students may be allowed to use a
65 physical location of the resident school district for all or
66 some portion of ongoing instructional activity, and the
67 enrollment plan shall provide for reimbursement of costs of
68 the resident district for providing such access pursuant to
69 rules promulgated under this section by the department.
70 (4) In no case shall more than the full-time
71 equivalency of a regular term of attendance for a single
72 student be used to claim state aid. Full-time equivalent
73 student credit completed shall be reported to the department
74 of elementary and secondary education in the manner
75 prescribed by the department. Nothing in this section shall
76 prohibit students from enrolling in additional courses under
77 a separate agreement that includes terms for paying tuition
78 or course fees.
79 (5) A full-time virtual school program serving full-
80 time equivalent students shall be considered an attendance
81 center in the host school district and shall participate in
82 the statewide assessment system as defined in section
SB 921 4
83 160.518. The academic performance of students enrolled in a
84 full-time virtual school program shall be assigned to the
85 designated attendance center of the full-time virtual school
86 program and shall be considered in like manner to other
87 attendance centers. The academic performance of any student
88 who disenrolls from a full-time virtual school program and
89 enrolls in a public school or charter school shall not be
90 used in determining the annual performance report score of
91 the attendance center or school district in which the
92 student enrolls for twelve months from the date of
93 enrollment.
94 (6) For the purposes of this section, a public
95 institution of higher education operating a full-time
96 virtual school program shall be subject to all requirements
97 applicable to a host school district with respect to its
98 full-time equivalent students.
99 3. (1) A student who resides in this state may enroll
100 in Missouri course access and virtual school program courses
101 of his or her choice as a part of the student's annual
102 course load each school year, with any costs associated with
103 such course or courses to be paid by the school district or
104 charter school if:
105 (a) The student is enrolled full-time in a public
106 school, including any charter school; and
107 (b) Prior to enrolling in any Missouri course access
108 and virtual school program course, a student has received
109 approval from his or her school district or charter school
110 through the procedure described under subdivision (2) of
111 this subsection.
112 (2) Each school district or charter school shall adopt
113 a policy that delineates the process by which a student may
114 enroll in courses provided by the Missouri course access and
SB 921 5
115 virtual school program that is substantially similar to the
116 typical process by which a district student would enroll in
117 courses offered by the school district and a charter school
118 student would enroll in courses offered by the charter
119 school. The policy may include consultation with the
120 school's counselor and may include parental notification or
121 authorization. The policy shall ensure that available
122 opportunities for in-person instruction are considered prior
123 to moving a student to virtual courses. The policy shall
124 allow for continuous enrollment throughout the school year.
125 If the school district or charter school disapproves a
126 student's request to enroll in a course or courses provided
127 by the Missouri course access and virtual school program,
128 the reason shall be provided in writing and it shall be for
129 good cause. Good cause justification to disapprove a
130 student's request for enrollment in a course shall be a
131 determination that doing so is not in the best educational
132 interest of the student, and shall be consistent with the
133 determination that would be made for such course request
134 under the process by which a district student would enroll
135 in a similar course offered by the school district and a
136 charter school student would enroll in a similar course
137 offered by the charter school, except that the determination
138 may consider the suitability of virtual courses for the
139 student based on prior participation in virtual courses by
140 the student. Appeals of any course denials under this
141 subsection shall be considered under a policy that is
142 substantially similar to the typical process by which
143 appeals would be considered for a student seeking to enroll
144 in courses offered by the school district and a charter
145 school student seeking to enroll in courses offered by the
146 charter school.
SB 921 6
147 (3) For students enrolled in any Missouri course
148 access and virtual school program course in which costs
149 associated with such course are to be paid by the school
150 district or charter school as described under this
151 subdivision, the school district or charter school shall pay
152 the content provider directly on a pro rata monthly basis
153 based on a student's completion of assignments and
154 assessments. If a student discontinues enrollment, the
155 district or charter school may stop making monthly payments
156 to the content provider. No school district or charter
157 school shall pay, for any one course for a student, more
158 than the market necessary costs but in no case shall pay
159 more than fourteen percent of the state adequacy target, as
160 defined under section 163.011, as calculated at the end of
161 the most recent school year for any single, year-long course
162 and no more than seven percent of the state adequacy target
163 as described above for any single semester equivalent course.
164 (4) [For students enrolling in a full-time virtual
165 program, the department of elementary and secondary
166 education shall adopt a policy that delineates the process
167 by which] (a) A student who lives in this state may enroll
168 in a virtual program of their choice as provided in this
169 subdivision, and the provisions of subdivisions (1) to (3)
170 of this subsection shall not apply to such enrollment in a
171 full-time virtual program. Each host school district
172 operating a full-time virtual program under this section
173 shall adopt, operate and implement [the state] an enrollment
174 policy[, subject to] as specified by the provisions of this
175 subdivision. [The policy shall:
176 (a) Require the good faith collaboration of] The
177 student, the student's parent or guardian if the student is
SB 921 7
178 not considered homeless, the virtual program, the host
179 district, and the resident district[;
180 (b)] shall collaborate in good faith to implement the
181 enrollment policy regarding the student's enrollment, and
182 the resident school district and the host school district
183 may mutually agree that the resident district shall offer or
184 continue to offer services for the student under an
185 agreement that includes financial terms for reimbursement by
186 the host school district for the necessary costs of the
187 resident school district providing such services. An
188 enrollment policy specified under this subsection shall:
189 a. Require a student's parent or guardian, if the
190 student is not considered homeless, to apply for enrollment
191 in a full time virtual program directly with the virtual
192 program;
193 b. Specify timelines for timely participation by the
194 virtual program, the host district, and resident district;
195 provided that the resident district shall provide any
196 relevant information and input on the enrollment within ten
197 business days of notice from the virtual program of the
198 enrollment application;
199 [(c)] c. Include a survey of the reasons for the
200 student's and parent's interests in participating in the
201 virtual program;
202 [(d)] d. Include consideration of available
203 opportunities for in-person instruction prior to enrolling a
204 student in a virtual program;
205 [(e)] e. Evaluate requests for enrollment based on
206 meeting the needs for a student to be successful considering
207 all relevant factors;
208 [(f)] f. Ensure that, for any enrolling student with a
209 covered disability, an individualized education [services
SB 921 8
210 plan and collaborative agreement is] program and a related
211 services agreement, in cases where such agreement is needed,
212 are created to provide all services required to ensure a
213 free and appropriate public education, including financial
214 terms for reimbursement by the host district for the
215 necessary costs of any virtual program, school district, or
216 public or private entity providing all or a portion of such
217 services;
218 [(g)] g. Require the virtual program to determine
219 whether an enrolling student will be admitted, based on the
220 enrollment policy, in consideration of all relevant factors
221 and provide the basis for its determination and any service
222 plan for the student, in writing, to the student, the
223 student's parent or guardian, the host district, and the
224 resident district; and
225 [(h)] h. Provide a process for reviewing appeals of
226 decisions made under this subdivision[; and].
227 [(i) Require] (b) The department [to] shall publish
228 an annual report based on the enrollments and enrollment
229 surveys conducted under this subdivision that provides data
230 at the statewide and district levels of sufficient detail to
231 allow analysis of trends regarding the reasons for
232 participation in the virtual program at the statewide and
233 district levels; provided that no such survey results will
234 be published in a manner that reveals individual student
235 information. The department shall also include, in the
236 annual report, data at the statewide and district levels of
237 sufficient detail to allow detection and analysis of the
238 racial, ethnic, and socio-economic balance of virtual
239 program participation among schools and districts at the
240 statewide and district levels, provided that no such survey
SB 921 9
241 results will be published in a manner that reveals
242 individual student information.
243 (5) In the case of a student who is a candidate for A+
244 tuition reimbursement and taking a virtual course under this
245 section, the school shall attribute no less than ninety-five
246 percent attendance to any such student who has completed
247 such virtual course.
248 (6) The Missouri course access and virtual school
249 program shall ensure that individual learning plans designed
250 by certified teachers and professional staff are developed
251 for all students enrolled in more than two full-time course
252 access program courses or a full-time virtual school.
253 (7) Virtual school programs shall monitor individual
254 student success and engagement of students enrolled in their
255 program[,] and, for students enrolled in virtual courses on
256 a part-time basis, the virtual school program shall provide
257 regular student progress reports for each student at least
258 four times per school year to the school district or charter
259 school, provide the host school district and the resident

266 education shall monitor the aggregate performance of
267 providers and make such information available to the public
268 under subsection 11 of this section.

270 department of elementary and secondary education, when a
271 student transfers into a school district or charter school,
272 credits previously gained through successful passage of
SB 921 10
273 approved courses under the Missouri course access and
274 virtual school program shall be accepted by the school
275 district or charter school.
276 (10) Pursuant to rules to be promulgated by the
277 department of elementary and secondary education, if a
278 student transfers into a school district or charter school
279 while enrolled in a Missouri course access and virtual
280 school program course or full-time virtual school, the
281 student shall continue to be enrolled in such course or
282 school.
283 (11) Nothing in this section shall prohibit home
284 school students, private school students, or students
285 wishing to take additional courses beyond their regular

292 any student unless required under the education services
293 plan created for an eligible student under subdivision (4)
294 of this subsection or for an eligible student with a
295 disability to comply with federal law. An education
296 services plan may require an eligible student to have access
297 to school facilities of the resident school district during
298 regular school hours for participation and instructional
299 activities of a virtual program under this section, and the
300 education services plan shall provide for reimbursement of

308 program. Unless immediate action is necessary, prior to
309 revocation or suspension, the department shall notify the
310 provider and give the provider a reasonable time period to
311 take corrective action to avoid revocation or suspension.
312 The process shall provide for periodic renewal of
313 authorization no less frequently than once every three years.
314 (14) Courses approved as of August 28, 2018, by the
315 department to participate in the Missouri virtual

319 (15) Any online course or virtual program offered by a
320 school district or charter school, including those offered
321 prior to August 28, 2018, which meets the requirements of

349 (3) Each full-time virtual school shall develop,
350 adopt, and post on the school's website a policy setting
351 forth the consequences for a student who fails to complete
352 the required instructional activities. Such policy shall
353 state, at a minimum, that if a student fails to complete the
354 instructional activities after receiving a notification
355 under subdivision (2) of this subsection, and after
356 reasonable intervention strategies have been implemented,
357 that the student shall be subject to certain consequences
358 which may include disenrollment from the school. Prior to
359 any disenrollment, the parent or guardian shall have the
360 opportunity to present any information that the parent deems
361 relevant, and such information shall be considered prior to
362 any final decision.
363 (4) If a full-time virtual school disenrolls a student
364 under subdivision (3) of this subsection, the school shall

411 established under this section, including any deadlines and
412 any guidelines applicable to the submission and
413 authorization process for course or full-time virtual school
414 providers on its website.
415 8. If the department determines that there are
416 insufficient funds available for evaluating and authorizing
417 course or full-time virtual school providers, the department
418 may charge applicant course or full-time virtual school
419 providers a fee up to, but no greater than, the amount of
420 the costs in order to ensure that evaluation occurs. The
421 department shall establish and publish a fee schedule for
422 purposes of this subsection.
423 9. Except as specified in this section and as may be
424 specified by rule of the state board of education, the
425 Missouri course access and virtual school program shall
