293 from the date of receipt by the commission. Such requests
294 and advisory opinions, deleting the name and identity of the
295 requesting person, shall be compiled and published by the
296 commission on at least an annual basis. Advisory opinions
297 issued by the commission shall be maintained and made

299 the commission during normal business hours. Any advisory
300 opinion or portion of an advisory opinion rendered pursuant
301 to this subsection shall be withdrawn by the commission if,
302 after hearing thereon, the joint committee on administrative
SB 854 11
303 rules finds that such advisory opinion is beyond or contrary
304 to the statutory authority of the commission or is
305 inconsistent with the legislative intent of any law enacted
306 by the general assembly, and after the general assembly, by
307 concurrent resolution, votes to adopt the findings and
308 conclusions of the joint committee on administrative rules.
309 Any such concurrent resolution adopted by the general
310 assembly shall be published at length by the commission in
311 its publication of advisory opinions of the commission next
312 following the adoption of such resolution, and a copy of
313 such concurrent resolution shall be maintained by the
314 commission, along with the withdrawn advisory opinion, in
315 its public file of advisory opinions. The commission shall
316 also send a copy of such resolution to the person who
317 originally requested the withdrawn advisory opinion. Any
318 advisory opinion issued by the ethics commission shall act
319 as legal direction to any person requesting such opinion and
320 no person shall be liable for relying on the opinion and it
321 shall act as a defense of justification against
322 prosecution. An advisory opinion of the commission shall
323 not be withdrawn unless:
324 (a) The authorizing statute is declared
325 unconstitutional;
326 (b) The opinion goes beyond the power authorized by
327 statute; or
328 (c) The authorizing statute is changed to invalidate
329 the opinion.

SB 854 12
335 upon any question of law regarding the effect or application
336 of sections 105.450 to 105.496, or chapter 130. Such
337 opinion need be in writing only upon request of such
338 official, member or director, and in any event shall be
339 rendered within sixty days that such request is delivered to
340 the attorney general.
341 17. The state auditor and the state auditor's duly
342 authorized employees who have taken the oath of
343 confidentiality required by section 29.070 may audit the
344 commission and in connection therewith may inspect materials
345 relating to the functions of the commission. Such audit
346 shall include a determination of whether appropriations were
347 spent within the intent of the general assembly, but shall
348 not extend to review of any file or document pertaining to
349 any particular investigation, audit or review by the
350 commission, an investigator or any staff or person employed
351 by the commission or under the supervision of the commission
352 or an investigator. The state auditor and any employee of
353 the state auditor shall not disclose the identity of any
354 person who is or was the subject of an investigation by the
355 commission and whose identity is not public information as
356 provided by law.
357 18. From time to time but no more frequently than
358 annually the commission may request the officials and
359 entities described in subdivision (6) of section 105.450 to
360 identify for the commission in writing those persons
361 associated with such office or entity which such office or
362 entity has designated as a decision-making public servant.
363 Each office or entity delineated in subdivision (6) of
364 section 105.450 receiving such a request shall identify
365 those so designated within thirty days of the commission's
366 request.
