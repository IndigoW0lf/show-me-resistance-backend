AN ACT
To repeal section 137.073, RSMo, and to enact in lieu thereof three new sections relating to
ballot language relating to taxation.
Be it enacted by the General Assembly of the state of Missouri, as follows:
SectionA. Section137.073,RSMo,isrepealedandthreenewsectionsenactedinlieu
2 thereof, to be known as sections 115.240, 137.067, and 137.073, to read as follows:
115.240. The election authority for any political subdivision or special district
2 shall label ballot measures relating to taxation that are submitted by such political
3 subdivisionor specialdistrict toa voteofthepeople numerically oralphabeticallyin the
4 order in which they are submitted. No such ballot measure shall be labeled in a
5 descriptive manner aside from its numerical or alphabetical designation. Election
6 authorities may coordinate with each other, or with the secretary of state, to maintain a
7 database or other record to facilitate numerical or alphabetical assignment.
137.067. Notwithstanding any provision of law to the contrary, any ballot
2 measure seeking approval to add, change, or modify a tax on real property shall express
3 the effect of the proposed change within the ballot language in terms of the change in
4 real dollars owed per one hundred thousand dollars of a property's market valuation.
137.073. 1. As used in this section, the following terms mean:
2 (1) "General reassessment", changes in value, entered in the assessor's books, of a
3 substantial portion of the parcels of real property within a county resulting wholly or partly
4 from reappraisal of value or other actions of the assessor or county equalization body or
5 ordered by the state tax commission or any court;
EXPLANATION — Matter enclosed in bold-faced brackets [thus] in the above bill is not enacted and is
intended to be omitted from the law. Matter in bold-face type in the above bill is proposed language.
HB 1517 2
6 (2) "Tax rate", "rate", or "rate of levy", singular or plural, includes the tax rate for
7 each purpose of taxation of property a taxing authority is authorized to levy without a vote
8 and any tax rate authorized by election, including bond interest and sinking fund;
9 (3) "Tax rate ceiling", a tax rate as revised by the taxing authority to comply with the
10 provisions of this section or when a court has determined the tax rate; except that, other
11 provisions of law to the contrary notwithstanding, a school district may levy the operating
12 levy for school purposes required for the current year pursuant to subsection 2 of section
13 163.021, less all adjustments required pursuant to Article X, Section 22 of the Missouri
14 Constitution, if such tax rate does not exceed the highest tax rate in effect subsequent to the
15 1980 tax year. This is the maximum tax rate that may be levied, unless a higher tax rate
16 ceiling is approved by voters of the political subdivision as provided in this section;
17 (4) "Taxrevenue",whenreferringtothepreviousyear,meanstheactualreceiptsfrom
18 ad valorem levies on all classes of property, including state-assessed property, in the
19 immediately preceding fiscal year of the political subdivision, plus an allowance for taxes
20 billed but not collected in the fiscal year and plus an additional allowance for the revenue
21 which would have been collected from property which was annexed by such political
22 subdivision but which was not previously used in determining tax revenue pursuant to this
23 section. The term "tax revenue" shall not include any receipts from ad valorem levies on any
24 property of a railroad corporation or a public utility, as these terms are defined in section
25 386.020, which were assessed by the assessor of a county or city in the previous year but are
26 assessed by the state tax commission in the current year. All school districts and those
27 counties levying sales taxes pursuant to chapter 67 shall include in the calculation of tax
28 revenue an amount equivalent to that by which they reduced property tax levies as a result of
29 sales tax pursuant to section 67.505 and section 164.013 or as excess home dock city or
30 county fees as provided in [subsection 4 of] section 313.820 in the immediately preceding
31 fiscal year but not including any amount calculated to adjust for prior years. For purposes of
32 political subdivisions which were authorized to levy a tax in the prior year but which did not
33 levy such tax or levied a reduced rate, the term "tax revenue", as used in relation to the
34 revision of tax levies mandated by law, shall mean the revenues equal to the amount that
35 would have been available if the voluntary rate reduction had not been made.
36 2. Whenever changes in assessedvaluation are entered in the assessor's books for any
37 personal property, in the aggregate, or for any subclass of real property as such subclasses are
38 established in Section 4(b) of Article X of the Missouri Constitution and defined in section
39 137.016, the county clerk in all counties and the assessor of St. Louis City shall notify each
40 political subdivision wholly or partially within the county or St. Louis City of the change in
41 valuation of each subclass of real property, individually, and personal property, in the
42 aggregate, exclusive of new construction and improvements. All political subdivisions shall
HB 1517 3
43 immediately revise the applicable rates of levy for each purpose for each subclass of real
44 property, individually, and personal property, in the aggregate, for which taxes are levied to
45 the extent necessary to produce from all taxable property, exclusive of new construction and
46 improvements, substantially the same amount of tax revenue as was produced in the previous
47 year for each subclass of real property, individually, and personal property, in the aggregate,
48 except that the rate shall not exceed the greater of the most recent voter-approved rate or the
49 most recent voter-approved rate as adjusted under subdivision (2) of subsection 5 of this
50 section. Any political subdivision that has received approval from voters for a tax increase
51 afterAugust27,2008,maylevyaratetocollectsubstantiallythesameamountoftaxrevenue
52 as the amount of revenue that would have been derived by applying the voter-approved
53 increased tax rate ceiling to the total assessed valuation of the political subdivision as most
54 recently certified by the city or county clerk on or before the date of the election in which
55 such increase is approved, increased by the percentage increase in the consumer price index,
56 as provided by law, except that the rate shall not exceed the greater of the most recent voter-
57 approved rate or the most recent voter-approved rate as adjusted under subdivision (2) of
58 subsection 5 of this section. Such tax revenue shall not include any receipts from ad valorem
59 levies on any real property which was assessed by the assessor of a county or city in such
60 previous year but is assessed by the assessor of a county or city in the current year in a
61 different subclass of real property. Where the taxing authority is a school district for the
62 purposes of revising the applicable rates of levy for each subclass of real property, the tax
63 revenues from state-assessed railroad and utility property shall be apportioned and attributed
64 toeach subclass ofrealpropertybased onthe percentage ofthe totalassessedvaluation ofthe
65 county that each subclass of real property represents in the current taxable year. As provided
66 inSection22ofArticleXoftheconstitution,apoliticalsubdivisionmayalsoreviseeachlevy
67 to allow for inflationary assessment growth occurring within the political subdivision. The
68 inflationary growth factor for any such subclass of real property or personal property shall be
69 limited to the actual assessment growth in such subclass or class, exclusive of new
70 construction and improvements, and exclusive of the assessed value on any real property
71 which was assessed by the assessor of a county or city in the current year in a different
72 subclass of real property, but not to exceed the consumer price index or five percent,
73 whichever is lower. Should the tax revenue of a political subdivision from the various tax
74 rates determined in this subsection be different than the tax revenue that would have been
75 determined from a single tax rate as calculated pursuant to the method of calculation in this
76 subsection prior to January 1, 2003, then the political subdivision shall revise the tax rates of
77 those subclasses of real property, individually, and/or personal property, in the aggregate, in
78 which there is a tax rate reduction, pursuant to the provisions of this subsection. Such
79 revision shall yield an amount equal to such difference and shall be apportioned among such
HB 1517 4
80 subclasses of real property, individually, and/or personal property, in the aggregate, based on
81 the relative assessed valuation of the class or subclasses of property experiencing a tax rate
82 reduction. Suchrevisioninthetaxratesofeachclassorsubclassshallbemadebycomputing
83 the percentage of current year adjusted assessed valuation of each class or subclass with a tax
84 rate reduction to the total current year adjusted assessed valuation of the class or subclasses
85 with a tax rate reduction, multiplying the resulting percentages by the revenue difference
86 between the single rate calculation and the calculations pursuant to this subsection and
87 dividingbytherespectiveadjustedcurrentyearassessedvaluationofeachclassorsubclassto
88 determine the adjustment to the rate to be levied upon each class or subclass of property. The
89 adjustment computed herein shall be multiplied by one hundred, rounded to four decimals in
90 the manner provided in this subsection, and added to the initial rate computed for each class
91 or subclass of property. For school districts that levy separate tax rates on each subclass of
92 real property and personal property in the aggregate, if voters approved a ballot before
93 January 1, 2011, that presented separate stated tax rates to be applied to the different
94 subclasses of real property and personal property in the aggregate, or increases the separate
95 rates that may be levied on the different subclasses of real property and personal property in
96 the aggregate by different amounts, the tax rate that shall be used for the single tax rate
97 calculationshallbeablendedrate,calculatedinthemannerprovidedundersubdivision(1)of
98 subsection6 of thissection. Notwithstandingany provision ofthis subsection tothe contrary,
99 no revision to the rate of levy for personal property shall cause such levy to increase over the
100 levy for personal property from the prior year.
101 3. (1) Where the taxing authority is a school district, it shall be required to revise the
102 rates of levy to the extent necessary to produce from all taxable property, including state-
103 assessed railroad and utility property, which shall be separately estimated in addition to other
104 data required in complying with section 164.011, substantially the amount of tax revenue
105 permitted in this section. In the year following tax rate reduction, the tax rate ceiling may be
106 adjusted to offset such district's reduction in the apportionment of state school moneys due to
107 itsreduced taxrate. However, inthe eventanyschool district,in calculatinga taxrateceiling
108 pursuant to this section, requiring the estimating of effects of state-assessed railroad and
109 utility valuation or loss of state aid, discovers that the estimates used result in receipt of
110 excess revenues, which would have required a lower rate if the actual information had been
111 known,theschooldistrictshallreducethetaxrateceilinginthefollowingyeartocompensate
112 forthe excess receipts,and the recalculatedrateshall become thetax rateceiling for purposes
113 of this section.
114 (2) For any political subdivision which experiences a reduction in the amount of
115 assessed valuation relating to a prior year, due to decisions of the state tax commission or a
HB 1517 5
116 court pursuant to sections 138.430 to 138.433, or due to clerical errors or corrections in the
117 calculation or recordation of any assessed valuation:
118 (a) Suchpoliticalsubdivisionmayrevisethetaxrateceilingforeachpurposeitlevies
119 taxes to compensate for the reduction in assessed value occurring after the political
120 subdivision calculated the tax rate ceiling for the particular subclass of real property or for
121 personal property, in the aggregate, in a prior year. Such revision by the political subdivision
122 shall be made at the time of the next calculation of the tax rate for the particular subclass of
123 real property or for personal property, in the aggregate, after the reduction in assessed
124 valuation has been determined and shall be calculated in a manner that results in the revised
125 taxrateceilingbeingthesameasitwouldhavebeenhadthecorrectedorfinalizedassessment
126 been available at the time of the prior calculation;
127 (b) In addition, for up to three years following the determination of the reduction in
128 assessed valuation as a result of circumstances defined in this subdivision, such political
129 subdivision may levy a tax rate for each purpose it levies taxes above the revised tax rate
130 ceiling provided in paragraph (a) of this subdivision to recoup any revenues it was entitled to
131 receive had the corrected or finalized assessment been available at the time of the prior
132 calculation.
133 4. (1) InordertoimplementtheprovisionsofthissectionandSection22ofArticleX
134 of the Constitution of Missouri, the term improvements shall apply to both real and personal
135 property. Inordertodeterminethevalueofnewconstructionandimprovements,eachcounty
136 assessor shall maintain a record of real property valuations in such a manner as to identify
137 each year the increase in valuation for each political subdivision in the county as a result of
138 new construction and improvements. The value of new construction and improvements shall
139 include the additional assessed value of all improvements or additions to real property which
140 were begun after and were not part of the prior year's assessment, except that the additional
141 assessed value of all improvements or additions to real property which had been totally or
142 partially exempt from ad valorem taxes pursuant to sections 99.800 to 99.865, sections
143 135.200 to 135.255, and section 353.110 shall be included in the value of new construction
144 and improvements when the property becomes totally or partially subject to assessment and
145 paymentofalladvaloremtaxes. Theaggregateincreaseinvaluationofpersonalpropertyfor
146 the current year over that of the previous year is the equivalent of the new construction and
147 improvements factor for personal property. Notwithstanding any opt-out implemented
148 pursuant to subsection 14 of section 137.115, the assessor shall certify the amount of new
149 construction and improvements and the amount of assessed value on any real property which
150 was assessed by the assessor of a county or city in such previous year but is assessed by the
151 assessor of a county or city in the current year in a different subclass of real property

153 county clerk in order that political subdivisions shall have this information for the purpose of
154 calculating tax rates pursuant to this section and Section 22, Article X, Constitution of
155 Missouri. In addition, the state tax commission shall certify each year to each county clerk
156 theincreaseinthegeneralpricelevelasmeasuredbytheConsumerPriceIndexforAllUrban
157 Consumers for the United States, or its successor publications, as defined and officially
158 reported by the United States Department of Labor, or its successor agency. The state tax
159 commission shall certify the increase in such index on the latest twelve-month basis available
160 on February first of each year over the immediately preceding prior twelve-month period in
161 order that political subdivisions shall have this information available in setting their tax rates
162 accordingtolawandSection22ofArticleXoftheConstitutionofMissouri. Forpurposesof
163 implementing the provisions of this section and Section 22 of Article X of the Missouri
164 Constitution, the term "property" means all taxable property, including state-assessed
165 property.
166 (2) Each political subdivision required to revise rates of levy pursuant to this section
167 or Section 22 of Article X of the Constitution of Missouri shall calculate each tax rate it is
168 authorized to levy and, in establishing each tax rate, shall consider each provision for tax rate
169 revision provided in this section and Section 22 of Article X of the Constitution of Missouri,
170 separately and without regard to annual tax rate reductions provided in section 67.505 and
171 section 164.013. Each political subdivision shall set each tax rate it is authorized to levy
172 using the calculation that produces the lowest tax rate ceiling. It is further the intent of the
173 general assembly, pursuant to the authority of Section 10(c) of Article X of the Constitution
174 of Missouri, that the provisions of such section be applicable to tax rate revisions mandated
175 pursuant to Section 22 of Article X of the Constitution of Missouri as to reestablishing tax
176 rates as revised in subsequent years, enforcement provisions, and other provisions not in
177 conflict with Section 22 of Article X of the Constitution of Missouri. Annual tax rate
178 reductions provided in section 67.505 and section 164.013 shall be applied to the tax rate as
179 established pursuant to this section and Section 22 of Article X of the Constitution of
180 Missouri, unless otherwise provided by law.
181 5. (1) In all political subdivisions, the tax rate ceiling established pursuant to this
182 sectionshallnotbeincreasedunlessapprovedbyavoteofthepeople. Approvalofthehigher
183 tax rate shall be by at least a majorityof votes cast. When a proposed higher tax rate requires
184 approval by more than a simple majority pursuant to any provision of law or the constitution,
185 the tax rate increase must receive approval by at least the majority required.
186 (2) When voters approve an increase in the tax rate, the amount of the increase shall
187 beaddedtothetaxrateceilingascalculatedpursuanttothissectiontotheextentthetotalrate
188 does not exceed any maximum rate prescribed by law. If a ballot question presents a stated
189 tax rate for approval rather than describing the amount of increase in the question, the stated
HB 1517 7
190 tax rate approved shall be adjusted as provided in this section and, so adjusted, shall be the
191 current tax rate ceiling. The increased tax rate ceiling as approved shall be adjusted such that
192 when applied to the current total assessed valuation of the political subdivision, excluding
193 new construction and improvements since the date of the election approving such increase,
194 the revenue derived from the adjusted tax rate ceiling is equal to the sum of: the amount of
195 revenue which would have been derived by applying the voter-approved increased tax rate
196 ceilingtototalassessedvaluationofthepoliticalsubdivision,asmostrecentlycertifiedbythe
197 city or county clerk on or before the date of the election in which such increase is approved,
198 increased by the percentage increase in the consumer price index, as provided by law. Such
199 adjusted tax rate ceiling may be applied to the total assessed valuation of the political
200 subdivisionatthesettingofthenexttaxrate. Ifaballotquestionpresentsaphased-intaxrate
201 increase, upon voter approval, each tax rate increase shall be adjusted in the manner
202 prescribedinthissectiontoyieldthesumof: theamountofrevenuethatwouldbederivedby
203 applying such voter-approved increased rate to the total assessed valuation, as most recently
204 certified by the city or county clerk on or before the date of the election in which such
205 increase was approved, increased by the percentage increase in the consumer price index, as
206 provided by law, from the date of the election to the time of such increase and, so adjusted,
207 shall be the current tax rate ceiling.
208 (3) The provisions of subdivision (2) of this subsection notwithstanding, if prior
209 to the expiration of a temporary levy increase, voters approve a subsequent levy
210 increase, the new tax rate ceiling shall remain in effect only until such time as the
211 temporary levy expires under the terms originally approved by a vote of the people, at
212 which time the tax rate ceiling shall be decreased by the amount of the temporary levy
213 increase. If, prior to the expiration of a temporary levy increase, voters of a political
214 subdivision are asked to approve an additional, permanent increase to the political
215 subdivision's tax rate ceiling, voters shall be submitted ballot language that clearly
216 indicates that if the permanent levy increase is approved, the temporary levy shall be
217 made permanent.
218 (4) Thegoverning bodyofany political subdivisionmaylevy a taxrate lower thanits
219 tax rate ceiling and may, in a nonreassessment year, increase that lowered tax rate to a level
220 not exceeding the tax rate ceiling without voter approval in the manner provided under
221 subdivision [(4)] (5) of this subsection. Nothing in this section shall be construed as
222 prohibiting a political subdivision from voluntarily levying a tax rate lower than that which is
223 required under the provisions of this section or from seeking voter approval of a reduction to
224 such political subdivision's tax rate ceiling.
225 [(4)] (5) In a year of general reassessment, a governing body whose tax rate is lower
226 than its tax rate ceiling shall revise its tax rate pursuant to the provisions of subsection 4 of
HB 1517 8
227 this section as if its tax rate was at the tax rate ceiling. In a year following general
228 reassessment,if such governingbody intendsto increaseits tax rate,the governingbodyshall
229 conduct a public hearing, and in a public meeting it shall adopt an ordinance, resolution, or
230 policystatementjustifyingitsactionpriortosettingandcertifyingitstaxrate. Theprovisions
231 of this subdivision shall not apply to any political subdivision which levies a tax rate lower
232 than its tax rate ceiling solely due to a reduction required by law resulting from sales tax
233 collections. The provisions of this subdivision shall not apply to any political subdivision
234 which has received voter approval for an increase to its tax rate ceiling subsequent to setting
235 its most recent tax rate.
236 (6) (a) As used in this subdivision, the following terms mean:
237 a. "Current tax rate ceiling", the tax rate ceiling in effect before the voters
238 approved a higher tax rate in a 2023 election;
239 b. "Increased tax rate ceiling", the new tax rate ceiling in effect after the voters
240 approved a higher tax rate in a 2023 election.
241 (b) Notwithstanding any other provision of law to the contrary, for the general
242 reassessment performed in 2023, when the required majority of voters in a school
243 district serving a census-designated place with more than twenty-seven thousand but
244 fewer than thirty thousand inhabitants and located in a county with more than one
245 million inhabitants passes an increase in the school district's tax rate, the school district
246 shall use the current tax rate ceiling and the increase approved by the voters in
247 establishing the rates of levy for the tax year immediately following the election.
248 (c) If the assessed valuation of real property in such school district is reduced in
249 such tax year immediately following the election, such school district may raise its rates
250 of levy so that the revenue received from its local real property tax rates equals the
251 amount the school district would have received from the increased rates of levy had
252 there been no reduction in the assessed valuation of real property in the school district.
253 (d) Using the increased tax rate ceiling shall be revenue neutral as required in
254 Article X, Section 22 of the Constitution of Missouri.
255 6. (1) For the purposes of calculating state aid for public schools pursuant to section
256 163.031, each taxing authority which is a school district shall determine its proposed tax rate
257 as a blended rate of the classes or subclasses of property. Such blended rate shall be
258 calculated by first determining the total tax revenue of the property within the jurisdiction of
259 the taxing authority, which amount shall be equal to the sum of the products of multiplying
260 theassessedvaluationofeachclass andsubclassofpropertybythecorresponding taxratefor
261 such class or subclass, then dividing the total tax revenue by the total assessed valuation of
262 the same jurisdiction, and then multiplying the resulting quotient by a factor of one hundred.
263 Where the taxing authority is a school district, such blended rate shall also be used by such
HB 1517 9
264 school district for calculating revenue from state-assessed railroad and utility property as
265 defined in chapter 151 and for apportioning the tax rate by purpose.
266 (2) Eachtaxingauthorityproposingtolevyataxrateinanyyearshallnotifytheclerk

287 of receipt, forward a copy of the notice of a taxing authority's tax rate ceiling and proposed
288 tax rate and any substantiating data to the state auditor. The state auditor shall, within fifteen
289 days of the date of receipt, examine such information and return to the county clerk his or her

302 rejects a rate change certified by the state auditor and the state auditor does not receive
303 supporting information which justifies the taxing authority's original or any subsequent
304 proposed tax rate, then the state auditor shall refer the perceived violations of such taxing
305 authority to the attorney general's office and the attorney general is authorized to obtain
306 injunctive relief to prevent the taxing authority from levying a violative tax rate.
307 (3) In the event that the taxing authority incorrectly completes the forms created and
308 promulgated under subdivision (2) of this subsection, or makes a clerical error, the taxing
309 authority may submit amended forms with an explanation for the needed changes. If such
310 amended forms are filed under regulations prescribed by the state auditor, the state auditor
311 shall take into consideration such amended forms for the purposes of this subsection.
312 7. Notaxrateshallbeextendedonthetaxrollsbythecountyclerkunlessthepolitical
313 subdivision has complied with the foregoing provisions of this section.
314 8. Whenever a taxpayer has cause to believe that a taxing authority has not complied
315 with the provisions of this section, the taxpayer may make a formal complaint with the
316 prosecuting attorney of the county. Where the prosecuting attorney fails to bring an action
317 withintendaysofthefilingofthecomplaint,thetaxpayermaybringacivilactionpursuantto
318 this section and institute an action as representative of a class of all taxpayers within a taxing
319 authority if the class is so numerous that joinder of all members is impracticable, if there are
320 questions of law or fact common to the class, if the claims or defenses of the representative
321 parties are typical of the claims or defenses of the class, and if the representative parties will
322 fairly and adequately protect the interests of the class. In any class action maintained
323 pursuant to this section, the court may direct to the members of the class a notice to be
324 published at least once each week for four consecutive weeks in a newspaper of general
325 circulation published in the county where the civil action is commenced and in other counties
326 within the jurisdiction of a taxing authority. The notice shall advise each member that the
327 court will exclude him or her from the class if he or she so requests by a specified date, that
328 the judgment, whether favorable or not, will include all members who do not request
329 exclusion, and that any member who does not request exclusion may, if he or she desires,
330 enter an appearance. In any class action brought pursuant to this section, the court, in
331 addition to the relief requested, shall assess against the taxing authority found to be in
332 violation of this section the reasonable costs of bringing the action, including reasonable
