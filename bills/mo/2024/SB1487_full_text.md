9 including, but not limited to, the bond, the license holder
10 of the mechanical contractor shall be allowed to provide
11 services in the political subdivision;
12 (3) Pass:
13 (a) A standardized mechanical assessment test
14 nationally offered by:
15 a. The International Code Council (ICC);

21 independent professional testing agency not affiliated with

23 by the division;
24 (4) Pay for all costs associated with the tests

33 experience directing and supervising at least one field
34 employee.
35 2. Any applicant for licensure who holds a local
36 license or other license authorizing him or her to engage in
37 mechanical contracting, who has seven thousand five hundred
38 hours of verifiable field experience in mechanical
39 contracting work, and who is otherwise eligible for
40 licensure shall be issued a statewide mechanical contractor
41 license. The provisions of this subsection shall apply only
42 to licenses issued by a political subdivision with the legal
43 authority to issue such licenses.
44 3. If a corporation, firm, institution, organization,
45 company, or representative thereof desires to engage in
46 mechanical contracting under sections 324.950 to 324.983, it
47 shall have in its employ at least one statewide license
48 holder in accordance with sections 324.950 to 324.983. A
49 statewide mechanical contractor license holder shall
50 represent only one corporation, firm, institution,
51 organization, or company at one time. A mechanical
52 contractor shall have one license holder responsible for
53 offering to field employees based in this state eight
54 contact hours of industry training per year, and such
55 mechanical contractor shall be responsible for providing
56 proof of training to the division upon request. In the
57 event of a loss of a license holder, a mechanical contractor
58 shall remain in good standing with the division for six
59 months after notifying the division of the change in
SB 1487 7
60 status. Within the six-month period, a new license holder
61 shall be registered with the division. If no license holder
62 is registered within such six-month period, the division
63 shall declare the mechanical contractor inactive.
64 4. The division may issue a statewide mechanical
65 contractor license to any person who holds a current and
66 active license to engage in the practice of a mechanical
67 contractor or as a master pipefitter or master plumber
68 issued by any other state, the District of Columbia, or any
69 territory of the United States that requires standards for
70 licensure, registration, or certification considered to be
71 equivalent or more stringent than the requirements for
72 licensure under sections 324.950 to 324.983.
73 5. Where the contact information of a mechanical
74 contractor's employees is required to fulfill the
75 obligations of a license, such contact information shall be
76 considered a trade secret and therefore not a public record
77 under chapter 610.
1 324.962. 1. A political subdivision shall not be
2 prohibited from establishing a local mechanical contractor's
3 license but shall recognize a statewide license in lieu of a
4 local license for the purpose of performing contracting work
5 or obtaining permits to perform work within such political
6 subdivision. No political subdivision shall require the
7 employees of a statewide licensed mechanical contractor, or
8 its subcontractors' or manufacturers' representatives, to
9 obtain journeyman licenses, apprentice licenses, or
10 occupation licenses that require passing any examination or
11 any special requirements to assess proficiency or mastery of
12 the mechanical trade. The workforce of a statewide licensee
13 shall be deemed eligible to perform mechanical contracting
SB 1487 8
14 work and to obtain permits to perform such work from any
15 political subdivision within this state.
16 2. If a political subdivision does not recognize a
17 statewide license in lieu of a local license for the purpose
18 of performing contracting work or obtaining permits to
19 perform work within the political subdivision, a statewide
20 mechanical contractor licensee may file a complaint with the
21 division. The division shall perform an investigation into
22 the complaint, and if the division finds that the political
23 subdivision failed to recognize a statewide license in
24 accordance with this section, the division shall notify the
25 political subdivision that the political subdivision has
26 violated the provisions of this section and has thirty days
27 to comply with this section. If after thirty days the
28 political subdivision still does not recognize a statewide
29 license, the division shall notify the director of the
30 department of revenue, who shall withhold any moneys the
31 noncompliant political subdivision would otherwise be
32 entitled to from local sales tax, as defined in section
33 32.085, until the director has received notice from the
34 division that the political subdivision is in compliance
35 with this section. Upon the political subdivision coming
36 into compliance with the provisions of this section, the
37 division shall notify the director of the department of
38 revenue, who shall disburse all funds held under this
39 subsection. Moneys held by the director of the department
40 of revenue under this subsection shall not be deemed to be
41 state funds and shall not be commingled with any funds of
42 the state.
43 3. The provisions of this section shall not prohibit
44 any political subdivision in this state from:
SB 1487 9
45 (1) Enforcing any technical code or law contained in
46 this section;
47 (2) Requiring a business license to perform mechanical
48 contracting work;
49 (3) Issuing mechanical contracting permits;
50 (4) Enforcing technical codes of the political
51 subdivision; or
52 (5) Inspecting the work of a statewide mechanical
53 contractor.
54 4. Political subdivisions that do not have the
55 authority to issue or require mechanical contractor licenses
56 prior to August 28, 2024, shall not be granted such
57 authority under the provisions of this section.
1 324.965. There is hereby created in the state treasury
2 the "Missouri Mechanical Contractor Licensing Fund", which
3 shall consist of moneys collected under sections 324.950 to
4 324.983. The state treasurer shall be custodian of the fund
5 and may approve disbursements from the fund in accordance
6 with sections 30.170 and 30.180. Upon appropriation, moneys
7 in the fund shall be used solely for the administration of
8 sections 324.950 to 324.983. The provisions of section
9 33.080 to the contrary notwithstanding, moneys in this fund
10 shall not be transferred and placed to the credit of general
11 revenue until the amount in the fund at the end of the
12 biennium exceeds three times the amount of the appropriation
13 from the fund for the preceding fiscal year. The amount, if
14 any, in the fund that shall lapse is that amount in the fund
15 that exceeds the appropriate multiple of the appropriations
16 from the fund for the preceding fiscal year. The state
17 treasurer shall invest moneys in the fund in the same manner
18 as other funds are invested. Any interest and moneys earned
19 on such investments shall be credited to the fund.
SB 1487 10
1 324.968. 1. Licenses shall expire on a renewal date
2 established by the division. The term of licensure shall be
3 twenty-four months. The division shall mail a renewal
4 notice to the last known address of each person licensed
5 under sections 324.950 to 324.983 prior to the renewal
6 date. Failure to provide the division with the information
7 required for renewal or to pay the required fee after such
8 notice shall result in the license being declared inactive.
9 The licensee shall not practice until he or she applies for
10 reinstatement and pays the required fees. The license shall
11 be restored if the application for reinstatement is received
12 within two years of the renewal date.
13 2. In addition to other requirements provided by
14 sections 324.950 to 324.983 and established by the division,
15 in order to renew such license under this section, the
16 person shall have at least sixteen contact hours of industry-
17 related training.
1 324.971. Any person operating as a mechanical
2 contractor in a political subdivision that does not require
3 the mechanical contractor to hold a local license, or who
4 operates as a mechanical contractor in a political
5 subdivision that requires a local license possessed by that
6 person, shall not be required to possess a statewide license
7 under sections 324.950 to 324.983 to operate as a mechanical
8 contractor in such political subdivision.
1 324.977. The statewide mechanical contractor license
