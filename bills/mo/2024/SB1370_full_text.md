77 2. A treatment court division shall be established,
78 prior to August 28, 2021, by any circuit court pursuant to

89 the court, a treatment court making a referral for substance
90 use disorder or mental health disorder treatment, when such
91 program will receive state or federal funds in connection
92 with such referral, shall refer the person only to a program
93 which is certified by the department of mental health,
94 unless no appropriate certified treatment program is located
95 within the same county as the treatment court. Upon
96 successful completion of the treatment court program, the
97 charges, petition, or penalty against a treatment court
98 participant may be dismissed, reduced, or modified, unless
99 otherwise stated. Any fees received by a court from a
100 defendant as payment for substance or mental health
101 treatment programs shall not be considered court costs,
102 charges or fines.
103 3. An adult treatment court may be established by any
104 circuit court [under sections 478.001 to 478.009] to provide
105 an alternative for the judicial system to dispose of cases
106 which stem from substance use.
107 4. [Under sections 478.001 to 478.009,] A DWI court
108 may be established by any circuit court to provide an
109 alternative for the judicial system to dispose of cases that
110 stem from driving while intoxicated.
111 5. A family treatment court may be established by any
112 circuit court. The juvenile division of the circuit court
113 or the family court, if one is established under section
SB 1370 5
114 487.010, may refer one or more parents or other household
115 members subject to its jurisdiction to the family treatment
116 court if he or she has been determined to have a substance
117 use disorder or co-occurring disorder that impacts the
118 safety and well-being of the children in the family.
119 6. A juvenile treatment court may be established by
120 the juvenile division of any circuit court. The juvenile
121 division may refer a juvenile to the juvenile treatment
122 court if the juvenile is determined to have committed acts
123 that violate the criminal laws of the state or ordinances of
124 a municipality or county and a substance use disorder or co-
125 occurring disorder contributed to the commission of the
126 offense.
127 7. The general assembly finds and declares that it is
128 the public policy of this state to encourage and provide an
129 alternative method for the disposal of cases for military
130 veterans and current military personnel with substance use
131 disorders, mental health disorders, or co-occurring
132 disorders. In order to effectuate this public policy, a
133 veterans treatment court may be established by any circuit
134 court, or combination of circuit courts upon agreement of
135 the presiding judges of such circuit courts, to provide an
136 alternative for the judicial system to dispose of cases that
137 stem from a substance use disorder, mental health disorder,
138 or co-occurring disorder of military veterans or current
139 military personnel. A veterans treatment court shall
140 combine judicial supervision, drug or alcohol testing, and
141 substance use and mental health disorder treatment to
142 participants who have served or are currently serving the
143 United States Armed Forces, including members of the
144 Reserves or National Guard, with preference given to
145 individuals who have combat service. For the purposes of
SB 1370 6
146 this section, combat service shall be shown through military
147 service documentation that reflects service in a combat
148 theater, receipt of combat service medals, or receipt of
149 imminent danger or hostile fire pay or tax benefits. Except
150 for good cause found by the court, a veterans treatment
151 court shall make a referral for substance use or mental
152 health disorder treatment, or a combination of substance use
153 and mental health disorder treatment, through the Department
154 of Defense health care, the Veterans Administration, or a
155 community-based substance use disorder treatment program.
156 Community-based programs utilized shall receive state or
157 federal funds in connection with such referral and shall
158 only refer the individual to a program certified by the
159 department of mental health, unless no appropriate certified
160 treatment program is located within the same circuit as the
161 veterans treatment court.
162 8. A mental health court may be established by any
163 circuit court to provide an alternative for the judicial
164 system to dispose of cases that stem from a mental health
165 disorder or co-occurring disorder.
