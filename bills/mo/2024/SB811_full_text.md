1 210.112. 1. It is the policy of this state and its

5 department of social services shall implement such system
6 subject to the following principles:
7 (1) The safety and welfare of children is paramount;
8 (2) All providers of direct services to children and
9 their families will be evaluated in a uniform, transparent,
10 objective, and consistent basis based on an evaluation tool
11 established in this section;
12 (3) Services to children and their families shall be
13 provided in a timely manner to maximize the opportunity for
SB 811 8
14 successful outcomes, and such services shall be tracked and
15 routinely evaluated through a quality assurance program;
16 (4) Any provider of direct services to children and
17 families shall have the appropriate and relevant training,
18 education, and expertise to provide the highest quality of
19 services possible which shall be consistent with federal and
20 state standards;
21 (5) Resources and efforts shall be committed to pursue
22 the best possible opportunity for a successful outcome for
23 each child. Successful outcomes may include preparing youth
24 for a productive and successful life as an adult outside the
25 foster care system, such as independent living. For those
26 providers that work with children requiring intensive twenty-
27 four-hour treatment services, successful outcomes shall be
28 based on the least restrictive alternative possible based on
29 the child's needs as well as the quality of care received;
30 and
31 (6) All service providers shall prioritize methods of
32 reducing or eliminating a child's need for residential
33 treatment through community-based services and supports.
34 2. (1) In conjunction with the response and
35 evaluation team established under subsection 3 of this
36 section, as well as other individuals the division deems
37 appropriate, the division shall establish an evaluation tool
38 that complies with state and federal guidelines.
39 (2) The evaluation tool shall include metrics
40 supporting best practices for case management and service
41 provision including, but not limited to, the frequency of
42 face-to-face visits with the child.
43 (3) There shall be a mechanism whereby providers may
44 propose different evaluation metrics on a case-by-case basis
45 if such case may have circumstances far beyond those that
SB 811 9
46 would be expected. Such cases shall be evaluated by the
47 response and evaluation team under subsection 3 of this
48 section.
49 (4) Data regarding all evaluation metrics shall be
50 collected by the division on a monthly basis, and the
51 division shall issue a quarterly report regarding the
52 evaluation data for each provider, both public and private,
53 by county. The response and evaluation team shall determine
54 how to aggregate cases for the division and large
55 contractors so that performance and outcomes may be compared
56 effectively while also protecting confidentiality. Such
57 reports shall be made public and shall include information
58 by county.
59 (5) The standards and metrics developed through this
60 evaluation tool shall be used to evaluate competitive bids
61 for future contracts established under subsection 4 of this
62 section.
63 3. The division shall create a response and evaluation
64 team. Membership of the team shall be composed of five
65 staff members from the division with experience in foster
66 care appointed by the director of the division; five
67 representatives, one from each contract region for foster
68 care case management contracts under this section, who shall
69 be annually rotated among contractors in each region, which

73 division and who shall be actively working for either an
74 academic institution or policy foundation; one juvenile
75 officer or a Missouri juvenile justice director to be
76 appointed by the Missouri Juvenile Justice Association; and
77 one juvenile or family court judge appointed by the supreme
SB 811 10
78 court. The division shall provide the necessary staffing
79 for the team's operations. All members shall be appointed
80 and the team shall meet for the first time before January 1,
81 2021. The team shall:
82 (1) Review the evaluation tool and metrics set forth
83 in subsection 2 of this section on a semiannual basis to
84 determine any adjustments needed or issues that could affect
85 the quality of such tools and approve or deny on a case-by-
86 case basis:
87 (a) Cases that a provider feels are anomalous and
88 should not be part of developing the case management tool
89 under subsection 2 of this section;
90 (b) Alternative evaluation metrics recommended by
91 providers based on the best interests of the child under
92 subsections 2 and 5 of this section; or
93 (c) Review and recommend any structure for incentives
94 or other reimbursement strategies under subsection 6 of this
95 section;
96 (2) Develop and execute periodic provider evaluations
97 of cases managed by the division and children service
98 providers contracted with the state to provide foster care
99 case management services, in the field under the evaluation
100 tool created under subsection 2 of this section to ensure
101 basic requirements of the program are met, which shall
102 include, but are not limited to, random file review to
103 ensure documentation shows required visits and case
104 management plan notes; and
105 (3) Develop a system for reviewing and working with
106 providers identified under subdivision (2) of this
107 subsection or providers who request such assistance from the
108 division who show signs of performance weakness to ensure
109 technical assistance and other services are offered to
SB 811 11
110 assist the providers in achieving successful outcomes for
111 their cases.
112 4. The children's division and any other state agency
113 deemed necessary by the division shall, in consultation with
114 service providers and other relevant parties, enter into and
115 implement contracts with qualified children's services
116 providers and agencies to provide a comprehensive and
117 deliberate system of service delivery for children and their
118 families. Contracts shall be awarded through a competitive
119 process and provided by qualified public and private not-for-
120 profit or limited liability corporations owned exclusively
121 by not-for-profit corporations children's services providers
122 and agencies which have:
123 (1) A proven record of providing child welfare
124 services within the state of Missouri which shall be
125 consistent with the federal standards, but not less than the
126 standards and policies used by the children's division as of
127 January 1, 2004; and
128 (2) The ability to provide a range of child welfare
129 services including, but not limited to, case management

132 services, foster care services, adoption services, relative
133 care case management, planned permanent living services, and
134 family reunification services.
135 No contracts under this section shall be issued for services
136 related to the child abuse and neglect hotline,
137 investigations of alleged abuse and neglect, and initial
138 family assessments, except for services designed to assist
139 the division in ascertaining child safety and providing
140 preventative services. Any contracts entered into by the
SB 811 12
141 division shall be in accordance with all federal laws and
142 regulations, and shall seek to maximize federal funding.
143 Children's services providers and agencies under contract
144 with the division shall be subject to all federal, state,
145 and local laws and regulations relating to the provision of
146 such services, and shall be subject to oversight and
147 inspection by appropriate state agencies to assure
148 compliance with standards which shall be consistent with the
149 federal standards.
150 5. The division shall accept as prima facie evidence
151 of completion of the requirements for licensure under
152 sections 210.481 to 210.511 proof that an agency is
153 accredited by any of the following nationally recognized
154 bodies: the Council on Accreditation of Services, Children
155 and Families, Inc.; the Joint Commission on Accreditation of
156 Hospitals; or the Commission on Accreditation of
157 Rehabilitation Facilities.
158 6. Payment to the children's services providers and
159 agencies shall be made based on the reasonable costs of
160 services, including responsibilities necessary to execute
161 the contract. Any reimbursement increases made through
162 enhanced appropriations for services shall be allocated to
163 providers regardless of whether the provider is public or
164 private. Such increases shall be considered additive to the
165 existing contracts. In addition to payments reflecting the
166 cost of services, contracts shall include incentives
167 provided in recognition of performance based on the
168 evaluation tool created under subsection 2 of this section
169 and the corresponding savings for the state. The response
170 and evaluation team under subsection 3 of this section shall
171 review a formula to distribute such payments, as recommended
172 by the division.
SB 811 13
173 7. The division shall consider immediate actions that
174 are in the best interests of the children served including,
175 but not limited to, placing the agency on a corrective plan,
176 halting new referrals, transferring cases to other
177 performing providers, or terminating the provider's
178 contract. The division shall take steps necessary to
179 evaluate the nature of the issue and act accordingly in the
180 most timely fashion possible.

182 promulgate and have in effect rules to implement the
183 provisions of this section and, pursuant to this section,
184 shall define implementation plans and dates. Any rule or
185 portion of a rule, as that term is defined in section
186 536.010, that is created under the authority delegated in
187 this section shall become effective only if it complies with
188 and is subject to all of the provisions of chapter 536 and,
189 if applicable, section 536.028. This section and chapter
190 536 are nonseverable and if any of the powers vested with
191 the general assembly pursuant to chapter 536 to review, to
192 delay the effective date, or to disapprove and annul a rule
193 are subsequently held unconstitutional, then the grant of
194 rulemaking authority and any rule proposed or adopted after
195 August 28, 2004, shall be invalid and void.

SB 811 14
10 the division, or cooperating with a qualified individual
11 pursuant to section 210.715, or any other law enforcement
12 agency, juvenile office, court, state agency, or child-
13 protective service agency of this or any other state, in any
14 of the activities pursuant to sections [210.110] 210.109 to

16 abuse, neglect or assault, pursuant to sections 568.045 to
17 568.060, shall have immunity from any liability, civil or
18 criminal, that otherwise might result by reason of such
19 actions. Provided, however, any person, official or

21 bad faith, or with ill intent, shall not have immunity from
22 any liability, civil or criminal. Any such person,
23 official, or institution shall have the same immunity with
24 respect to participation in any judicial proceeding
25 resulting from the report.
26 2. An employee, including a contracted employee, of a
27 state-funded child assessment center, as provided for in
28 subsection 2 of section 210.001, shall be immune from any
29 civil liability that arises from the employee's
30 participation in the investigation process and services by
31 the child assessment center, unless such person acted in bad
32 faith. This subsection shall not displace or limit any
33 other immunity provided by law.
34 3. Any person, who is not a school district employee,
35 who makes a report to any employee of the school district of

39 such person who makes a false report, knowing that the
40 report is false, or who acts in bad faith or with ill intent
41 in making such report shall not have immunity from any
SB 811 15
42 liability, civil or criminal. Any such person shall have
43 the same immunity with respect to participation in any
44 judicial proceeding resulting from the report.
45 4. In a case involving the death or serious injury of
46 a child after a report has been made under sections 210.109
47 to 210.165, the division shall conduct a preliminary
48 evaluation in order to determine whether a review of the
49 ability of the circuit manager or case worker or workers to
50 perform their duties competently is necessary. The

27 remain in current placement or be moved to a new placement;
28 visitation schedule for the child's family; and any
29 additional core commitments. Any dissenting views shall be
30 recorded and attested to on such form. The parents and any
31 other party shall be provided with a copy of the signed
32 document.]
SB 811 17
1 210.715. 1. As used in this section, the following
2 terms shall mean:
3 (1) "Child", any person in the legal custody of the
4 children's division and over whom the court has maintained
5 jurisdiction;
6 (2) "Qualified individual", a trained professional or
7 licensed clinician who is not an employee of the children's
8 division and who is not connected to, or affiliated with,
9 any placement setting in which children are placed by the
10 children's division. The children's division shall
11 establish the qualifications of the qualified individual by
12 regulation;
13 (3) "Qualified residential treatment program" or
14 "QRTP", a program that has met all program requirements for
15 designation as a QRTP, as determined by the children's
16 division;
17 (4) "Residential setting", a congregate setting that
18 provides twenty-four hour supervision to a child for the
19 purposes of rehabilitative treatment related to emotional
20 and psychiatric needs, learning difficulties, behavioral
21 disorders, trauma histories, or developmental challenges
22 that require a higher level of supervision and treatment
23 than is available in a foster home setting. This setting
24 shall include:
25 (a) A qualified residential treatment program (QRTP);
26 (b) A psychiatric residential treatment facility
27 (PRTF); or
28 (c) A residential care facility licensed by the
29 children's division to provide residential treatment or
30 intensive residential services.
SB 811 18
31 Residential settings shall not include emergency shelters,
32 maternity homes for pregnant or parenting youth, contracted
33 transitional living settings, and placements licensed or
34 certified by the division of developmental disabilities
35 within the department of mental health.
36 2. If a child is placed in a residential setting, the
37 children's division shall arrange for a qualified individual
38 to complete an assessment of the child within thirty days of
39 the start of each placement in a residential setting. The
40 assessment shall be in writing and shall:
41 (1) Assess the strengths and needs of the child using
42 an age-appropriate, trauma-informed, evidence-based, and
43 validated tool approved by the children's division;
44 (2) Assess whether the needs of the child can be met
45 through placement with family members or in a foster home;
46 (3) Explain why the child's placement in a residential
47 setting will be the most effective and appropriate level of
48 care in the least restrictive environment, if the needs of
49 the child cannot be met with family members or in a foster
50 home;
51 (4) Describe how that placement is consistent with the
52 short-term and long-term goals for the child, as specified
53 in the child's permanency plan; and
54 (5) Develop a list of child-specific short-term and
55 long-term mental and behavioral health goals.
56 3. The children's division shall assemble a family
57 support team for the child in accordance with the
58 requirements of section 210.762. The qualified individual
59 conducting the assessment shall work in conjunction with the
60 family of, and family support team for, the child while
61 conducting and making the assessment.
SB 811 19
62 4. Notwithstanding any other provision of law to the
63 contrary, the qualified individual shall have unlimited
64 access to any and all records and information pertaining to
65 the child that the qualified individual determines are
66 necessary to complete the assessment, including, but not
67 limited to, medical records, therapy records, psychological
68 and psychiatric evaluations, educational records, law
69 enforcement records, and placement history, including
70 progress reports from such placements.
71 5. The qualified individual shall provide the written
72 assessment to the children's division. The children's
73 division shall provide a copy of the assessment to the
74 parties to the juvenile proceeding, the members of the
75 family support team, and the court.
76 6. Within sixty days of the start of each placement in
77 a QRTP, the court shall assess the appropriateness for the
78 child remaining in the QRTP. A copy of the assessment, as
79 redacted, shall be admitted into evidence by the court
80 without further foundation. The court shall make specific
81 written findings of fact on the record and:
82 (1) Consider the assessment, determination, and
83 documentation made by the qualified individual conducting
84 the assessment;
85 (2) Determine whether the needs of the child can be
86 met through placement in a foster home or, if not, whether
87 placement of the child in the QRTP provides the most
88 effective and appropriate level of care for the child in the
89 least restrictive environment;
90 (3) Determine whether that placement is consistent
91 with the short-term and long-term goals for the child, as
92 specified in the permanency plan for the child; and
93 (4) Approve or disapprove the placement.
SB 811 20
94 7. The court shall reassess the appropriateness for
95 the child remaining in a QRTP at every hearing subsequent to
96 the child's placement in the QRTP and make written findings
97 of fact as required in subsection 6 of this section until
98 the child is no longer placed in the QRTP.
99 8. The children's division may promulgate rules,
100 including emergency rules, to implement the provisions of
101 this section. Any rule or portion of a rule, as that term
102 is defined in section 536.010, that is created under the
103 authority delegated in this section shall become effective
104 only if it complies with and is subject to all of the
105 provisions of chapter 536 and, if applicable, section
106 536.028. This section and chapter 536 are nonseverable and
107 if any of the powers vested with the general assembly
108 pursuant to chapter 536 to review, to delay the effective
109 date, or to disapprove and annul a rule are subsequently
110 held unconstitutional, then the grant of rulemaking
111 authority and any rule proposed or adopted after August 28,
112 2024, shall be invalid and void.
1 210.762. 1. When a child is taken into custody by a
2 juvenile officer, physician, or law enforcement official
3 [under] pursuant to section 210.125 and comes under the
4 jurisdiction of the court pursuant to subdivision (1) and
5 (2) of subsection 1 of section 211.031 and [initially]
6 placed with the division, the division may make a temporary
7 placement and shall arrange for a family support team
8 meeting prior to or within twenty-four hours following the
9 protective custody hearing held under section 211.032. After
10 a child is in the division's custody [and a temporary
11 placement has been made], the division shall arrange an
12 additional family support team meeting prior to taking any
13 action relating to the placement of such child; except that,
SB 811 21
14 when the welfare of a child in the custody of the division
15 requires an immediate or emergency change of placement, the
16 division may make a temporary placement and shall schedule a
17 family support team meeting within seventy-two hours. The
18 requirement for a family support team meeting shall not
19 apply when the parent has consented in writing to the
20 termination of his or her parental rights in conjunction
21 with a placement in a licensed child-placing agency under
22 subsection 6 of section 453.010.
23 2. The parents, the legal counsel for the parents, the
24 foster parents, the legal guardian or custodian of the
25 child, the guardian ad litem for the child, and the
26 volunteer advocate, and any designee of the parent that has
27 written authorization shall be notified and invited to
28 participate in all family support team meetings. The family
29 support team meeting may include such other persons whose
30 attendance at the meeting may assist the team in making
31 appropriate decisions in the best interests of the child,
32 including biological family members and relatives, as
33 appropriate, as well as professionals who are a resource to
34 the family of the child, such as teachers, medical or mental
35 health providers who have treated the child, or clergy. In
36 the case of a child who is age fourteen or older, the family
37 support team shall include the members selected by the
38 child. The division may exclude an individual from a family
39 support team meeting or make alternative arrangements for an
40 individual to express his or her views if an individual
41 becomes disruptive to the meeting.
42 3. If the division finds that it is not in the best
43 interest of a child to be placed with relatives, the
44 division shall make specific findings in the division's
45 report detailing the reasons why the best interests of the
SB 811 22
46 child necessitate placement of the child with persons other
47 than relatives.
48 [3. The division shall use the form created in
49 subsection 2 of section 210.147 to be signed upon the
50 conclusion of the meeting pursuant to subsection 1 of this
51 section confirming that all involved parties are aware of
52 the team's decision regarding the custody and placement of
53 the child. Any dissenting views must be recorded and
54 attested to on such form.]
55 4. The division shall be responsible for developing a
56 form to be signed at the conclusion of any team meeting held
57 in relation to a child removed from the home and placed in
58 the custody of the state that reflects the core commitments
59 made by the children's division or the convenor of the team
60 meeting and the parents of the child or any other party.
61 The content of the form shall be consistent with service
62 agreements or case plans required by statute, but not the
63 specific address of the child; whether the child shall
64 remain in current placement or be moved to a new placement;
65 visitation schedule for the child's family; and any
66 additional core commitments. Any dissenting views shall be
67 recorded and attested to on such form. The parents and any
68 other party shall be provided with a copy of the signed
69 document.
70 [4.] 5. The [case manager] division shall be
71 responsible for including such form with the case records of
72 the child.
1 211.081. 1. Whenever any person informs the juvenile
2 officer in writing that a child appears to be within the
3 purview of applicable provisions of section 211.031, the
4 juvenile officer shall make or cause to be made a
5 preliminary inquiry to determine the facts and to determine
SB 811 23
6 whether or not the interests of the public or of the child
7 require that further action be taken. On the basis of this
8 inquiry, the juvenile officer may make such informal
9 adjustment as is practicable without a petition or file a
10 petition. Any other provision of this chapter to the
11 contrary notwithstanding, the juvenile court shall not make
12 any order for disposition of a child which would place or
13 commit the child to any location outside the state of
14 Missouri without first receiving the approval of the
15 children's division.
16 2. Placement in any [institutional] residential
17 setting, as defined in section 210.715, shall represent the
18 least restrictive appropriate placement for the child and
19 shall [be recommended based upon a psychological or
20 psychiatric evaluation or both] meet all requirements set
21 forth in section 210.715. Prior to entering any order for
22 disposition of a child which would order residential
23 treatment or other services inside the state of Missouri,
24 the juvenile court shall enter findings which include the
25 recommendation of the psychological or psychiatric
26 evaluation or both; and certification from the division
27 director or designee as to whether a provider or funds or
28 both are available, including a projection of their future
29 availability. If the children's division indicates that
30 funding is not available, the division shall recommend and
31 make available for placement by the court an alternative
32 placement for the child. The division shall have the burden
33 of demonstrating that they have exercised due diligence in
34 utilizing all available services to carry out the
35 recommendation of the evaluation team and serve the best
36 interest of the child. The judge shall not order placement
37 or an alternative placement with a specific provider but may
SB 811 24
38 reasonably designate the scope and type of the services
39 which shall be provided by the department to the child. For
40 purposes of this subsection, the word "child" shall have the
41 same meaning as in section 210.715.
42 3. Obligations of the state incurred under the
43 provisions of section 211.181 shall not exceed, in any
44 fiscal year, the amount appropriated for this purpose.
1 566.151. 1. A person twenty-one years of age or older
2 commits the offense of enticement of a child if he or she
3 persuades, solicits, coaxes, entices, or lures whether by
4 words, actions or through communication via the internet or
5 any electronic communication, any person who is less than
6 [fifteen] seventeen years of age for the purpose of engaging
7 in sexual conduct.
8 2. It is not a defense to a prosecution for a
9 violation of this section that the other person was a peace
10 officer masquerading as a minor.
11 3. Enticement of a child or an attempt to commit
12 enticement of a child is a felony for which the authorized
13 term of imprisonment shall be not less than five years and
14 not more than thirty years. No person convicted under this
15 section shall be eligible for parole, probation, conditional
16 release, or suspended imposition or execution of sentence
17 for a period of five calendar years.
1 567.030. 1. A person commits the offense of
2 patronizing prostitution if he or she:
3 (1) Pursuant to a prior understanding, gives something
4 of value to another person as compensation for having
5 engaged in sexual conduct with any person; or
6 (2) Gives or agrees to give something of value to
7 another person with the understanding that such person or
SB 811 25
8 another person will engage in sexual conduct with any
9 person; or
10 (3) Solicits or requests another person to engage in
11 sexual conduct with any person in return for something of
12 value.
13 2. It shall not be a defense that the person believed
14 that the individual he or she patronized for prostitution
15 was eighteen years of age or older.
16 3. The offense of patronizing prostitution is a class
17 B misdemeanor, unless the individual who the person
18 patronizes is less than eighteen years of age but older than
19 [fourteen] fifteen years of age, in which case patronizing
20 prostitution is a class E felony.
21 4. The offense of patronizing prostitution is a class
22 [D] B felony if the individual who the person patronizes is
23 [fourteen] fifteen years of age or younger. Nothing in this
24 section shall preclude the prosecution of an individual for
25 the offenses of:
26 (1) Statutory rape in the first degree pursuant to
27 section 566.032;
28 (2) Statutory rape in the second degree pursuant to
29 section 566.034;
30 (3) Statutory sodomy in the first degree pursuant to
31 section 566.062; or
32 (4) Statutory sodomy in the second degree pursuant to
33 section 566.064.
