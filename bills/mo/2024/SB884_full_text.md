2 allowed under sections [253.545] 253.544 to 253.559, a
3 taxpayer shall submit an application for tax credits to the

53 selected for review, a taxpayer shall not be permitted to
54 request the review of another property for approval in the
55 place of the property contained in such application. Any
56 disapproved application shall be removed from the review

64 purposes of the priority procedures described in this
65 section.
66 3. (1) In evaluating an application for tax credits
67 submitted under this section, the department [of economic
68 development] shall also consider:

105 rehabilitation satisfies the qualified rehabilitation
106 standard.
107 5. (1) The department shall promptly notify the state
108 historic preservation office of each preliminary application
109 for tax credits. After receipt of such notice, the state
110 historic preservation office shall determine whether a
111 rehabilitation satisfies the qualified rehabilitation
112 standards within ninety days of a taxpayer filing an initial
113 application for tax credits. The determination shall be
114 based upon evidence that the rehabilitation will meet
SB 884 14
115 qualified rehabilitation standards, and that evidence shall
116 consist of one of the following:
117 (a) Preliminary approval by the state historic
118 preservation office; or
119 (b) An approved part 2 of the federal application,
120 which the state historic preservation office shall forward
121 directly to the department without any additional review by
122 such office.
123 (2) If the state historic preservation office approves
124 the application for tax credits within the ninety-day
125 determination period established in subdivision (1) of this
126 subsection, such office shall forward the application with
127 any review comments to the National Park Service and shall
128 forward any such review comments to the applicant. If such
129 office fails to approve the application within the ninety-
130 day determination period, such office shall forward the
131 application without any comments to the National Park
132 Service and shall have no further opportunity to submit any
133 comments on such application.
134 (3) Conditions on a state preliminary application or
135 on part 2 of a federal application shall not delay
136 preliminary state approval but shall be addressed by the
137 applicant for final approval of such application.
138 (4) Any application for state tax credits that does
139 not include an application for federal tax credits or a
140 nomination to the federal National Register of Historic
141 Places shall be reviewed by the state historic preservation
142 office within ninety days of a notice received under
143 subdivision (1) of this subsection.
144 (5) (a) An application for state tax credits may
145 provide information indicating that the project is a phased
146 rehabilitation project as described under 26 U.S.C. Section
SB 884 15
147 47, as amended. Such application for a phased
148 rehabilitation project shall include at least the following:
149 a. A schedule of the phases of the project with a
150 beginning date for each phase and the expected costs for the
151 whole project. The applicant may submit detailed plans for
152 the project at a later time within the application process;
153 b. The adjusted total basis of such project, which
154 shall be submitted with the schedule of phases of the
155 project; and
156 c. A statement that the applicant agrees to begin each
157 phase of such project within twelve months of the start date
158 for such phase listed in the schedule of the phases.
159 (b) The applicant may submit a preliminary
160 certification of costs upon the completion of each phase of
161 the project.
162 (c) Upon approval of the cost certification submitted
163 and the work completed on each phase of such project, the
164 department shall issue eighty percent of the amount of the
165 state tax credit for which the taxpayer is approved under
166 this section. The remaining twenty percent of the amount of
167 the state tax credit for which the taxpayer is approved
168 under this section shall be issued upon the final approval
169 of the project under this section.
170 (6) If the department determines that the amount of
171 tax credits issued to a taxpayer under subdivision (5) of
172 this subsection is in excess of the total amount of tax
173 credits such taxpayer is eligible to receive, the department
174 shall notify such taxpayer, and such taxpayer shall repay
175 the department an amount equal to such excess.
176 [4.] 6. If the department [of economic development]
177 deems the application sufficient, the taxpayer shall be
178 notified in writing of the approval for an amount of tax
SB 884 16
179 credits equal to the amount provided under section 253.550
180 less any amount of tax credits previously approved. Such
181 approvals shall be granted to applications in the order of
182 priority established under this section and shall require
183 full compliance thereafter with all other requirements of
184 law as a condition to any claim for such credits. If the
185 department [of economic development] disapproves an
186 application, the taxpayer shall be notified in writing of
187 the reasons for such disapproval. A disapproved application
188 may be resubmitted. If the scope of a project for which an
189 application has been approved under this section materially
190 changes, the taxpayer shall be eligible to receive
191 additional tax credits in the year in which the department
192 is notified of and approves of such change in scope, subject
193 to the provisions of subsection 2 of section 253.550 and
194 subsection 7 of this section, if applicable; however, if
195 such project was originally approved prior to August 28,
196 2018, the department shall evaluate the change in scope of
197 the project under the criteria in effect prior to such
198 date. A change in project scope shall be considered
199 material under this subsection if:
200 (1) The project was not previously subject to a
201 material change in scope for which additional tax credits
202 were approved; and
203 (2) The requested amount of tax credits for the
204 project after the change in scope is higher than the
205 originally approved amount of tax credits.
206 [5.] 7. Following approval of an application, the
207 identity of the taxpayer contained in such application shall
208 not be modified except:
209 (1) The taxpayer may add partners, members, or
210 shareholders as part of the ownership structure, so long as
SB 884 17
211 the principal remains [the same] a principal of the
212 taxpayer, provided however, that subsequent to the
213 commencement of renovation and the expenditure of at least
214 ten percent of the proposed rehabilitation budget, removal
215 of the principal for failure to perform duties and the
216 appointment of a new principal thereafter shall not
217 constitute a change of the principal; or
218 (2) Where the ownership of the project is changed due
219 to a foreclosure, deed in lieu of a foreclosure or voluntary
220 conveyance, or a transfer in bankruptcy.
221 [6.] 8. In the event that the department [of economic
222 development] grants approval for tax credits equal to the
223 total amount available or authorized, as applicable, under
224 subsection 2 of section 253.550, or sufficient that when
225 totaled with all other approvals, the amount available or
226 authorized, as applicable, under subsection 2 of section
227 253.550 is exhausted, all taxpayers with applications then
228 awaiting approval or thereafter submitted for approval shall
229 be notified by the department [of economic development] that
230 no additional approvals shall be granted during the fiscal
231 year and shall be notified of the priority given to such
232 taxpayer's application then awaiting approval. Such
233 applications shall be kept on file by the department [of
234 economic development] and shall be considered for approval
235 for tax credits in the order established in this section in
236 the event that additional credits become available due to
237 the rescission of approvals or when a new fiscal year's
238 allocation of credits becomes available for approval or
239 authorized, as applicable.
240 [7.] 9. All taxpayers with applications receiving
241 approval on or after July 1, 2019, shall submit within
242 [sixty] one hundred twenty days following the award of
SB 884 18
243 credits evidence of the capacity of the applicant to finance
244 the costs and expenses for the rehabilitation of the
245 eligible property in the form of a line of credit or letter
246 of commitment subject to the lender's termination for a
247 material adverse change impacting the extension of credit.
248 If the department [of economic development] determines that
249 a taxpayer has failed to comply with the requirements under
250 this subsection, then the department shall notify the
251 applicant of such failure and the applicant shall have a
252 thirty-day period from the date of such notice to submit
253 additional evidence to remedy the failure.
254 [8.] 10. All taxpayers with applications receiving
255 approval on or after the effective date of this act shall
256 commence rehabilitation within [nine] eighteen months of the
257 date of issuance of the letter from the department [of
258 economic development] granting the approval for tax
259 credits. "Commencement of rehabilitation" shall mean that
260 as of the date in which actual physical work, contemplated
261 by the architectural plans submitted with the application,
262 has begun, the taxpayer has incurred no less than ten
263 percent of the estimated costs of rehabilitation provided in
264 the application. Taxpayers with approval of a project shall
265 submit evidence of compliance with the provisions of this
266 subsection. Taxpayers shall notify the department of any
267 loss of site control or of any failure to exercise any
268 option to obtain site control within the prescribed time
269 period within ten days of such loss or failure. If the
270 department [of economic development] determines that a
271 taxpayer has lost or failed to obtain site control of the
272 eligible property or otherwise failed to comply with the
273 requirements provided under this section, the approval for
274 the amount of tax credits for such taxpayer shall be
SB 884 19
275 rescinded [and such amount of tax credits]. A taxpayer may
276 voluntarily forfeit such approval at any time by written
277 notice to the department. Any approval rescinded or
278 forfeited under this subsection shall then be included in
279 the total amount of tax credits available in the year of
280 such rescission or forfeiture, provided under subsection 2
281 of section 253.550, from which approvals may be granted.
282 Any taxpayer whose approval [shall be subject to rescission]
283 is rescinded or forfeited under this subsection shall be
284 notified of such from the department [of economic
285 development] and, upon receipt of such notice, may submit a
286 new application for the project. If a taxpayer's approval
287 is rescinded or forfeited under this subsection and such
288 taxpayer later submits a new application for the same
289 project, any expenditures eligible for tax credits under
290 section 253.550 that are incurred by such taxpayer from and
291 after the date of the rescinded or forfeited approval shall
292 remain eligible expenditures for the purposes of determining
293 the amount of tax credits that may be approved under section
294 253.550.
295 [9.] 11. (1) (a) To claim the credit authorized
296 under sections [253.550] 253.544 to 253.559, a taxpayer with
297 approval shall apply for final approval and issuance of tax
298 credits from the department [of economic development],
299 which[, in consultation with the department of natural
300 resources,] shall determine the final amount of eligible
301 rehabilitation costs and expenses and whether the completed
302 rehabilitation meets the qualified rehabilitation standards
303 of the Secretary of the United States Department of the
304 Interior for rehabilitation [as determined by the state
305 historic preservation officer of the Missouri department of
306 natural resources].
SB 884 20
307 (b) Final approval shall be shown by one of the
308 following:
309 a. Final approval by the state historic preservation
310 office; or
311 b. An approved part 3 of the federal application.
312 (c) For applications for tax credits for an eligible
313 property for which a taxpayer applies for both the federal
314 historic preservation certification under the Internal
315 Revenue Code of 1986, as amended, and the state historic tax
316 credits under section 253.544 to 253.559, a taxpayer may
317 submit part 1 of the federal application approved by the
318 National Park Service with such state tax credit
319 application. In such instances, the state tax credit
320 application may proceed as a preliminary application
321 concurrent with the associated federal process for
322 nomination to the National Register of Historic Places. An
323 award of tax credits under sections 253.544 to 253.559 shall
324 be contingent on and awarded upon the listing of such
325 eligible property on the National Register of Historic
326 Places.
327 (d) The state historic preservation office shall allow
328 for a third-party review as evidence that the completed
329 rehabilitation satisfies the qualified rehabilitation
330 standards.
331 (2) Within sixty days of the department's receipt of
332 all materials required by the department for an application
333 for final approval and issuance of tax credits, which shall
334 include a state approval by the state historic preservation
335 office or an approved part 3 of the federal application for
336 projects receiving federal rehabilitation credits, the
337 department shall issue to the taxpayer tax credit
SB 884 21
338 certificates in the amount of seventy-five percent of the
339 lesser of:
340 (a) The total amount of the tax credits for which the
341 taxpayer is eligible as provided in the taxpayer's
342 certification of qualified expenses submitted with an
343 application for final approval; or
344 (b) The total amount of tax credits approved for such
345 project under subsection 3 of this section, including any
346 amounts approved in connection with a material change in the
347 scope of the project.
348 (3) Within one hundred twenty days of the department's
349 receipt of all materials required by the department for an
350 application of final approval and issuance of tax credits
351 for a project, the department shall, unless such project is
352 under appeal under subsection 14 of this section:
353 (a) Make a final determination of the total costs and
354 expenses of rehabilitation and the amount of tax credits to
355 be issued for such costs and expenses;
356 (b) Notify the taxpayer in writing of its final
357 determination; and
358 (c) Issue to the taxpayer tax credit certificates in
359 an amount equal to the remaining amount of tax credits such
360 taxpayer is eligible to receive, as determined by the
361 department, but was not issued in the initial tax credit
362 issuance under subdivision (2) of this subsection.
363 (4) If the department determines that the amount of
364 tax credits issued to a taxpayer in the initial tax credit
365 issuance under subdivision (2) of this subsection is in
366 excess of the total amount of tax credits such taxpayer is
367 eligible to receive, the department shall notify such
368 taxpayer, and such taxpayer shall repay the department an
369 amount equal to such excess.
SB 884 22
370 (5) For financial institutions credits authorized
371 pursuant to sections [253.550 to 253.561] 253.544 to 253.559
372 shall be deemed to be economic development credits for
373 purposes of section 148.064. The approval of all
374 applications and the issuing of certificates of eligible
375 credits to taxpayers shall be performed by the department
376 [of economic development]. The department [of economic
377 development] shall inform a taxpayer of final approval by
378 letter and shall issue, to the taxpayer, tax credit
379 certificates. The taxpayer shall attach the certificate to
380 all Missouri income tax returns on which the credit is
381 claimed.
382 [10.] 12. Except as expressly provided in this
383 subsection, tax credit certificates shall be issued in the
384 final year that costs and expenses of rehabilitation of the
385 project are incurred, or within the twelve-month period
386 immediately following the conclusion of such
387 rehabilitation. In the event the amount of eligible
388 rehabilitation costs and expenses incurred by a taxpayer
389 would result in the issuance of an amount of tax credits in
390 excess of the amount provided under such taxpayer's approval
391 granted under subsection [4] 6 of this section, such
392 taxpayer may apply to the department for issuance of tax
393 credits in an amount equal to such excess. Applications for
394 issuance of tax credits in excess of the amount provided
395 under a taxpayer's application shall be made on a form
396 prescribed by the department. Such applications shall be
397 subject to all provisions regarding priority provided under
398 subsection 1 of this section.
399 [11.] 13. The department [of economic development]
400 shall determine, on an annual basis, the overall economic
SB 884 23
401 impact to the state from the rehabilitation of eligible
402 property.
403 14. (1) With regard to an application submitted under
404 sections 253.544 to 253.559, an applicant or an applicant's
405 duly authorized representative may appeal any official
406 decision, including all preliminary or final approvals,
407 denials of approvals, or dollar amounts of issued tax
408 credits, made by the department of economic development or
409 the state historic preservation office. Such an appeal
410 shall constitute an administrative review of the decision
411 and shall not be conducted as an adjudicative proceeding.
412 (2) The department shall establish an equitable
413 appeals process.
414 (3) The appeals process shall incorporate an
415 independent review panel consisting of members of the
416 private sector and the department.

422 authorized representative of the decision that is the
423 subject of the appeal and shall include all information the
424 appellant wishes the appeals officer or review panel to
425 consider in deciding the appeal.
426 (6) Within fourteen days of receipt of an appeal, the
427 appeals officer or review panel shall notify the department
428 of economic development or the state historic preservation
429 office that an appeal is pending, identify the decision
430 being appealed, and forward a copy of the information

432 development or the state historic preservation office may
433 submit a written response to the appeal within thirty days.
434 (7) The appellant shall be entitled to one meeting
435 with the appeals officer or review panel to discuss the

437 additional meetings at the officer's or panel's discretion.
438 The department of economic development or the state historic
439 preservation office may appear at any such meeting.
440 (8) The appeals officer or review panel shall consider
441 the record of the decision in question; any further written
442 submissions by the appellant, department of economic
443 development, or state historic preservation office; and
444 other available information and shall deliver a written
445 decision to all parties as promptly as circumstances permit
446 but no later than ninety days after the initial receipt of
447 an appeal by the appeals officer or review panel.
448 (9) The appeals officer and the members of the review
449 panel shall serve without compensation.
