11 child petitions the court for child support within two years of the child's birth and
12 requests that support payments include the months the mother was pregnant with the
13 child. If paternity is disputed, a biological father owes no duty under this section until

20 consultation with the mother, taking into account the best interests of the mother and
21 child.
22 5. If, after the child is born, paternity is established to belong to someone other
23 than the putative father, the putative father may bring a cause of action against the
24 actual father for reimbursement of any child support paid by the putative father under
25 this section.
