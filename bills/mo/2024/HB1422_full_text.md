82 survivor or beneficiary as a result of the judge's death. In that event, the beneficiary of the
83 survivor or beneficiary who received the annuity shall receive a refund upon the survivor's or
84 beneficiary's death equal to the amount, if any, of the judge's contributions less any annuity
85 amounts received by the judge and the survivor or beneficiary.
