AN ACT
To repeal section 537.610, RSMo, and to enact in lieu thereof one new section relating to the
purchasing of liability insurance for tort claims made against public entities.
Be it enacted by the General Assembly of the State of Missouri, as follows:
1 Section A. Section 537.610, RSMo, is repealed and one new
2 section enacted in lieu thereof, to be known as section 537.610,
3 to read as follows:
1 537.610. 1. The commissioner of administration,
2 through the purchasing division, and the governing body of
3 each political subdivision of this state, notwithstanding
4 any other provision of law, may purchase liability insurance
5 for tort claims, made against the state or the political
6 subdivision, but the maximum amount of such coverage shall
7 not exceed two million dollars for all claims arising out of
8 a single occurrence and shall not exceed three hundred
9 thousand dollars for any one person in a single accident or
10 occurrence, except for those claims governed by the
11 provisions of the Missouri workers' compensation law,
12 chapter 287, and no amount in excess of the above limits
13 shall be awarded or settled upon. Sovereign immunity for
14 the state of Missouri and its political subdivisions is
15 waived only to the maximum amount of and only for the
16 purposes covered by such policy of insurance purchased
17 pursuant to the provisions of this section and in such
18 amount and for such purposes provided in any self-insurance
SB 1346 2
19 plan duly adopted by the governing body of any political
20 subdivision of the state. For purposes of this section, the
21 term "purchase" refers only to the direct acquisition by a
22 governing body of a political subdivision of this state of
23 insurance coverage from an insurance company or other
24 business entity and does not include any indirect action by
25 contract or otherwise including, but not limited to,
26 requiring additional coverage or insured status under the
27 insurance policy of another person or entity.
28 2. The liability of the state and its public entities
29 on claims within the scope of sections 537.600 to 537.650,
30 shall not exceed two million dollars for all claims arising
31 out of a single accident or occurrence and shall not exceed
32 three hundred thousand dollars for any one person in a
33 single accident or occurrence, except for those claims
34 governed by the provisions of the Missouri workers'
35 compensation law, chapter 287.
36 3. No award for damages on any claim against a public
37 entity within the scope of sections 537.600 to 537.650,
38 shall include punitive or exemplary damages.
39 4. If the amount awarded to or settled upon multiple
40 claimants exceeds two million dollars, any party may apply
41 to any circuit court to apportion to each claimant his
42 proper share of the total amount limited by subsection 1 of
43 this section. The share apportioned each claimant shall be
44 in the proportion that the ratio of the award or settlement
45 made to him bears to the aggregate awards and settlements
46 for all claims arising out of the accident or occurrence,
47 but the share shall not exceed three hundred thousand
48 dollars.
49 5. The limitation on awards for liability provided for
50 in this section shall be increased or decreased on an annual
SB 1346 3
51 basis effective January first of each year in accordance
52 with the Implicit Price Deflator for Personal Consumption
53 Expenditures as published by the Bureau of Economic Analysis
54 of the United States Department of Commerce. The current
55 value of the limitation shall be calculated by the director
56 of the department of commerce and insurance, who shall
57 furnish that value to the secretary of state, who shall
58 publish such value in the Missouri Register as soon after
59 each January first as practicable, but it shall otherwise be
60 exempt from the provisions of section 536.021.
61 6. Any claim filed against any public entity under
62 this section shall be subject to the penalties provided by
63 supreme court rule 55.03, or any successor rule.
