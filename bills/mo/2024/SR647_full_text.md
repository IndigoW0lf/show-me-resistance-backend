SENATE RESOLUTION NO. 647
NOTICE OF PROPOSED RULE CHANGE
Notice is hereby given by the Senator from the 22nd District of the one day notice
required by rule of intent to put a motion to adopt the following rule change:
BE IT RESOLVED by the Senate of the One Hundred Second
General Assembly, Second Regular Session, that the Senate
Rule 8 be amended to read as follows:
"Rule 8. Upon the call of the senate, the names of the
senators shall be called by the secretary and the absentees
noted, after which the names of the absentees may again be
called. Those absent senators from whom no sufficient
excuses are made may, by order of a majority of those
present, if ten in number, be taken into custody as they
appear, or be sent for and taken into custody wherever found
by the sergeant-at-arms, or other person appointed by the
senate for that purpose, at the expense of such absent
senators or senator, respectively, unless such excuse for
nonattendance shall be made as the senate, when a quorum is
convened, shall judge sufficient. If an absence of a quorum
is noted, then the senator who noted the absence of a quorum
shall be counted for purposes of establishing a quorum,
regardless of whether such senator leaves the floor.".
