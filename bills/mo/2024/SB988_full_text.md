1 456.950. 1. As used in this section, "qualified
2 spousal trust" means a trust:
3 (1) The settlors of which are married to each other at
4 the time of the creation of the trust; and
5 (2) The terms of which provide that during the joint
6 lives of the settlors or the life of the sole surviving
7 settlor all property transferred to, or held by, the trustee
8 are:
9 (a) Held and administered in one trust for the benefit
10 of both settlors, which may be revocable by either settlor

19 settlors, with the trust revocable by each settlor with
20 respect to that settlor's separate share of that trust
21 without the participation or consent of the other settlor,
22 and each settlor having the right to receive distributions
23 of income or principal, whether mandatory or within the
24 discretion of the trustee, from that settlor's separate
25 share for that settlor's life; or
26 (c) Held and administered under the terms and
27 conditions contained in paragraphs (a) and (b) of this
28 subdivision.
29 2. A qualified spousal trust may contain any other
30 trust terms that are not inconsistent with the provisions of
31 this section, including, without limitation, a discretionary
32 power to distribute trust property to a person in addition
33 to a settlor.
34 3. All property at any time held in a qualified
35 spousal trust, without regard to how such property was
36 titled prior to it being so held[,]:
37 (1) Shall have the same immunity from the claims of a
38 separate creditor of either settlor as if such property were
39 held outside the trust by the settlors as tenants by the
40 entirety, unless otherwise provided in writing by the
41 settlor or settlors who transferred such property to the
42 trust, and such property shall be treated for that purpose,
43 including without limitation, federal and state bankruptcy
44 laws, as tenants by entirety property[. Property held in a
45 qualified spousal trust];
46 (2) With the exception of any written financial
47 obligations, written guarantees, or secured or unsecured
48 transactions, executed by the settlors and held in a
49 qualified spousal trust, all property, including the
50 appreciation therein, shall continue to be immune and exempt
SB 988 3
51 from attachment during the life of the surviving settlor to
52 the extent the property was held in a qualified spousal
53 trust prior to the death of the first settlor and remains in
54 a qualified spousal trust; and
55 (3) Shall cease to receive immunity from the claims of
56 creditors upon the dissolution of marriage of the settlors
57 by a court.
58 4. As used in this section, "property" means any
59 interest in any type of property held in a qualified spousal
60 trust, the income thereon, and any property into which such
61 interest, proceeds, or income may be converted.
62 5. Upon the death of each settlor, all property held
63 by the trustee of the qualified spousal trust shall be
64 distributed as directed by the then current terms of the
65 governing instrument of such trust. Upon the death of the
66 first settlor to die, if immediately prior to death the
67 predeceased settlor's interest in the qualified spousal
68 trust was then held or deemed to be held in such settlor's
69 separate share, the property held in such settlor's separate
70 share may pass into an irrevocable trust for the benefit of
71 the surviving settlor or other beneficiary upon such terms
72 as the governing instrument shall direct, including without
73 limitation a spendthrift provision as provided in section
74 456.5-502. Property may be held in or transferred to a
75 settlor's joint or separate share of a trust by:
76 (a) Designation under the current terms of the
77 governing instrument of such trust; or
78 (b) Pursuant to the specified titling of property or
79 other designation that refers to such joint or separate
80 share of such trust; or
81 (c) Designation to the trustee as the owner as
82 provided in section 456.1-113.
SB 988 4
83 6. The respective rights of settlors who are married
84 to each other in any property for purposes of a dissolution
85 of the settlors' marriage shall not be affected or changed
86 by reason of the transfer of that property to, or its
87 subsequent administration as an asset of, a qualified
88 spousal trust during the marriage of the settlors, unless
89 both settlors expressly agree otherwise in writing.
90 7. No transfer to a qualified spousal trust shall
91 avoid or defeat the Missouri uniform fraudulent transfer act
92 in chapter 428.
93 8. This section shall apply to all trusts which
94 fulfill the criteria set forth in this section for a
95 qualified spousal trust regardless of whether such trust was
96 created before, on, or after August 28, 2011.
