3 follows:
1 92.114. 1. Notwithstanding any other provision of law
2 to the contrary, a city not within a county shall not
3 continue to impose or levy an earnings tax under sections
4 92.105 to 92.200 without complying with the provisions of
5 this section.
6 2. Beginning on September 30, 2024, the city shall
7 prepare a quarterly report stating the following:
8 (1) The total receipts from the earnings tax for the
9 quarter and for the calendar year-to-date;
10 (2) The receipts from the earnings tax, sorted by zip
11 code of the residence of the individual paying the tax, for
12 the quarter and the year-to-date;
13 (3) All refunds paid, sorted by zip code of the
14 residence of the individual paying the tax for the quarter
15 and the year-to-date; and
16 (4) All earnings tax payments remitted for work
17 performed or rendered through telecommuting or otherwise
18 performed or rendered remotely unless the location where

19 such remote work or services are performed is located in the
20 city.
21 3. The reports required by this section shall be open
22 records under chapter 610. The city shall post each report
23 required by this section on the main pages of the website of
24 the city and its collector of revenue, and the reports
25 posted shall be clearly identified in a manner designed to
26 make them easily accessible to the public. The city shall
27 submit each report required by this section to the state
28 auditor, to the secretary of the senate, to the chair of the
29 senate committee on appropriations, to the chief clerk of
30 the house of representatives, and to the chair of the house
31 of representatives budget committee.
32 4. For all tax returns filed on or after January 1,
33 2025, the term "work done or services performed or rendered

35 not include any work or services performed or rendered

46 of the Missouri supreme court rules, notwithstanding any
47 prior decision of a Missouri appellate court. Paying the
48 earnings tax under protest shall not be a prerequisite to
49 maintaining the cause of action permitted by this subsection.

56 where such remote work or services were performed is located
57 in the city. Such process shall include a sample
58 reimbursement form that is accessible to taxpayers on the
