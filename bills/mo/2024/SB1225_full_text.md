AN ACT
To repeal section 143.161, RSMo, and to enact in lieu thereof one new section relating to an
income tax exemption for certain dependents.
Be it enacted by the General Assembly of the State of Missouri, as follows:
1 Section A. Section 143.161, RSMo, is repealed and one new

2 December 31, 1997, a resident may deduct one thousand two
3 hundred dollars for each dependent for whom such resident is
4 entitled to a dependency exemption deduction for federal
5 income tax purposes, provided that the exemption amount as
6 defined under 26 U.S.C. Section 151 is not zero. In the
7 case of a dependent who has attained sixty-five years of age
8 on or before the last day of the taxable year, if such
