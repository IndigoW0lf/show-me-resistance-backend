14 (2) The veteran was discharged from military service
15 under honorable conditions.
16 3. All public institutions of higher education that
17 receive any state funds appropriated by the general assembly
18 shall limit the amount of tuition such institutions charge
19 to combat veterans to fifty dollars per credit hour, as long
20 as the veteran achieves and maintains a cumulative grade
21 point average of at least two and one-half on a four-point
22 scale, or its equivalent. The tuition limitation shall only
23 be applicable if the combat veteran is enrolled in a program
24 leading to a certificate, or an associate or baccalaureate
25 degree. The period during which a combat veteran is
26 eligible for a tuition limitation under this section shall
27 expire at the end of the ten-year period beginning on the

32 to combat veterans to no more than thirty percent of the
33 cost of tuition and fees. The tuition limitation shall only
34 be applicable if the combat veteran is enrolled in a program
35 leading to a graduate degree, including master and doctorate
36 degrees. For the purposes of this section, "graduate
37 degree" shall not be construed to include professional
38 degrees. Professional degrees may include but are not

44 5. Notwithstanding the provisions of section 313.835
45 to the contrary, all public institutions of higher education
SB 824 3
46 that receive any state funds appropriated by the general
47 assembly shall be deemed eligible to receive up to one
48 million dollars from the gaming commission fund annually to

50 to this section.
51 6. The coordinating board for higher education shall
52 ensure that all applicable institutions of higher education

57 financial assistance under any other federal or state
58 student aid program, public or private, the full amount of
59 such aid shall be reported to the board by the institution
60 and the veteran. The tuition limitation under this section
61 may, at the combat veteran's discretion, be provided before
62 all other federal and state aid for which the veteran is
63 eligible has been applied. The public institution of higher
64 education shall provide each combat veteran with written
65 notice of this option and maintain a copy signed by the
66 veteran in their official file.

70 included in each institution's request for appropriations to
71 the board for the following year. The board may include
72 this information in its appropriations recommendations to
73 the governor and the general assembly. The general assembly
74 may reimburse institutions for the cost of the waiver for
75 the previous year as part of the operating budget. Nothing
76 in this subsection shall be construed to deny a combat
SB 824 4
77 veteran a tuition limitation if the general assembly does
78 not appropriate money for reimbursement to an institution.
79 [8.] 9. Any rule or portion of a rule, as that term is
80 defined in section 536.010, that is created under the
81 authority delegated in this section shall become effective
82 only if it complies with and is subject to all of the
83 provisions of chapter 536 and, if applicable, section
84 536.028. This section and chapter 536 are nonseverable and
85 if any of the powers vested with the general assembly
86 pursuant to chapter 536 to review, to delay the effective
87 date, or to disapprove and annul a rule are subsequently
88 held unconstitutional, then the grant of rulemaking
89 authority and any rule proposed or adopted after August 28,
90 2008, shall be invalid and void.

292 shall be reviewed by video lottery game operators as
293 required by the commission for any violation of law, rules,
294 or regulations governing the conduct of video lottery games
295 and shall be made available to the commission upon request.

299 established commission procedures may be subject to an
300 administrative fine not to exceed five thousand dollars.

310 suspend such operator's or retailer's license for up to

315 results in the suspension or revocation of such operator's
316 or retailer's video lottery game license may appeal such
317 decision by filing an action in circuit court.

327 a conspicuous location where such video lottery game
328 terminals are located, containing in red lettering at least

330 number (1-888-BETSOFF) for the problem gambling helpline.
331 10. (1) Video lottery game operators shall pay the
332 commission thirty-six percent of the video lottery game
333 adjusted gross receipts, which shall be deposited in the
334 state lottery fund. The commission shall transfer, subject
335 to appropriation, the amount received from the operator from
336 the lottery fund to the lottery proceeds fund after
337 administrative expenses equal to four percent of the video
338 lottery game adjusted gross receipts are paid to the
339 municipality where a licensed video lottery game retailer
340 maintains an establishment licensed for the operation of
341 video lottery game terminals, or if such licensed
342 establishment is not located within the corporate boundaries
343 of a municipality, then to the county where such licensed
344 establishment is located to reimburse such municipality or
345 county for administrative expenses, and any administrative
SB 824 19
346 expenses for the commission that are not covered by
347 reimbursements from operators are deducted. Net proceeds

351 an emphasis on funding elementary and secondary education
352 student transportation costs and public institutions of

354 (2) Video lottery game operators shall retain the
355 remainder of the video lottery game adjusted gross receipts,
356 a portion of which shall be utilized to pay for
357 administrative expenses, which shall include the cost of the
358 centralized computer system, which cost shall be paid by
359 video lottery game operators in proportion to the number of
360 video lottery game terminals operated. Fifty percent of the
361 costs of the centralized computer system shall be
362 apportioned by the video lottery game operator among video
363 lottery game retailers to which it provides operations based
364 on the number of video lottery game terminals located at the
365 video lottery game retailer's establishment. The remainder
366 of adjusted gross receipts retained by the video lottery
367 game operator, after the cost of the centralized computer
368 system and administrative costs are paid and apportioned,
369 shall be divided equally between the video lottery game
370 operator and video lottery game retailer as agreed under
371 subsection 7 of this section.
372 11. All revenues received by the commission from
373 license fees and any reimbursements associated with the
374 administration of the provisions of sections 313.425 to
375 313.437, and all interest earned thereon, shall be
376 considered administrative expenses and shall be deposited in
377 the state lottery fund. Moneys deposited into the state
SB 824 20
378 lottery fund from license fees and any reimbursements of
379 commission administrative expenses to administer sections
380 313.425 to 313.437 shall be considered administrative
381 expenses and shall not be considered net proceeds pursuant
382 to Article III, Section 39(b) of the Missouri Constitution.
383 Subject to appropriation, up to one percent of such license
384 fees shall be deposited to the credit of the compulsive
385 gamblers fund created under section 313.842. The remainder
386 of the money deposited in the state lottery fund from video
387 lottery game license fees and any reimbursements of
388 commission administrative expenses to enforce sections
389 313.425 to 313.437 shall, subject to appropriation, be used
390 for administrative expenses associated with supervising and
391 enforcing the provisions of sections 313.425 to 313.437.
392 12. The commission shall contract with a state law
393 enforcement entity to assist in conducting background
394 investigations of video lottery game applicants, and for the
395 enforcement of sections 313.425 to 313.437.
396 13. A video lottery game licensee suspected of a
397 violation of sections 313.425 to 313.437 shall be afforded
398 an administrative hearing by the director of the state
399 lottery on the record, and an appeal of any action taken to
400 impose a fine on such licensee shall be to the commission.

402 the commission may be appealed by the video lottery game
403 licensee in a state court of competent jurisdiction.
404 14. The commission shall adopt rules for the
405 implementation of the video lottery game system authorized
406 under sections 313.425 to 313.437, including, but not
407 limited to, the placement of video lottery terminals within
408 a retail establishment and for the active oversight of the
409 conduct of video lottery games. Any rule or portion of a
SB 824 21
410 rule, as that term is defined in section 536.010, that is
411 created under the authority delegated in this section shall
412 become effective only if it complies with and is subject to
413 all of the provisions of chapter 536 and, if applicable,
414 section 536.028. This section and chapter 536 are
415 nonseverable and if any of the powers vested with the
416 general assembly pursuant to chapter 536 to review, to delay
417 the effective date, or to disapprove and annul a rule are
418 subsequently held unconstitutional, then the grant of
419 rulemaking authority and any rule proposed or adopted after
420 August 28, 2024, shall be invalid and void.

26 terminal operator, has paid the initial license fee, and
27 satisfactorily completed an initial criminal background
28 check may begin soliciting contracts with prospective video

7 2. The sale of lottery tickets, shares, or lottery
8 game plays using a video lottery game terminal under
9 sections 313.425 to 313.437 shall not constitute a valid

11 any license or permit issued under the provisions of chapter
12 311.

11 that disallows the licensing of video lottery game retailers

13 certified copy of such ordinance to the commission. Upon
14 receiving such notification and ordinance, the commission
15 shall not license video lottery game retailers within such
16 area covered by such municipal or county ordinance.
17 4. Any such municipality or county that has opted to
18 prohibit the use of video lottery game terminals to play
19 video lottery games may repeal such ordinance, and upon such
20 repeal and notification of such repeal, the commission may
21 license video lottery game retailers within such
22 municipality or county to conduct video lottery games. A
23 person or sales agent's operation, handling, leasing,
24 licensing, servicing, or placing of unregulated coin
25 operated amusement machines shall in no way prohibit or
26 prejudice that person or sales agent's participation in the
27 video lottery game program authorized pursuant to sections
28 313.425 to 313.437, nor shall it constitute a valid reason
29 to refuse to issue or renew or to revoke or suspend any
30 license or permit issued pursuant to sections 313.425 to
SB 824 24
31 313.437. The commission or political subdivisions shall in
