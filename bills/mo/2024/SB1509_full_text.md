AN ACT
To amend supreme court rule 52.08, relating to class actions.
Be it enacted by the General Assembly of the State of Missouri, as follows:
1 Section A. Supreme court rule 52.08 is amended, to read
2 as follows:
1 52.08. Class Actions
2 (a) Prerequisites [to a Class Action]. One or more
3 members of a class may sue or be sued as representative
4 parties on behalf of all members only if:
5 (1) the class is so numerous that joinder of all
6 members is impracticable[,];
7 (2) there are questions of law or fact common to the
8 class[,];
9 (3) the claims or defenses of the representative
10 parties are typical of the claims or defenses of the
11 class[,]; and
12 (4) the representative parties will fairly and
13 adequately protect the interests of the class.
14 (b) [Class Actions Maintainable] Types of Class
15 Actions. [An] A class action may be maintained [as a class
16 action if the prerequisites of subdivision (a) are] if Rule
17 52.08(a) is satisfied, and [in addition] if:
18 (1) [the prosecution of] prosecuting separate actions
19 by or against individual class members [of the class] would
20 create a risk of

SB 1509 2
21 (A) inconsistent or varying adjudications with respect
22 to individual class members [of the class which] that would
23 establish incompatible standards of conduct for the party
24 opposing the class[,]; or
25 (B) adjudications with respect to individual class
26 members [of the class which would] that, as a practical
27 matter, would be dispositive of the interests of the other
28 members not parties to the individual adjudications or would
29 substantially impair or impede their ability to protect
30 their interests; [or]
31 (2) the party opposing the class has acted or refused
32 to act on grounds that apply generally [applicable] to the
33 class, [thereby making appropriate] so that final injunctive
34 relief or corresponding declaratory relief [with respect to]
35 is appropriate respecting the class as a whole; or
36 (3) the court finds that the questions of law or fact
37 common to [the members of the] class members predominate
38 over any questions affecting only individual members, and
39 that a class action is superior to other available methods
40 for [the fair and efficient adjudication of] fairly and
41 efficiently adjudicating the controversy. The matters
42 pertinent to [the] these findings include:
43 (A) [the interest of members of] the class member's
44 interests in individually controlling the prosecution or
45 defense of separate actions;
46 (B) the extent and nature of any litigation concerning
47 the controversy already [commenced] begun by or against
48 [members of the] class members;
49 (C) the desirability or undesirability of concentrating
50 the litigation of the claims in the particular forum; and
51 (D) the likely difficulties [likely to be encountered
52 in the management of] in managing a class action.

188 (1) Notice to the Class.
189 (A) Information That Parties Shall Provide to the
190 Court. The parties shall provide the court with information
191 sufficient to enable it to determine whether to give notice
192 of the proposal to the class.
193 (B) Grounds for a Decision to Give Notice. The court
194 shall direct notice in a reasonable manner to all class
195 members who would be bound by the proposal if giving notice
196 is justified by the parties' showing that the court will

198 (i) approve the proposal under Rule 52.08(e)(2); and
199 (ii) certify the class for purposes of judgment on the
200 proposal.

204 adequate after considering whether:
205 (A) the class representatives and class counsel have
206 adequately represented the class;
207 (B) the proposal was negotiated at arm's length;
208 (C) the relief provided for the class is adequate,
209 taking into account:
SB 1509 8

212 distributing relief to the class, including the method of
213 processing class member claims;
214 (iii) the terms of any proposed award of attorney's
215 fees, including timing of payment; and

219 relative to each other.
220 (3) Identifying Agreements. The parties seeking
221 approval shall file a statement identifying any agreement
222 made in connection with the proposal.
223 (4) New Opportunity to be Excluded. If the class action
224 was previously certified pursuant to Rule 52.08(b)(3), the
225 court may refuse to approve a settlement unless it affords a
226 new opportunity to request exclusion to individual class
227 members who had an earlier opportunity to request exclusion
228 but did not do so.
229 (5) Class Member Objections.
230 (A) In General. Any class member may object to the
231 proposal if it requires court approval under this Rule
232 52.08(e). The objection shall state whether it applies only
233 to the objector, to a specific subset of the class, or to
234 the entire class, and also state with specificity the
235 grounds for the objection.
236 (B) Court Approval Required for Payment in Connection
237 with an Objection. Unless approved by the court after a
238 hearing, no payment or other consideration shall be provided
239 in connection with:

SB 1509 9
241 (ii) forgoing, dismissing, or abandoning an appeal from
242 a judgment approving the proposal.
243 (f) Appeals. An appellate court [may] shall permit an
244 appeal from an order of a circuit court granting or denying
245 class action certification under this Rule 52.08 [if a
246 petition is timely filed as provided in Rule 84.035. The
247 filing of a petition], but not from an order pursuant to
248 Rule 52.08(e)(1). An appeal shall not stay the proceedings
249 in the trial court unless the trial judge or the appellate
250 court so orders.
251 (g) Class Counsel.
252 (1) Appointing Class Counsel. Unless a statute provides
253 otherwise, a court that certifies a class shall appoint
254 class counsel. In appointing class counsel, the court:
255 (A) shall consider:
256 (i) the work counsel has done in identifying or
257 investigating potential claims in the action;
258 (ii) counsel's experience in handling class actions,
259 other complex litigation, and the types of claims asserted
260 in the action;
261 (iii) counsel's knowledge of the applicable law; and
262 (iv) the resources that counsel will commit to
263 representing the class;
264 (B) may consider any other matter pertinent to
265 counsel's ability to fairly and adequately represent the
266 interests of the class;
267 (C) may order potential class counsel to provide
268 information on any subject pertinent to the appointment and
269 to propose terms for attorney's fees and nontaxable costs;
270 (D) may include in the appointing order provisions
271 about the award of attorney's fees or nontaxable costs
272 pursuant to Rule 52.08(h); and
SB 1509 10
273 (E) may make further orders in connection with the
274 appointment.
275 (2) Standard for Appointing Class Counsel. When one
276 applicant seeks appointment as class counsel, the court may
277 appoint that applicant only if the applicant is adequate
278 pursuant to Rule 52.08(g)(1) and Rule 52.08(g)(4). If more
279 than one adequate applicant seeks appointment, the court
280 shall appoint the applicant best able to represent the
281 interests of the class.
282 (3) Interim Counsel. The court may designate interim
283 counsel to act on behalf of a putative class before
284 determining whether to certify the action as a class action.
285 (4) Duty of Class Counsel. Class counsel shall fairly
286 and adequately represent the interests of the class.
287 (h) Attorney's Fees and Nontaxable Costs. In a
288 certified class action, the court may award reasonable
289 attorney's fees and nontaxable costs that are authorized by
290 law or by the parties' agreement. The following procedures
291 apply:
292 (1) A claim for an award shall be made by motion at a
293 time the court sets. Notice of the motion shall be served on
294 all parties and, for motions by class counsel, directed to
295 class members in a reasonable manner.
296 (2) A class member, or a party from whom payment is
297 sought, may object to the motion.
298 (3) The court may hold a hearing and shall find the
299 facts and state its legal conclusions.
300 (4) The court may refer issues related to the amount of
301 the award to a special master.
302 (i) Legal Standard - Burden of Proof. The party seeking
303 class certification has the burden of proving every
304 requirement of this Rule 52.08 by a preponderance of the
SB 1509 11
305 evidence. The court shall not err in favor of certification,
306 but shall be satisfied, based on a rigorous analysis, that
307 the requirements of this Rule 52.08 have been met. This Rule
308 52.08 shall not be satisfied in whole or in part based on
309 allegations in the petition.
