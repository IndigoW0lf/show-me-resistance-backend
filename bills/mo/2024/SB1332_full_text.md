32 respectively; and provided further, that not more than one
33 of such persons shall be a teacher and one shall be a
34 nonteacher;
35 (4) One member, who shall be a school administrator,
36 to be elected for a term of four years by and from the

41 (5) Two trustees to be appointed for terms of four
42 years by the Missouri Public Charter School Association;
43 provided, however, that the terms of office of the first two
44 trustees so elected shall begin immediately upon their
45 election and shall expire two and four years from the date
46 of their election, respectively. The members of such board
47 of trustees appointed by the Missouri Public Charter School
48 Association shall have experience or qualifications relevant
49 to public charter schools and the retirement system. The
50 appointment of the trustees shall be subject to the same
SB 1332 3
51 rules and regulations applicable to other trustees,
52 including, but not limited to, taking an oath of office as
53 provided in subsection 5 of this section.
54 2. If a vacancy occurs in the office of trustee, the
55 vacancy shall be filled for the unexpired term in the same
56 manner as the office was previously filled. No vacancy or
57 vacancies on the board of trustees shall impair the power of
58 the remaining trustees to administer the retirement system
59 pending the filling of such vacancies.
60 3. In the event of a lapse of a school district's
61 corporate organization as described in subsections 1 and 4
62 of section 162.081, or for any other reason, the general
63 administration and the responsibility for the proper
64 operation of the retirement system shall continue to be
65 fully vested in the trustees then currently serving and such
66 trustees shall continue to serve and be elected in the same
67 manner as set forth in this statute as if no lapse had
68 occurred, except that in the event of vacancies occurring in
69 the office of trustees appointed by the board of education
70 prior to the lapse, the board of trustees shall appoint a
71 qualified person or persons to fill such vacancy or
72 vacancies for terms of up to four years.
73 4. Trustees shall serve without compensation, and any
74 trustee shall be reimbursed from the expense fund for all
75 necessary expenses which the trustee may incur through
76 service on the board of trustees.
77 5. Each trustee shall, within ten days after such
78 trustee's appointment or election, take an oath of office
79 before the clerk of the circuit court of the judicial
80 circuit in which the school district is located that, so far
81 as it devolves upon the trustee, the trustee will diligently
82 and honestly administer the affairs of the board of trustees
SB 1332 4
83 and that the trustee will not knowingly violate or willingly
84 permit to be violated any of the provisions of the law
85 applicable to the retirement system. Such oath shall be
86 subscribed to by the trustee making it and filed in the
87 office of the clerk of the circuit court.
88 6. The circuit court of the judicial circuit in which
89 the school district is located shall have jurisdiction over
90 the members of the board of trustees to require them to
91 account for their official conduct in the management and
92 disposition of the funds and property committed to their
93 charge; to order, decree and compel payment by them to the
94 public school retirement system of their school district of
95 all sums of money, and of the value of all property which
96 may have been improperly retained by them, or transferred to
97 others, or which may have been lost or wasted by any
98 violation of their duties or abuse of their powers as such
99 members of such board; to remove any such member upon proof
100 that the trustee has abused the trustee's trust or has
101 violated the duties of the trustee's office; to restrain and
102 prevent any alienation or disposition of property of such
103 public school retirement system by the members, in cases
104 where it may be threatened, or there is good reason to
105 apprehend that it is intended to be made in fraud of the
106 rights and interests of such public school retirement
107 system. The jurisdiction conferred by sections 169.410 to
108 169.540 shall be exercised as in ordinary cases upon
109 petition, filed by the board of education of such school
110 district, or by any two members of the board of trustees.
111 Such petition shall be heard in a summary manner after ten
112 days' notice in writing to the member complained of, and an
113 appeal shall lie from the judgment of the circuit court as
114 in other causes and be speedily determined, but such appeal
SB 1332 5
115 shall not operate under any condition as a supersedeas of a
116 judgment of removal from office.

118 board of trustees. Six votes shall be necessary for a

126 of retirement system assets, and for the transaction of the
127 retirement system's business.
128 9. The board of trustees shall elect from its
129 membership a chairman and shall, by majority vote of its
130 members, appoint a secretary, who may be, but need not be,

133 of the retirement system. It shall also engage an
134 investment counselor who shall be experienced in the
135 investment of moneys to advise the trustees on investments
136 of the retirement system. The compensation of all persons
137 engaged by the board of trustees and all other expenses of
138 the board necessary for the operation of the retirement
139 system shall be paid at such rates and in such amounts as
140 the board of trustees shall approve.

184 the retirement system, and taking into account the results
185 of such investigation of the experience, the board of
186 trustees shall adopt for the retirement system such
187 actuarial assumptions as shall be deemed necessary.
188 16. On the basis of such actuarial assumptions as the

191 of the retirement system.
192 17. On the basis of the valuation the board of
