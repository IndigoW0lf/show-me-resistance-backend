60 3. For all tax years beginning on or after January 1,

67 than one hundred dollars and shall not exceed two hundred
68 thousand dollars per tax year.
69 (1) A child care provider or intermediary shall apply

76 that have entered into an agreement with the department may
77 receive a tax credit pursuant to this section.
78 (2) The child care provider or intermediary receiving
79 a contribution shall, within sixty days of the date it

97 contribution solely to promote child care and, in the case
98 of an intermediary, that the intermediary will distribute
99 the contribution and any income thereon in full to one or
100 more child care providers within two years of receipt.
101 (3) The failure of the child care provider or
102 intermediary to timely issue the contribution verification
103 to the taxpayer or file it with the department shall entitle
104 the taxpayer to a refund of the contribution from the child
105 care provider or intermediary.
106 4. A contribution, whether received from the taxpayer
107 claiming the tax credit pursuant to this section or from an
108 intermediary, is eligible when:
109 (1) The contribution is used directly by the child
110 care provider to promote child care for children twelve
111 years of age or younger, including by acquiring or improving
112 child care facilities, equipment, or services, staff
113 salaries, staff training, or improving the quality of child
114 care;
SB 742 5
115 (2) The contribution, if made to an intermediary, is
116 distributed in full by the intermediary within two years of
117 receipt to one or more child care providers for the sole
118 purpose of promoting child care for children twelve years of
119 age or younger;
120 (3) The contribution is made to a child care provider
121 or intermediary in which the taxpayer or a person related to
122 the taxpayer does not have a direct financial interest;
123 (4) The contribution made to an intermediary is not
124 designated for a child care provider in which the taxpayer
125 or a person related to the taxpayer has a direct financial
126 interest; and
127 (5) The contribution is not made in exchange for care
128 of a child or children, unless the contribution is made by
129 an employer in purchasing child care for the children of the
130 employer's employees.
131 5. A child care provider or intermediary that uses the
132 contribution for an ineligible purpose shall repay to the
133 department the value of the tax credit for the contribution
134 amount used for such ineligible purpose. An intermediary
135 that accepts a contribution and issues a taxpayer a
136 contribution verification is itself permanently ineligible
137 to claim or redeem a tax credit pursuant to this section.
138 6. (1) The tax credits authorized by this section
139 shall not be refundable and shall not be transferred, sold,
140 or otherwise conveyed. Any amount of approved tax credits
141 that a taxpayer is prohibited by this subsection from using
142 for the tax year in which the credit is first claimed may be
143 carried forward to the taxpayer's subsequent tax year for up
144 to six succeeding tax years.
145 (2) In the case of a taxpayer that has or elects pass-
146 through taxation pursuant to federal income tax law, the tax
SB 742 6
147 credits issued pursuant to this section shall be apportioned
148 in proportion to the share of ownership of the taxpayer on
149 the last day of the taxpayer's tax period for which such tax
150 credits will be issued, to the following:
151 (a) The shareholders of the S corporation;
152 (b) The partners in a partnership; or
153 (c) The members of a limited liability company that
154 has or elects pass-through taxation pursuant to federal
155 income tax law.
156 (3) A taxpayer shall not claim a tax credit pursuant
157 to this section and a tax credit pursuant to section
158 135.1325 for the same contribution or expenditure.
159 7. Notwithstanding any provision of subsection 6 of
160 this section to the contrary, a taxpayer that is exempt,
161 under 26 U.S.C. Section 501(c)(3), and any amendments
162 thereto, from all or part of the federal income tax shall be
163 eligible for a refund of its tax credit issued under this
164 section, without regard to whether it has incurred any state
165 tax liability. Such exempt taxpayer may claim a refund of
166 the tax credit on its tax return required to be filed under
167 the provisions of chapter 143, exclusive of the return for
168 the withholding of tax under sections 143.191 to 143.265.
169 If such exempt taxpayer is not required to file a tax return
170 under the provisions of chapter 143, the exempt taxpayer may
171 claim a refund of the tax credit on a refund claim form
172 prescribed by the department of revenue. The department of
173 revenue shall prescribe such forms, instructions, and rules
174 as it deems appropriate to carry out the provisions of this
175 subsection.
176 8. (1) The amount of tax credits authorized pursuant
177 to this section shall not exceed twenty million dollars for
178 each calendar year. The department shall approve tax credit
SB 742 7
179 applications on a first-come, first-served basis until the
180 tax credit authorization limit is reached for the calendar
181 year. A taxpayer shall apply to the department for the
182 child care contribution tax credit by submitting a copy of
183 the contribution verification provided by a child care
184 provider or intermediary to such taxpayer. Upon receipt of
185 such contribution verification, the department shall issue a
186 tax credit certificate to the taxpayer.
187 (2) If the maximum amount of tax credits allowed in
188 any calendar year as provided pursuant to subdivision (1) of
189 this subsection is authorized, the maximum amount of tax
190 credits allowed pursuant to subdivision (1) of this
191 subsection shall be increased by fifteen percent, provided
192 that all such increases in the allowable amount of tax
193 credits shall be reserved for contributions made to child
194 care providers located in a child care desert. The director
195 of the department shall publish such adjusted amount.
196 9. The tax credits allowed under this section shall be
197 considered a domestic and social tax credit under
198 subdivision (5) of subsection 2 of section 135.800.
199 10. All action and communication undertaken or
200 required under this section shall be exempt from section
201 105.1500.
202 11. The department may promulgate rules to implement
203 and administer the provisions of this section. Any rule or
204 portion of a rule, as that term is defined in section
205 536.010, that is created pursuant to the authority delegated
206 in this section shall become effective only if it complies
207 with and is subject to all of the provisions of chapter 536
208 and, if applicable, section 536.028. This section and
209 chapter 536 are nonseverable and if any of the powers vested
210 with the general assembly pursuant to chapter 536 to review,
SB 742 8
211 to delay the effective date, or to disapprove and annul a
212 rule are subsequently held unconstitutional, then the grant
213 of rulemaking authority and any rule proposed or adopted
214 after August 28, 2024, shall be invalid and void.
215 12. Pursuant to section 23.253 of the Missouri sunset

224 authorized under this act shall automatically sunset six
225 years after the effective date of the reauthorization of
226 this section; and

228 construed to limit or in any way impair the department of

231 section expires or a taxpayer's ability to redeem such tax
232 credits.

67 3. For all tax years beginning on or after January 1,
68 2025, a child care provider with three or more employees may
69 claim a tax credit authorized in this section in an amount
70 equal to the child care provider's eligible employer
71 withholding tax, and may also claim a tax credit in an
72 amount up to thirty percent of the child care provider's
73 capital expenditures. No tax credit for capital
74 expenditures shall be allowed if the capital expenditures
75 are less than one thousand dollars. The amount of any tax
76 credit issued under this section shall not exceed two
77 hundred thousand dollars per child care provider per tax
78 year.
79 4. To claim a tax credit authorized pursuant to this
80 section, a child care provider shall submit to the
81 department, for preliminary approval, an application for the
82 tax credit on a form provided by the department and at such
83 times as the department may require. If the child care
84 provider is applying for a tax credit for capital
85 expenditures, the child care provider shall present proof
86 acceptable to the department that the child care provider's
87 capital expenditures satisfy the requirements of subdivision
88 (1) of subsection 2 of this section. Upon final approval of
89 an application, the department shall issue the child care
90 provider a certificate of tax credit.
91 5. (1) The tax credits authorized by this section
92 shall not be refundable and shall not be transferred, sold,
93 assigned, or otherwise conveyed. Any amount of credit that
94 exceeds the child care provider's state tax liability for
95 the tax year for which the tax credit is issued may be
96 carried forward to the child care provider's subsequent tax
97 year for up to six succeeding tax years.
SB 742 18
98 (2) In the case of a taxpayer that has or elects pass-
99 through taxation pursuant to federal income tax law, the tax
100 credits issued pursuant to this section shall be apportioned
101 in proportion to the share of ownership of the taxpayer on
102 the last day of the taxpayer's tax period for which such tax
103 credits will be issued, to the following:
104 (a) The shareholders of the S corporation;
105 (b) The partners in a partnership; or
106 (c) The members of a limited liability company that
107 has or elects pass-through taxation pursuant to federal
108 income tax law.
109 (3) A taxpayer shall not claim a tax credit pursuant
110 to this section and a tax credit pursuant to section
111 135.1325 for the same contribution or expenditure.
112 6. Notwithstanding any provision of subsection 5 of
113 this section to the contrary, a child care provider that is
114 exempt, under 26 U.S.C. Section 501(c)(3), and any
115 amendments thereto, from all or part of the federal income
116 tax shall be eligible for a refund of its tax credit issued
117 under this section, without regard to whether it has
118 incurred any state tax liability. Such exempt child care
119 provider may claim a refund of the tax credit on its tax
120 return required to be filed under the provisions of chapter
121 143, exclusive of the return for the withholding of tax
122 under sections 143.191 to 143.265. If such exempt child
123 care provider is not required to file a tax return under the
124 provisions of chapter 143, the exempt child care provider
125 may claim a refund of the tax credit on a refund claim form
126 prescribed by the department of revenue. The department of
127 revenue shall prescribe such forms, instructions, and rules
128 as it deems appropriate to carry out the provisions of this
129 subsection.
SB 742 19
130 7. (1) The amount of tax credits authorized pursuant
131 to this section shall not exceed twenty million dollars for
132 each calendar year. The department shall approve tax credit
133 applications on a first-come, first-served basis until the
134 tax credit authorization limit is reached for the calendar
135 year.
136 (2) If the maximum amount of tax credits allowed in
137 any calendar year as provided pursuant to subdivision (1) of
138 this subsection is authorized, the maximum amount of tax
139 credits allowed pursuant to subdivision (1) of this
140 subsection shall be increased by fifteen percent, provided
141 that all such increases in the allowable amount of tax
142 credits shall be reserved for child care providers located
143 in a child care desert. The director of the department
144 shall publish such adjusted amount.
145 8. The tax credit authorized by this section shall be
146 considered a domestic and social tax credit under
147 subdivision (5) of subsection 2 of section 135.800.
148 9. All action and communication undertaken or required
149 with respect to this section shall be exempt from section
150 105.1500. Notwithstanding section 32.057 or any other tax
151 confidentiality law to the contrary, the department of
152 revenue may disclose tax information to the department for
153 the purpose of the verification of a child care provider's
154 eligible employer withholding tax under this section.
155 10. The department may promulgate rules and adopt
156 statements of policy, procedures, forms and guidelines to
157 implement and administer the provisions of this section.
158 Any rule or portion of a rule, as that term is defined in
159 section 536.010, that is created pursuant to the authority
160 delegated in this section shall become effective only if it
161 complies with and is subject to all of the provisions of
SB 742 20
162 chapter 536 and, if applicable, section 536.028. This
163 section and chapter 536 are nonseverable and if any of the
164 powers vested with the general assembly pursuant to chapter
165 536 to review, to delay the effective date, or to disapprove
166 and annul a rule are subsequently held unconstitutional,
167 then the grant of rulemaking authority and any rule proposed
168 or adopted after August 28, 2024, shall be invalid and void.
169 11. Pursuant to section 23.253 of the Missouri sunset
170 act:
171 (1) The program authorized under this section shall
172 expire on December 31, 2030, unless reauthorized by the
173 general assembly;
174 (2) The act shall terminate on September first of the
175 calendar year immediately following the calendar year in
176 which the program authorized under this section is sunset;
177 (3) If such program is reauthorized, the program
178 authorized under this section shall automatically sunset six
179 years after the effective date of the reauthorization of
180 this section; and
181 (4) The provisions of this subsection shall not be
182 construed to limit or in any way impair the department of
183 revenue's ability to redeem tax credits authorized on or
184 before the date the program authorized pursuant to this
185 section expires or a taxpayer's ability to redeem such tax
186 credits.
