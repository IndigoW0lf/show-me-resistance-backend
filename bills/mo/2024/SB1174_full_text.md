40 The minimum amount of any tax credit issued shall not be

63 credits issued. In the event tax credits claimed under one
64 agency do not total the allocated amount for that agency,
65 the unused portion for that agency will be made available to
66 the remaining agencies equally. In the event the total
67 amount of tax credits claimed for any one agency exceeds the
68 amount available for that agency, the amount redeemed shall
69 and will be apportioned equally to all eligible taxpayers
70 claiming the credit under that agency.]
71 4. Prior to December thirty-first of each year, each
72 qualified agency shall apply to the department of social
73 services in order to verify their qualified agency status.
74 Upon a determination that the agency is eligible to be a
75 qualified agency, the department of social services shall
76 provide a letter of eligibility to such agency. No later

85 return.
86 5. Any amount of tax credit which exceeds the tax due
87 or which is applied for and otherwise eligible for issuance
88 but not issued shall not be refunded but may be carried over
89 to any subsequent tax year, not to exceed a total of five
90 years.
91 6. Tax credits may not be assigned, transferred or
92 sold.
93 7. [(1) In the event a credit denial, due to lack of
94 available funds, causes a balance-due notice to be generated
95 by the department of revenue, or any other redeeming agency,
96 the taxpayer will not be held liable for any penalty or
97 interest, provided the balance is paid, or approved payment
98 arrangements have been made, within sixty days from the
99 notice of denial.
100 (2) In the event the balance is not paid within sixty
101 days from the notice of denial, the remaining balance shall
102 be due and payable under the provisions of chapter 143.
103 8.] The department may promulgate such rules or
104 regulations as are necessary to administer the provisions of
105 this section. Any rule or portion of a rule, as that term
106 is defined in section 536.010, that is created under the
107 authority delegated in this section shall become effective
108 only if it complies with and is subject to all of the
109 provisions of chapter 536 and, if applicable, section
110 536.028. This section and chapter 536 are nonseverable and
111 if any of the powers vested with the general assembly
112 pursuant to chapter 536 to review, to delay the effective
113 date, or to disapprove and annul a rule are subsequently
SB 1174 5
114 held unconstitutional, then the grant of rulemaking
115 authority and any rule proposed or adopted after August 28,
116 2013, shall be invalid and void.
117 [9.] 8. Pursuant to section 23.253, of the Missouri
118 sunset act:
119 (1) The program authorized under this section shall be
120 reauthorized as of [December 31, 2019,] August 28, 2024, and
121 shall expire on December 31, [2025] 2030, unless
122 reauthorized by the general assembly; and
123 (2) This section shall terminate on September first of
124 the calendar year immediately following the calendar year in
125 which the program authorized under this section is sunset;
126 and
127 (3) The provisions of this subsection shall not be
128 construed to limit or in any way impair the department's
129 ability to redeem tax credits authorized on or before the
130 date the program authorized under this section expires or a
131 taxpayer's ability to redeem such credits.
132 [10.] 9. Beginning on March 29, 2013, any verified
133 contribution to a qualified agency made on or after January
134 1, 2013, shall be eligible for tax credits as provided by
