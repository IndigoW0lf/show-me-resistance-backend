AN ACT
To amend chapter 324, RSMo, by adding thereto one new section relating to professional licensing.
Be it enacted by the General Assembly of the State of Missouri, as follows:
1 Section A. Chapter 324, RSMo, is amended by adding thereto
2 one new section, to be known as section 324.004, to read as
3 follows:
1 324.004. 1. Any person who has at least three years
2 of work experience in an occupation or profession in another
3 state, the District of Columbia, or any combination of such
4 jurisdictions, and whose work experience involved the
5 practice of an occupation or profession for which a license
6 is not required in the jurisdiction or jurisdictions in
7 which the person worked but is required in this state, may
8 submit an application for a one-time nonrenewable two-year
9 temporary license in this state in the occupation or
10 profession, along with proof of at least three years of work
11 experience in the occupation or profession and a fee as set
12 by regulation of the oversight body, to the relevant
13 oversight body in this state. The oversight body shall make
14 a determination of qualification within forty-five days of
15 receiving a completed application. As used in this section,
16 "oversight body" shall mean any board, department, agency,
17 or office of a jurisdiction that issues occupational or
18 professional licenses.
SB 817 2
19 2. The oversight body shall require an applicant under
20 this section to take and pass the profession-specific
21 examination required for licensure by those applying
22 pursuant to the provisions of the oversight body's statutory
23 and regulatory authority. An oversight body that
24 administers an examination on the laws of this state as part
25 of its licensing application requirements may require an
26 applicant under this section to take and pass an examination
27 specific to the laws of this state.
28 3. The oversight body shall not issue a one-time
29 nonrenewable temporary license to any applicant described in
30 subsection 1 of this section who has had any license in the
31 relevant occupation or profession revoked by an oversight
32 body outside of this state, who is currently under
33 investigation, who has a complaint pending, or who is
34 currently under disciplinary action.
35 4. Applicants for the one-time nonrenewable temporary
36 license shall be citizens of the United States and shall
37 submit legal proof of citizenship as part of the application.
38 5. The provisions of this section shall not apply to
39 the following:
40 (1) Any occupation whose oversight body has entered
41 into a licensing compact with another state for the
42 regulation of practice under the oversight body's
43 jurisdiction. The provisions of this section shall not be
44 construed to alter the authority granted by, or any
45 requirements promulgated pursuant to, any
46 interjurisdictional or interstate compacts adopted by this
47 state or any reciprocity agreements with other states, and
48 whenever possible the provisions of this section shall be
49 interpreted so as to imply no conflict between it and any
50 compact or any reciprocity agreement with other states;
SB 817 3
51 (2) Any occupation set forth in subsection 6 of
52 section 290.257 or any electrical contractor licensed under
53 sections 324.900 to 324.945;
54 (3) Any occupation whose regulators or licensees are
55 required to comply with specific federal statutory,
56 regulatory, and administrative requirements in order to
57 practice in Missouri; or
58 (4) Assistant physicians licensed under chapter 334.
59 6. The one-time nonrenewable temporary license shall
60 expire after two years. Upon expiration, the individual
61 shall be required to apply for a permanent license in
62 accordance with the license requirements for the occupation
63 for which he or she held the temporary license.
64 7. Notwithstanding any other provision of law to the
65 contrary, a license issued under this section shall be valid
66 only in this state and shall not make a licensee eligible to
67 be part of an interstate compact. An applicant who is
68 licensed in another state pursuant to an interstate compact
69 shall not be eligible for licensure by an oversight body
70 under the provisions of this section.
71 8. Notwithstanding any other provision of law to the
72 contrary, a license issued under this section shall be valid
73 only in this state and shall not make a licensee eligible to
74 obtain a license by reciprocity in another state.
75 9. The division of professional registration may
76 promulgate rules to implement the provisions of this
77 section. Any rule or portion of a rule, as that term is
78 defined in section 536.010, that is created under the
79 authority delegated in this section shall become effective
80 only if it complies with and is subject to all of the
81 provisions of chapter 536 and, if applicable, section
82 536.028. This section and chapter 536 are nonseverable and
SB 817 4
83 if any of the powers vested with the general assembly
84 pursuant to chapter 536 to review, to delay the effective
85 date, or to disapprove and annul a rule are subsequently
86 held unconstitutional, then the grant of rulemaking
87 authority and any rule proposed or adopted after August 28,
88 2024, shall be invalid and void.
