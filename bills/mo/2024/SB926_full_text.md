2 general elections where candidates for federal or statewide
3 offices are nominated or elected and any election where
4 statewide issue or issues are submitted to the voters] any
5 public election.
6 2. (1) A voter claiming to be properly registered in
7 the jurisdiction of the election authority and eligible to
8 vote in an election, but whose eligibility at that precinct
9 cannot be immediately established upon examination of the
10 precinct register, shall be entitled to vote a provisional
11 ballot after providing a form of personal identification
12 required pursuant to section 115.427 or upon executing an
13 affidavit under section 115.427, or may vote at a central
14 polling place as established in section 115.115 where the
15 voter may vote his or her appropriate ballot for his or her
16 precinct of residence upon verification of eligibility or
SB 926 11
17 vote a provisional ballot if eligibility cannot be
18 determined. The provisional ballot provided to a voter
19 under this section shall be the ballot provided to a
20 resident of the voter's precinct determined by reference to
21 the affidavit provided for in this section. If the voter
22 declares that the voter is eligible to vote and the election
23 authority determines that the voter is eligible to vote at
24 another polling place, the voter shall be directed to the
25 correct polling place or a central polling place as
26 established by the election authority pursuant to subsection
27 5 of section 115.115. If the voter refuses to go to the
28 correct polling place or a central polling place, the voter
29 shall be permitted to vote a provisional ballot at the
30 incorrect polling place, but such ballot shall not be
31 counted if the voter was not eligible to vote at that
32 polling place.
33 (2) The following steps shall be taken to establish a
34 voter's eligibility to vote at a polling place:
35 (a) The election judge shall examine the precinct
36 register as provided in section 115.425. If the voter is
37 registered and eligible to vote at the polling place, the
38 voter shall receive a regular ballot;
39 (b) If the voter's eligibility cannot be immediately
40 established by examining the precinct register, the election
41 judge shall contact the election authority. If the election
42 authority cannot immediately establish that the voter is
43 registered and eligible to vote at the polling place upon
44 examination of the Missouri voter registration system, or if
45 the election judge is unable to make contact with the
46 election authority immediately, the voter shall be notified
47 that the voter is entitled to a provisional ballot.
SB 926 12
48 (3) The voter shall have the duty to appear and vote
49 at the correct polling place. If an election judge
50 determines that the voter is not eligible to vote at the
51 polling place at which a voter presents himself or herself,
52 and if the voter appears to be eligible to vote at another
53 polling place, the voter shall be informed that he or she
54 may cast a provisional ballot at the current polling place
55 or may travel to the correct polling place or a central
56 polling place, as established by the election authority
57 under subsection 5 of section 115.115, where the voter may
58 cast a regular ballot or provisional ballot if the voter's
59 eligibility still cannot be determined. Provisional ballots
60 cast at a polling place shall be counted only if the voter
61 was eligible to vote at such polling place as provided in
62 subsection 5 of this section.
63 (4) For a voter requesting an absentee ballot in
64 person, such voter shall be entitled to cast a provisional
65 ballot when the voter's eligibility cannot be immediately
66 established upon examination of the precinct registers or
67 the Missouri voter registration system.
68 (5) Prior to accepting any provisional ballot at the
69 polling place, the election judges shall determine that the
70 information provided on the provisional ballot envelope by
71 the provisional voter is consistent with the identification
72 provided by such person under section 115.427.
73 3. (1) No person shall be entitled to receive a
74 provisional ballot until such person has completed a
75 provisional ballot affidavit on the provisional ballot
76 envelope.
77 (2) The secretary of state shall produce appropriate
78 sizes of provisional ballot envelopes and distribute them to
79 each election authority according to their tabulating
SB 926 13
80 system. All provisional ballot envelopes shall be printed
81 on a distinguishable color of paper that is different from
82 the color of the regular ballot. The provisional ballot
83 envelope shall be in the form required by subsection 4 of
84 this section. All provisional ballots shall be marked with
85 a conspicuous stamp or other distinguishing mark that makes
86 them readily distinguishable from the regular ballots.
87 (3) Once voted, the provisional ballot shall be placed
88 and sealed in a provisional ballot envelope.
89 4. The provisional ballot in its envelope shall be
90 deposited in the ballot box. The provisional ballot
91 envelope shall be completed by the voter for use in
92 determining eligibility. The provisional ballot envelope
93 specified in this section shall contain a voter's
94 certificate which shall be in substantially the following
95 form:
96 STATE OF ______
97 COUNTY OF ______
98 I do solemnly swear (or affirm) that my name is
99 ______; that my date of birth is ______; that the
100 last four digits of my Social Security Number are
101 ______; that I am registered to vote in ______
102 County or City (if a City not within a County),
103 Missouri; that I am a qualified voter of said
104 County (or City not within a County); that I am
105 eligible to vote at this polling place; and that I
106 have not voted in this election.
107 I understand that if the above-provided
108 information is not correct and the election
109 authority determines that I am not registered and
110 eligible to vote, my vote will not be counted. I
111 further understand that knowingly providing false
112 information is a violation of law and subjects me
113 to possible criminal prosecution.

148 election authority from the polling places, the receiving

150 of the ballots and place the sealed provisional ballot
151 envelopes in a separate container. Teams of election
152 authority employees or teams of election judges with each
153 team consisting of one member of each major political party
154 shall photocopy each provisional ballot envelope, such
155 photocopy to be used by the election authority to determine
156 provisional voter eligibility. The sealed provisional
157 ballot envelopes shall be placed by the team in a sealed
158 container and shall remain therein until tabulation.
159 (3) To determine whether a provisional ballot is valid
160 and entitled to be counted, the election authority shall
161 examine its records and verify that the provisional voter is
162 properly registered and eligible to vote in the election.

168 vote in the election.
169 (4) If the election authority determines that the
170 provisional voter is registered and eligible to vote in the
171 election, the election authority shall provide documentation

182 ballot identification number and a notation marking it as
183 accepted.
184 (6) If the election authority determines that the
185 provisional voter is not registered or eligible to vote in
186 the election, the election authority shall provide
187 documentation verifying the voter's ineligibility. Such
188 documentation shall be noted on the copy of the provisional
189 ballot envelope and shall contain substantially the
190 following information:
191 (a) The name of the provisional voter;
192 (b) The name of the reviewer;
193 (c) The date and time;
194 (d) A description of why the voter is ineligible.

201 registration. The actual provisional ballot envelope shall

204 record keeping.

205 6. All provisional ballots cast by voters whose
206 eligibility has been verified as provided in this section
207 shall be counted in accordance with the rules governing
208 ballot tabulation. Provisional ballots shall not be counted
209 until all provisional ballots are determined either eligible
210 or ineligible and all provisional ballots must be processed
211 before the election is certified. The provisional ballot
212 shall be counted only if the election authority determines
213 that the voter is registered and eligible to vote.
214 Provisional ballots voted in the wrong polling place shall
215 not be counted. If the voter is not registered but is
216 qualified to register for future elections, the affidavit
