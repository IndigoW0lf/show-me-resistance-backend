64 pursuant to chapter 536 to review, to delay the effective
65 date or to disapprove and annul a rule are subsequently held
66 unconstitutional, then the grant of rulemaking authority and
67 any rule proposed or adopted after August 28, 2002, shall be
68 invalid and void.

5 2. (1) A voter claiming to be properly registered in
6 the jurisdiction of the election authority and eligible to
7 vote in an election, but whose eligibility at that precinct
8 cannot be immediately established upon examination of the
9 precinct register, shall be entitled to vote a provisional
10 ballot after providing a form of personal identification
11 required pursuant to section 115.427 or upon executing an
12 affidavit under section 115.427, or may vote at a central
SB 917 19
13 polling place as established in section 115.115 where the
14 voter may vote his or her appropriate ballot for his or her
15 precinct of residence upon verification of eligibility or
16 vote a provisional ballot if eligibility cannot be
17 determined. The provisional ballot provided to a voter
18 under this section shall be the ballot provided to a
19 resident of the voter's precinct determined by reference to
20 the affidavit provided for in this section. If the voter
21 declares that the voter is eligible to vote and the election
22 authority determines that the voter is eligible to vote at
23 another polling place, the voter shall be directed to the
24 correct polling place or a central polling place as
25 established by the election authority pursuant to subsection
26 5 of section 115.115. If the voter refuses to go to the
27 correct polling place or a central polling place, the voter
28 shall be permitted to vote a provisional ballot at the
29 incorrect polling place, but such ballot shall not be
30 counted if the voter was not eligible to vote at that
31 polling place.
32 (2) The following steps shall be taken to establish a
33 voter's eligibility to vote at a polling place:
34 (a) The election judge shall examine the precinct
35 register as provided in section 115.425. If the voter is
36 registered and eligible to vote at the polling place, the
37 voter shall receive a regular ballot;
38 (b) If the voter's eligibility cannot be immediately
39 established by examining the precinct register, the election
40 judge shall contact the election authority. If the election
41 authority cannot immediately establish that the voter is
42 registered and eligible to vote at the polling place upon
43 examination of the Missouri voter registration system, or if
44 the election judge is unable to make contact with the
SB 917 20
45 election authority immediately, the voter shall be notified
46 that the voter is entitled to a provisional ballot.
47 (3) The voter shall have the duty to appear and vote
48 at the correct polling place. If an election judge
49 determines that the voter is not eligible to vote at the
50 polling place at which a voter presents himself or herself,
51 and if the voter appears to be eligible to vote at another
52 polling place, the voter shall be informed that he or she
53 may cast a provisional ballot at the current polling place
54 or may travel to the correct polling place or a central
55 polling place, as established by the election authority
56 under subsection 5 of section 115.115, where the voter may
57 cast a regular ballot or provisional ballot if the voter's
58 eligibility still cannot be determined. Provisional ballots
59 cast at a polling place shall be counted only if the voter
60 was eligible to vote at such polling place as provided in
61 subsection 5 of this section.
62 (4) For a voter requesting an absentee ballot in
63 person, such voter shall be entitled to cast a provisional
64 ballot when the voter's eligibility cannot be immediately
65 established upon examination of the precinct registers or
66 the Missouri voter registration system.
67 (5) Prior to accepting any provisional ballot at the
68 polling place, the election judges shall determine that the
69 information provided on the provisional ballot envelope by
70 the provisional voter is consistent with the identification
71 provided by such person under section 115.427.
72 3. (1) No person shall be entitled to receive a
73 provisional ballot until such person has completed a
74 provisional ballot affidavit on the provisional ballot
75 envelope.
SB 917 21
76 (2) The secretary of state shall produce appropriate
77 sizes of provisional ballot envelopes and distribute them to
78 each election authority according to their tabulating
79 system. All provisional ballot envelopes shall be printed
80 on a distinguishable color of paper that is different from
81 the color of the regular ballot. The provisional ballot
82 envelope shall be in the form required by subsection 4 of
83 this section. All provisional ballots shall be marked with
84 a conspicuous stamp or other distinguishing mark that makes
85 them readily distinguishable from the regular ballots.
86 (3) Once voted, the provisional ballot shall be placed
87 and sealed in a provisional ballot envelope.
88 4. The provisional ballot in its envelope shall be
89 deposited in the ballot box. The provisional ballot
90 envelope shall be completed by the voter for use in
91 determining eligibility. The provisional ballot envelope
92 specified in this section shall contain a voter's
93 certificate which shall be in substantially the following
94 form:
95 STATE OF ______
96 COUNTY OF ______
97 I do solemnly swear (or affirm) that my name is
98 ______; that my date of birth is ______; that the
99 last four digits of my Social Security Number are

101 County or City (if a City not within a County),
102 Missouri; that I am a qualified voter of said
103 County (or City not within a County); that I am
104 eligible to vote at this polling place; and that I
105 have not voted in this election.
106 I understand that if the above-provided information
107 is not correct and the election authority
108 determines that I am not registered and eligible to
109 vote, my vote will not be counted. I further
SB 917 22
110 understand that knowingly providing false
111 information is a violation of law and subjects me
112 to possible criminal prosecution.

121 The voter may provide additional information to further
122 assist the election authority in determining eligibility,
123 including the place and date the voter registered to vote,
124 if known.
125 5. (1) Prior to counting any provisional ballot, the
126 election authority shall determine if the voter is
127 registered and eligible to vote and if the vote was properly
128 cast. The eligibility of provisional votes shall be
129 determined according to the requirements for a voter to cast
130 a ballot in the election as set forth in sections 115.133
131 and 115.135. A provisional voter ballot shall not be
132 eligible to be counted until the election authority has
133 determined that:
134 (a) The voter cast such provisional ballot at a
135 polling place established for the voter or the central
136 polling place established by the election authority under
137 subsection 5 of section 115.115;

142 election by regular ballot, absentee ballot, or otherwise;
143 and
144 (d) The information on the provisional ballot envelope
145 is found to be correct, complete, and accurate.
146 (2) When the ballot boxes are delivered to the
147 election authority from the polling places, the receiving
148 teams shall separate the provisional ballots from the rest
149 of the ballots and place the sealed provisional ballot
150 envelopes in a separate container. Teams of election
151 authority employees or teams of election judges with each
152 team consisting of one member of each major political party
153 shall photocopy each provisional ballot envelope, such
154 photocopy to be used by the election authority to determine
155 provisional voter eligibility. The sealed provisional
156 ballot envelopes shall be placed by the team in a sealed
157 container and shall remain therein until tabulation.
158 (3) To determine whether a provisional ballot is valid
159 and entitled to be counted, the election authority shall
160 examine its records and verify that the provisional voter is
161 properly registered and eligible to vote in the election.
162 If the provisional voter has provided information regarding
163 the registration agency where the provisional voter
164 registered to vote, the election authority shall make an
165 inquiry of the registration agency to determine whether the
166 provisional voter is properly registered and eligible to
167 vote in the election.
168 (4) If the election authority determines that the
169 provisional voter is registered and eligible to vote in the
SB 917 24
170 election, the election authority shall provide documentation
171 verifying the voter's eligibility. Such documentation shall
172 be noted on the copy of the provisional ballot envelope and
173 shall contain substantially the following information:
174 (a) The name of the provisional voter;
175 (b) The name of the reviewer;
176 (c) The date and time; and
177 (d) A description of evidence found that supports the
178 voter's eligibility.
179 (5) The local election authority shall record on a
180 provisional ballot acceptance/rejection list the provisional
181 ballot identification number and a notation marking it as
182 accepted.
183 (6) If the election authority determines that the
184 provisional voter is not registered or eligible to vote in
185 the election, the election authority shall provide
186 documentation verifying the voter's ineligibility. Such
187 documentation shall be noted on the copy of the provisional
188 ballot envelope and shall contain substantially the
189 following information:
190 (a) The name of the provisional voter;
191 (b) The name of the reviewer;
192 (c) The date and time;
193 (d) A description of why the voter is ineligible.
194 (7) The local election authority shall record on a
195 provisional ballot acceptance/rejection list the provisional
196 ballot identification number and notation marking it as
197 rejected.
198 (8) If rejected, a photocopy of the envelope shall be
199 made and used by the election authority as a mail-in voter
200 registration. The actual provisional ballot envelope shall
201 be kept as ballot material, and the copy of the envelope
SB 917 25
202 shall be used by the election authority for registration
203 record keeping.
204 6. All provisional ballots cast by voters whose
205 eligibility has been verified as provided in this section
206 shall be counted in accordance with the rules governing
207 ballot tabulation. Provisional ballots shall not be counted
208 until all provisional ballots are determined either eligible
209 or ineligible and all provisional ballots must be processed
210 before the election is certified. The provisional ballot
211 shall be counted only if the election authority determines
212 that the voter is registered and eligible to vote.
213 Provisional ballots voted in the wrong polling place shall
214 not be counted. If the voter is not registered but is
215 qualified to register for future elections, the affidavit
216 shall be considered a mail-in application to register to
217 vote pursuant to this chapter.
218 7. (1) After the election authority completes its
219 review of the provisional voter's eligibility under
220 subsection 5 of this section, the election authority shall
221 deliver the provisional ballots and copies of the
222 provisional ballot envelopes that include eligibility
223 information to bipartisan counting teams, which may be the
224 board of verification, for review and tabulation. The
225 election authority shall maintain a record of such
226 delivery. The record shall include the number of ballots
227 delivered to each team and shall include a signed receipt
228 from two judges, one from each major political party. The
229 election authority shall provide each team with a ballot box
230 and material necessary for tabulation.
231 (2) If the person named on the provisional ballot
232 affidavit is found to have been properly qualified and
233 registered to cast a ballot in the election and the
SB 917 26
234 provisional ballot otherwise qualifies to be counted under
235 the provisions of this section, the envelope shall be
236 opened, and the ballot shall be placed in a ballot box to be
237 counted.
238 (3) If the person named on the provisional ballot
239 affidavit is found not to have been properly qualified and
240 registered to cast a ballot in the election or if the
241 election authority is unable to determine such person's
242 right to vote, the envelope containing the provisional
243 ballot shall not be opened, and the person's vote shall not
244 be counted. The members of the team shall follow the
245 procedures set forth in subsection 5 of this section for
246 rejected provisional ballots.
247 (4) The votes shall be tallied and the returns made as
248 provided in sections 115.447 to 115.525 [for paper ballots].
249 After the vote on all ballots assigned to a team have been

251 envelopes with the eligibility information provided by the
252 election authority shall be enclosed in sealed containers
253 marked "Voted provisional ballots and ballot envelopes from
254 the election held ______, 20______". All rejected
255 provisional ballots, ballot envelopes, and copies of ballot
256 envelopes with the eligibility information provided by the
257 election authority shall be enclosed in sealed containers
258 marked "Rejected provisional ballots and ballot envelopes
259 from the election held ______, 20______". On the outside of
260 each voted ballot and rejected ballot container, each member

269 copies of the provisional ballot envelopes that include
270 eligibility information provided by the election authority.
271 Challengers and watchers shall be permitted to observe the
272 determination of the eligibility of all provisional

293 [12.] 10. The secretary of state shall design and
294 provide to the election authorities the envelopes and forms
295 necessary to carry out the provisions of this section.
SB 917 28
296 [13.] 11. Pursuant to the Help America Vote Act of
297 2002, the secretary of state shall ensure a free access
298 system is established, such as a toll-free number or an
299 internet website, that any individual who casts a
300 provisional ballot may access to discover whether the vote
301 of that individual was counted, and, if the vote was not
302 counted, the reason that the vote was not counted. At the
303 time an individual casts a provisional ballot, the election
304 authority shall give the voter written information that
305 states that any individual who casts a provisional ballot
306 will be able to ascertain under such free access system
307 whether the vote was counted, and if the vote was not
308 counted, the reason that the vote was not counted.
309 [14.] 12. In accordance with the Help America Vote Act
310 of 2002, any individual who votes in an election as a result
311 of a court order or any other order extending the time
312 established for closing the polls in section 115.407 may
313 vote only by using a provisional ballot, and such
314 provisional ballot shall be separated and held apart from
315 other provisional ballots cast by those not affected by the
316 order. Such ballots shall not be counted until such time as
317 the ballots are determined to be valid. No state court
318 shall have jurisdiction to extend the polling hours
319 established by law, including section 115.407.

2 has been initialed, two judges of different political
3 parties, or one judge from a major political party and one
4 judge with no political affiliation, shall[, where paper
5 ballots are used,] initial the voter's ballot [or ballot
6 card].
1 115.436. 1. [In jurisdictions using paper ballots and
2 electronic voting systems,] When any physically disabled
SB 917 29
3 voter within two hundred feet of a polling place is unable
4 to enter the polling place, two election judges, one of each
5 major political party, shall take a ballot[, equipment] and
6 materials necessary for voting to the voter. The voter
7 shall mark the ballot, and the election judges shall place
8 the ballot in an envelope and place it in the ballot box.
9 2. [In jurisdictions using voting machines, when any
10 physically disabled voter within two hundred feet of a
11 polling place is unable to enter the polling place, two
12 election judges, one of each major political party, shall
13 take an absentee ballot to the voter. The voter shall mark
14 the ballot, and the election judges shall place the ballot
15 in an envelope and place it in the ballot box.
16 3.] Upon request to the election authority, the
17 election authority in any jurisdiction shall designate a

19 other than the polling place to which that voter would
20 normally be assigned to vote, provided that the candidates
21 and issues voted on are consistent for both the designated
22 location and the voting location for the voter's precinct.
23 Upon request, the election authority may also assign members
24 of the physically disabled voter's household and such
25 voter's caregiver to the same voting location as the
26 physically disabled voter. In no event shall a voter be
27 assigned under this section to a designated location apart
28 from the established voting location for the voter's
29 precinct if the voter objects to the assignment to another
30 location.
1 115.439. 1. [If paper ballots are used,] The voter

23 BALLOTS". After another ballot has been prepared in the
24 manner provided in section 115.433, the ballot shall be
25 given to the voter for voting.
26 3. Any rule or portion of a rule, as that term is
27 defined in section 536.010, that is created under the
28 authority delegated in this section shall become effective
29 only if it complies with and is subject to all of the
30 provisions of chapter 536 and, if applicable, section
31 536.028. This section and chapter 536 are nonseverable and
32 if any of the powers vested with the general assembly
33 pursuant to chapter 536 to review, to delay the effective
34 date or to disapprove and annul a rule are subsequently held
35 unconstitutional, then the grant of rulemaking authority and

12 2. The election judges shall remove the
13 ballot cards from the ballot box and separate

15 without write-in votes. If there is a separate
16 form for write-in votes, all forms on which
17 write-in votes have been recorded shall be
18 consecutively numbered, starting with the number
19 one, and the same number shall be placed on the

21 write-in votes is to be done at the polling
22 place, the election judges shall compare the
23 write-in votes with the votes cast on the ballot
24 card. If the total number of votes including
25 write-in votes for any office exceeds the number
26 allowed by law, or if a voter has voted more
27 than once for the same person for the same
28 office at the same election, a notation of the

36 shall be counted for any candidate for any
37 office whose name appears on the ballot label as
38 a candidate for the office, except when more
39 than one person is to be nominated or elected to
40 an office. When more than one person is to be
41 nominated or elected to an office, the voter may
42 write in the names of one or more persons whose
43 names do not appear on the ballot label with or
44 without the names of one or more persons whose
45 names do appear.
SB 917 55
46 4. If any ballot card is damaged so that
47 it cannot properly be counted by the automatic
48 tabulating equipment, the fact shall be noted on
49 the back of the ballot card and it shall be
50 returned to the counting location in the
51 envelope marked "DEFECTIVE BALLOTS".]
1 [115.469. 1. If authorized by the
2 election authority, the election judges at any
3 polling place using an electronic voting system
4 may read and record write-in votes before the
5 close of the polls and may send other voted
6 ballots to the counting place. If so
7 authorized, the election judges shall use one
8 ballot box for the deposit of ballots during the
9 first five hours of voting. Between eleven
10 o'clock in the morning and twelve noon, the
11 receiving judges shall deliver the ballot box to
12 the counting and recording judges, who shall
13 give the receiving judges a second empty ballot
14 box. The second ballot box shall be shown to be
15 empty and locked in the manner provided in
16 section 115.423. The second ballot box shall
17 not be opened or removed from public view from
18 the time it is shown to be empty until the time
19 the polls close. The ballot box containing the
20 voted ballots shall be taken to a private area
21 within the polling place, and the write-in votes
22 shall be read and recorded in the manner
23 provided in section 115.467.
24 2. If early counting of write-in votes is
25 begun pursuant to this section, the election
26 judges shall, after counting and recording all
27 proper write-in votes, separate all ballot
28 cards, except defective ballot cards, from the
29 write-in forms if any. The ballots which do not
30 have write-in votes shall then be sent to the
31 counting place in the same manner as ballots are
32 sent upon the close of the polls. The election
33 judges shall enclose the ballot cards, the
34 envelope marked "DEFECTIVE BALLOTS", and all
35 write-in forms containing proper votes, in a
36 container designated by the election authority.
37 The container shall be securely sealed in such a
38 manner that if the container is opened, the seal
39 will be broken beyond repair. On the outside of
40 the container, the location of the polling place
41 and the date of the election shall be printed.
42 After sealing, the container shall be closely
43 watched by the election judges until it is
44 delivered to the counting location.

48 election judges who shall, between the hours of
49 eleven o'clock in the morning and three o'clock
50 in the afternoon, receive the ballot container
SB 917 56
51 from the election judges at the polling place
52 and immediately deliver it to the counting
53 location. Each team appointed pursuant to this
54 subsection shall consist of two members, one
55 from each major political party. If any ballot
56 container is not sealed when it is delivered to
57 the counting location, the election official
58 receiving the container shall make a statement
59 of the fact which includes the location of the
60 polling place and the date of the election
61 printed on the container and the reason the
62 container is not sealed, if known.

64 location, any ballot which is damaged and cannot
65 be properly counted by the automatic tabulating
66 equipment may be handcounted or duplicated in
67 the manner provided in subsection 3 of section
68 115.477.
69 5. After delivery to the counting
70 location, the proper votes on each ballot card
71 may be transferred to magnetic tapes. Under no
72 circumstances shall any such tape be read or
73 interpreted until after the time fixed by law
74 for the close of the polls and then only in the
75 manner provided in section 115.477.
76 6. Write-in ballots may also be counted as

6 count shall not be adjourned or postponed until
7 all proper votes have been counted.
8 2. The election judges shall open the
9 counting compartment on each voting machine or,
10 if a machine is equipped with a device for
11 printing, embossing or photographing the
12 registering counters, the judges shall operate
13 the machine to produce a record of the
14 counters. One counting judge shall read the
15 total vote cast for each candidate and for and
16 against each question on each machine. The
17 other counting judge shall watch and verify each
18 total as it is being read from the recording
19 counters or from the record of the counters.
20 The two recording judges shall each record the
21 votes cast for each candidate and for and
22 against each question as they are called out and
23 verified by the counting judges.
24 3. All proper write-in votes shall be
25 read, recorded and counted as provided in
26 sections 115.449 and 115.453. No write-in vote
27 shall be counted for any candidate for any
28 office whose name appears on the ballot label as
29 a candidate for the office, except when more
30 than one person is to be nominated or elected to
31 an office. When more than one person is to be
32 nominated or elected to an office, the voter may
33 write in the names of one or more persons whose
34 names do not appear on the ballot label with or
35 without the names of one or more persons whose
36 names do appear. No write-in vote shall be
37 counted unless it is cast in the appropriate
38 place on the machine.
39 4. If more than one voting machine is used
40 in a polling place, the election judges shall
41 read, verify and record all the totals from the
SB 917 61
42 first machine before proceeding to the second,
43 and so on, until all of the totals on each
44 machine in the polling place have been read,
45 verified and recorded. The total number of
46 votes from each machine shall be added to the
47 write-in votes to determine the total vote for
48 each candidate and for and against each
49 question.]
1 [115.495. 1. After being secured against
2 further voting by the election judges,
3 electronic voting machines shall remain secured
4 for the period provided by law for filing an
5 election contest and as much longer as may be
6 necessary or advisable because of any threatened
7 or pending contest, grand jury investigation, or
8 civil or criminal case relating to the
9 election. During this time, the electronic
10 voting machines shall not be unsecured, except
11 upon order of a court, grand jury or legislative
12 body trying an election contest.
13 2. Notwithstanding the provisions of
14 subsection 1 of this section to the contrary,
15 when an election is required by law to be held
16 after an election during any period of time
17 described in subsection 1 of this section, the
18 data of the electronic voting machine relating
19 to the initial election shall be removed and
20 secured and such machine shall be made available
21 for use in the subsequent election.]
1 [115.503. 1. As soon as possible after an
2 election in which electronic voting machines are
3 used, the verification board, or a bipartisan
4 committee appointed by the verification board,
5 shall inspect each secured electronic voting
6 machine and record the votes cast on the
7 machine. In precincts where electronic voting
8 machines equipped with printed election returns
9 mechanisms are used, the counter compartment
10 shall not be opened and the original and
11 duplicate originals of the printed return sheets
12 of the votes cast on questions and for
13 candidates regularly nominated, or who have duly
14 filed, together with the tabulation and
15 inclusion of any votes written in on the paper
16 roll for those not regularly nominated, or who
17 have not filed, shall constitute the official
18 return sheet for the votes cast on that machine,
19 when properly certified by the precinct election
20 officers. One copy of such printed return sheet
21 shall be returned to the election authority and
22 retained by it for not less than one year. Any
23 bipartisan committee appointed pursuant to this
24 subsection shall consist of at least two people,
25 one from each major political party, who shall
26 be appointed in the same manner and possess the
27 same qualifications as election judges.
SB 917 62
28 2. After the verification board or
29 committee has completed its inspection and
30 record, it shall compare the record with the
31 returns made by the election judges on election
32 day. If there is a discrepancy between the
33 returns of the election judges and the record of
34 the verification board or committee, the
35 verification board shall correct the returns
36 made by the judges to conform to its record.
37 The corrected returns shall supersede the
38 returns made by the election judges on election
39 day. Both the record and the returns shall be
40 retained by the election authority as provided
41 in section 115.493.]
1 Section B. Section A of this act shall become
2 effective on January 1, 2025.
