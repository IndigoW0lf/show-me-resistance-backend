39 subsequently investigate or conduct a family assessment as a result of that report. Such an
40 exception shall not limit the administrative or judicial authority of the state to ensure that
41 medical services are provided to the child when the child's health requires it.

62 to this section has reason to believe that the victim of such abuse or neglect is a resident of
