6 (1) The name of the municipality imposing the tax;

8 (3) The citation to the municipal code provisions imposing the tax; and

12 the municipality in question at the time of August 28, 2005, had an ordinance which imposed
13 a flat fee instead of a fee based on gross receipts as its business license tax. In compiling the
14 list, the director shall collect information from telecommunications companies,
15 municipalities, municipal codes, and other reliable sources.
16 2. (1) On or before February 1, 2006, all telecommunications companies in Missouri
17 shall provide the director and the state auditor with the amount of municipal business license
18 tax which they paid each Missouri municipality identified by the director in accordance with
19 subsection 1 of this section for the previous four quarters. On or before February 1, 2006, all
20 telecommunications companies in Missouri shall provide the director and the state auditor
21 with an itemized list establishing their gross receipts for the previous four quarters for each
22 category of gross receipts in each municipality identified by the director in accordance with
23 subsection 1 of this section upon which a sales tax is paid.
24 (2) On or before February 1, 2006, each municipality shall provide the director and
25 state auditor with the total amount of tax revenue collected for the previous fiscal year of
26 taxable gross receipts from telecommunications companies. Any inconsistency or dispute
27 arising from the information provided by the municipalities and telecommunications
28 companies shall be resolved through an audit performed by the state auditor.
29 3.] 2. Beginning on July 1, [2006] 2025, the director shall henceforth collect,
30 administer, and distribute telecommunications business license tax revenues in accordance
31 with the provisions of sections 92.074 to [92.095] 92.092.
32 [4.] 3. Notwithstanding the provisions of any municipal business license tax
33 ordinance, effective July 1, [2006] 2025, all business license taxes shall [be based solely and
34 exclusively on] not exceed those gross receipts of telecommunications companies for the
35 retail sale of telecommunications services [which are subject to taxation under sections
36 144.010 and 144.020]. Any provisions in any municipal taxing ordinances [which provide
37 different] that adopt definitions, rules, or provisions that purport to impose any business
HB 2606 4
38 license tax on gross receipts in excess of telecommunications service including, but not
39 limited to, interstate or international telecommunications services as described in
40 paragraph (b) of subdivision (4) of subsection 1 of section 144.020, are expressly
41 preempted and are null and void.
42 [5.] 4. The director is authorized to promulgate regulations to establish the
43 appropriate procedures for collecting, administering, and distributing such taxes. A
44 telecommunications company shall file a quarterly return with the director with an attached
45 schedulesettingforththetotalamountoftaxablegrossreceiptsforthequarterandtheamount
46 of business license tax due to each municipality. The director shall distribute the appropriate
47 amounts, as set forth in this section, to the municipalities. In exchange for its collection,
48 administration, and distribution functions, the department of revenue shall retain a collection
49 fee of up to one percent [(], not to exceed the actual costs incurred[)], on all funds collected
50 and distributed and shall be allowed to collect the interest off such funds during the time
51 between collection and distribution. In no event shall the director fail to distribute the
52 collected funds to a municipality more than thirty days after the collection of the funds.
53 [6. It is the intent of the general assembly that sections 92.074 to 92.095 comply with
54 Article X, Section 22 of the Missouri Constitution, so that the application of sections 92.074
55 to 92.095 shall have a revenue-neutral effect. Because business license taxes shall now be
56 basedonthegrossreceiptssubjecttothesalestax,itisanticipatedthatthebaseoftheexisting
57 business license taxes in most cases shall be broadened, so in order to comply with Article X,
58 Section 22 of the Missouri Constitution, the municipality shall adjust the gross receipts
59 percentage rate identified by the director in accordance with subsection 2 of this section so
60 that the amount collectible, in total from all telecommunications companies, excluding the
61 collection fee authorized in subsection 5 as defined herein, before and immediately after
62 enactment remains the same in each municipality. If the determination is made by a
63 municipality that in order to comply with Article X, Section 22 of the Missouri Constitution
64 the gross receipts percentage rate must be increased, such increase shall be passed by a
65 majority vote of the qualified voters voting in that municipality. The existing tax base shall
66 be an amount equal to the total amount of telecommunications business license taxes
67 collected by a municipality for fiscal year 2005, increased by fifty percent of the difference
68 between such amount and the business license tax receipts that would have been yielded by
69 applying the gross receipts percentage rate identified in accordance with subsection 1 of this
70 section to the total gross receipts for all wireless telecommunications services provided by
71 telecommunications companies as identified in 47 U.S.C. Section 332(D)(1) and 47 C.F.R.
72 Parts 22 or 24 in such fiscal year attributable to the municipality. Based upon the rate
73 information received from the director under this section, each municipality shall, no later
74 than April 1, 2006, promulgate and publish the revenue-neutral rates to be applied in each
HB 2606 5
75 municipality. Suchtaxratesshallbetheapplicablebusinesslicensetaxratefor billsrendered
76 on or after July 1, 2006. Any percentages in any ordinance that are contrary to that
77 establishedbythemunicipalityhereinarenullandvoid. Ifanymunicipalbusinesslicensetax
78 ordinance as of January 1, 2005, had a provision stating that the tax only applied to business
79 customers, the new calculated rate under this section also shall be determined based only on
80 business customers and shall apply only to business customers.
81 7. On or before April 1, 2007, the director, in consultation with the state auditor and
82 municipalities, shall examine revenues collected and forecast whether a shortfall or excess in
83 municipal revenues for each municipality is likely to occur for the fiscal year ending June 30,
84 2007, due to data reporting errors or other errors in the calculation of the revenue-neutral tax
85 rate. Section 32.057 shall not restrict the disclosure of information to perform such
86 consultation. If a shortfall or excess is expected,the director, after review and comment from
87 municipalities and telecommunications companies, shall promulgate and publish an
88 adjustment in the rate in such municipalities. Such tax rate adjustment, if necessary, shall
89 apply to bills issued after July 1, 2007.
90 8.] 5. The director shall be notified in writing within thirty days of any change in the
91 municipal business license tax rate adopted by a municipality. The director shall promulgate
92 suchratechanges,butsuchratechanges[mayonly]shalltakeeffectonlyonthefirstdayofa
93 calendar quarter and only after a minimum of ninety days notice from the director to a
94 telecommunications company. Any subsequent increase in the business license tax rate
95 passed through an ordinance by a municipality [which] that is above that rate as [established
96 by the municipality under] identified in accordance with subsection [6] 1 of this section
97 shall be passed by a majority vote of the qualified voters voting in that municipality. No
98 municipal tax rate shall exceed the cap provided in subsection [9] 6 of this section.
99 [9.] 6. Notwithstanding the provisions of subsections [3] 2 to [8] 5 of this section or
100 any other provision of law to the contrary, [for any municipality not subject to the provisions
101 of subsection 10 of this section,] the maximum rate of taxation on gross receipts shall not
102 exceed five percent for bills rendered on or after July 1, [2006, except if the business license
103 tax rate for any municipality, as calculated in subsection 6 of this section, or if necessary,
104 subsection 7 of this section, is determined to be greater than five percent, then,
105 notwithstanding the provisions of such subsections, the business license tax rates for such
106 municipality on and after July 1, 2006, shall be as follows:
107 (1) For bills rendered between July 1, 2006, and June 30, 2008, the rate shall be the
108 actual adjusted rate as determined by subsection 6 of this section, or, if necessary, subsection
109 7 of this section;
110 (2) For bills rendered between July 1, 2008, and June 30, 2010, the rate shall be half
111 the sum of the rate determined in subdivision (1) of this subsection and five percent; and
HB 2606 6
112 (3) For all bills rendered on and after July 1, 2010, five percent] 2025.
113 [10. (1) Any municipality which prior to November 4, 1980, had an ordinance
114 imposing a business license tax on telecommunications companies which specifically
115 included the words "wireless", "cell phones", or "mobile phones" in its business license tax
116 ordinance as revenues upon which a business license tax could be imposed, and had not
117 limited its tax to local exchange telephone service or landlines, and had taken affirmative
118 action to collect such tax from wireless telecommunications providers prior to January 15,
119 2005,shallnotberequiredtoadjustitsbusinesslicensetaxrateasprovidedinsubsection6of
120 this section and shall not be subject to the provisions of subsection 9 of this section.
121 (2) Any municipality which has an ordinance or an amendment to an ordinance
122 imposing a business license tax on telecommunications companies which was authorized or
123 amended by a public vote subsequent to November 4, 1980, and such authorization
124 specifically included the terms "wireless", "cell phones", or "mobile telephones" as revenues
125 upon which a business license tax could be imposed, and had not limited its tax to local
126 exchange telephone service or landlines, and had taken affirmative action to collect such tax
127 from wireless telecommunications providers prior to January 15, 2005, shall not be required
128 to adjust its business license tax rate as provided in subsection 6 of this section and shall not
129 be subject to the provisions of subsection 9 of this section.
130 11.] 7. For purposes of sections 92.074 to [92.095] 92.092, the director and any
131 municipality shall have the authority to audit any telecommunications company.
132 Notwithstanding the provisions of section 32.057, the director of revenue shall furnish any
133 municipality with information it requests to permit the municipality to review and audit the
134 payments of any telecommunications company.
135 [12.] 8. The statute of limitations shall be three years for the alleged nonpayment or
136 underpayment of the business license tax.
137 [13.] 9. Any telecommunications company is authorized to pass through to its retail
138 customers all or part of the business license tax.
139 [14.] 10. The provisions of [subsection 5 of section 144.190] section 144.013 and
140 subdivision (3) of subsection 12 of section 32.087 shall apply to the tax imposed under
141 sections 92.074 to [92.095] 92.092.
142 [15.] 11. Unless specifically stated otherwise in sections 92.074 to [92.095] 92.092,
143 taxpayer remedies, enforcement mechanisms, tax refunds, tax protests, assessments, and all
144 other procedures shall be the same as those provided in chapter 144.
145 [16.] 12. Any rule or portion of a rule, as that term is defined in section 536.010, that
146 is created under the authority delegated in this section shall become effective only if it
147 complies with and is subject to all of the provisions of chapter 536 and, if applicable, section
148 536.028. This section and chapter 536 are nonseverable and if any of the powers vested with
HB 2606 7
149 the general assembly pursuant to chapter 536 to review, to delay the effective date, or to
150 disapprove and annul a rule are subsequently held unconstitutional, then the grant of
151 rulemakingauthorityandany ruleproposed or adoptedafterAugust 28, [2005]2024,shall be
152 invalid and void.
92.089. 1. The general assembly finds and declares [it to be the policy of the state of
2 Missouri that costly litigation which have or may be filed by Missouri municipalities against
3 telecommunications companies, concerning the application of certain business license taxes
4 to certain telecommunications companies, and to certain revenues of those
5 telecommunications companies, as set forth below, is detrimental to the economic well
6 being of the state, and the claims of the municipal governments regarding such business
7 licenses have neither been determined to be valid nor liquidated. The general assembly
8 further finds and declares that the resolution of such uncertain litigation, the uniformity, and
9 the administrative convenience and cost savings to municipalities resulting from, and the
10 revenues which will or may accrue to municipalities in the future as a result of the enactment
11 of sections 92.074 to 92.095 are full and adequate consideration to municipalities, as the term
12 "consideration" is used in Article III, Section 39(5) of the Missouri Constitution, for the
13 immunity and dismissal of lawsuits outlined in subsection 2 of this section.
14 2. In the event any telecommunications company, prior to July 1, 2006, failed to pay
15 any amount to a municipality based on a subjective good faith belief that either:
16 (1) It was not a telephone company covered by the municipal business license tax
17 ordinance, or the statute authorizing the enactment of such taxing ordinance, or did not
18 provide telephone service as stated in the business license tax ordinance, and therefore owed
19 no business license tax to the municipality; or
20 (2) That certain categories of its revenues did not qualify under the definition or
21 wording of the ordinance as gross receipts or revenues upon which business license taxes
22 should be calculated;
23
24 such a telecommunications company is entitled to full immunity from, and shall not be liable
25 toamunicipalityfor,thepaymentofthedisputedamountsofbusinesslicensetaxes,uptoand
26 including July 1, 2006. However, such immunity and release from liability shall not apply to
27 anybusinesslicensetaximposedinaccordancewithsubdivisions(1)and(2)ofsubsection10
28 ofsection92.086orsections92.074to92.095afterJuly1,2006. Ifanymunicipality,priorto
29 July 1, 2006, has brought litigation or caused an audit of back taxes for the nonpayment by a
30 telecommunications company of municipal business license taxes, it shall immediately
31 dismiss such lawsuit without prejudice and shall cease and desist from continuing any audit,
32 except those cities described in subsection 10 of section 92.086] that sections 92.074 to
33 92.092 apply to an open-ended class of municipalities, consistent with requirements in
HB 2606 8
34 Article III, Section 40(30) of the Constitution of Missouri and cases interpreting such
35 provision, and that sections 92.074 to 92.092 cover all telephonic services, regardless of
36 thetype of technology used to provide the services, consistent with City of Jefferson City,
37 MO. v. Cingular Wireless, LLC, 531 F.3d 595 (8th Cir. 2008). Sections 92.074 to 92.092
38 reaffirm legislative intent that gross receipts from the provision of interstate
39 telecommunications service and international telecommunications service in this state
40 are not subject to the business license tax. Accordingly, City of Aurora v. Spectra
41 Communications Group, LLC, 592 S.W.3d 764 (Mo. banc 2019) and Collector of
42 Winchester v. Charter Communications, Inc., 660 S.W.3d 405 (Mo. Ct. App. E.D. 2022)
43 are abrogated to the extent inconsistent with sections 92.074 to 92.092.
44 2. The general assembly finds and declares that sections 92.074 to 92.092 do not
45 authorize the adoption of a new tax or the increase of an existing tax. No provision of
46 sections 92.074 to 92.092 shall be construed to:
47 (1) Authorize the expansion of any business license tax base by a municipality;
48 (2) Authorize the increase of any business license tax rate by a municipality; or
49 (3) Otherwise implicate Article X, Section 22 of the Constitution of Missouri.
92.092. All provisions of sections 92.074 to 92.089 are so essentially and inseparably
2 connected with, and so dependent upon, each other that no such provision would be enacted
3 without all others. If a court of competent jurisdiction enters a final judgment on the merits
4 that is not subject to appeal and that declares any provision or part of sections 92.074 to
5 92.089 unconstitutional or unenforceable [then], sections 92.074 to 92.089, in their collective
6 entirety, are invalid and shall have no legal effect as of the date of such judgment. In such
7 event, both telecommunications companies and municipalities shall have the same rights as
8 existedbeforeAugust28,[2005]2024,butshall notbeentitled toreimbursement,orrequired
9 to pay reimbursement, for any sums paid in the good faith belief in the validity and
10 constitutionality of sections 92.074 to 92.089.
[92.083. 1. On or after July 1, 2006, if any city, county, village, or
2 townhasimposed a business licensetax on a telecommunications company, as
3 authorized in this chapter, or chapter 66, 80, or 94, or under the authority
4 granted in its charter, the terms used in such ordinance shall be construed, for
5 the purposes of sections 92.074 to 92.095, to have the meanings set forth in
6 this section, regardless of any contrary definition in the ordinance:
7 (1) "Gross receipts" means all receipts from the retail sale of
8 telecommunications service taxable under section 144.020 and from any retail
9 customer now or hereafter exempt from the state sales tax;
10 (2) "Telephone service", "telecommunications service",
11 "telecommunications", "local exchange service", "local exchange telephone
12 transmission service", "exchange telephone service" or similar terms means
13 telecommunications service as defined in section 92.077.
HB 2606 9
14 2. Nothing in this section shall have the effect of repealing any
15 existing ordinance imposing a business license tax on a telecommunications
16 company; provided that a city with an ordinance in effect prior to August 28,
17 2005, complies with the provisions of section 92.086.
18 3. Any business license tax imposed on a telecommunications
19 company after July 1, 2006, shall be imposed on the retail sale of
20 telecommunications service.]
[92.095. The provisions of section 71.675 are severable from the
2 provisions of sections 92.074 to 92.092. If any portion of sections 92.074 to
3 92.092 is declared unconstitutional or the application of any part of sections
4 92.074 to 92.092 to any person or circumstance is held invalid, section 71.675
5 and its applicability to any person or circumstance shall remain valid and
6 enforceable. If any portion of section 71.675 is declared unconstitutional or
7 the application of any part of section 71.675 to any person or circumstance is
8 held invalid, sections 92.074 to 92.092 and its applicability to any person or
9 circumstance shall remain valid and enforceable.]
