To amend chapter 217, RSMo, by adding thereto one new section relating to a pilot project for
increasing children's access to incarcerated mothers.
Be it enacted by the General Assembly of the State of Missouri, as follows:
1 Section A. Chapter 217, RSMo, is amended by adding thereto
2 one new section, to be known as section 217.145, to read as
3 follows:
1 217.145. 1. Beginning January 1, 2025, the department
2 of corrections, with the cooperation of the children's
3 division within the department of social services, shall
4 establish a two-year pilot project to increase the access
5 children, ages newborn to seventeen, have to incarcerated
6 mothers who still have parental rights. Any person who has
7 pled guilty to or been found guilty of any of the offenses
8 listed under subsection 1 of section 210.117 if the victim
9 of the crime is a child or an offense of child abuse under
10 sections 210.109 to 210.183 shall not be eligible to
11 participate in the program.
12 2. The project shall include two prison facilities
13 that house women. One shall be located in Vandalia and one
14 shall be located in Chillicothe. The project shall focus
15 on, but not be limited to, children who live fifty or more
16 miles from the facility where their mothers are
17 incarcerated. The department of corrections and the
18 children's division within the department of social services
SB 1043 2
19 shall collaborate to develop and implement the project to
20 increase the access children have to incarcerated mothers
21 who still have parental rights by:
22 (1) Providing transportation for a child or children
23 and their caretaker for visits with the mother once a
24 month. The caretaker shall be required to attend the visit;
25 or
26 (2) Any other means available to increase visitation
27 between children and incarcerated mothers.
28 3. The department of corrections and the department of
29 social services may promulgate rules to implement the
30 provisions of this section. Any rule or portion of a rule,
31 as that term is defined in section 536.010, that is created
32 under the authority delegated in this section shall become
33 effective only if it complies with and is subject to all of
34 the provisions of chapter 536 and, if applicable, section
35 536.028. This section and chapter 536 are nonseverable and
36 if any of the powers vested with the general assembly
37 pursuant to chapter 536 to review, to delay the effective
38 date, or to disapprove and annul a rule are subsequently
39 held unconstitutional, then the grant of rulemaking
40 authority and any rule proposed or adopted after August 28,
41 2024, shall be invalid and void.
42 4. The pilot project shall be funded from existing
43 appropriations or with any moneys specifically appropriated
44 for this pilot project.
45 5. At the end of the two-year pilot project, the
46 director of the department of corrections and the director
47 of the children's division shall submit a joint report to
48 the governor and the general assembly by February 1, 2027,
49 on the efficacy of this pilot on both the children and the

SB 1043 3
51 The report shall include a recommendation as to whether the
52 project should be expanded to every prison facility and, if
53 so, any changes which should be made to the program.
