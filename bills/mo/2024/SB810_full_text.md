1 208.152. 1. MO HealthNet payments shall be made on
2 behalf of those eligible needy persons as described in
3 section 208.151 who are unable to provide for it in whole or
4 in part, with any payments to be made on the basis of the
5 reasonable cost of the care or reasonable charge for the
6 services as defined and determined by the MO HealthNet
7 division, unless otherwise hereinafter provided, for the
8 following:
9 (1) Inpatient hospital services, except to persons in
10 an institution for mental diseases who are under the age of
11 sixty-five years and over the age of twenty-one years;
12 provided that the MO HealthNet division shall provide
13 through rule and regulation an exception process for
14 coverage of inpatient costs in those cases requiring
15 treatment beyond the seventy-fifth percentile professional
16 activities study (PAS) or the MO HealthNet children's
17 diagnosis length-of-stay schedule; and provided further that
18 the MO HealthNet division shall take into account through
SB 810 2
19 its payment system for hospital services the situation of
20 hospitals which serve a disproportionate number of low-
21 income patients;
22 (2) All outpatient hospital services, payments
23 therefor to be in amounts which represent no more than
24 eighty percent of the lesser of reasonable costs or
25 customary charges for such services, determined in
26 accordance with the principles set forth in Title XVIII A
27 and B, Public Law 89-97, 1965 amendments to the federal
28 Social Security Act (42 U.S.C. Section 301, et seq.), but
29 the MO HealthNet division may evaluate outpatient hospital

34 (3) Laboratory and X-ray services;
35 (4) Nursing home services for participants, except to

40 health and senior services or a nursing home licensed by the

44 standards equivalent to licensing requirements in Title XIX
45 of the federal Social Security Act (42 U.S.C. Section 301,
46 et seq.), as amended, for nursing facilities. The MO
47 HealthNet division may recognize through its payment
48 methodology for nursing facilities those nursing facilities
49 which serve a high volume of MO HealthNet patients. The MO
50 HealthNet division when determining the amount of the
SB 810 3
51 benefit payments to be made on behalf of persons under the
52 age of twenty-one in a nursing facility may consider nursing
53 facilities furnishing care to persons under the age of
54 twenty-one as a classification separate from other nursing
55 facilities;
56 (5) Nursing home costs for participants receiving
57 benefit payments under subdivision (4) of this subsection

74 year for services limited to examinations, diagnoses,
75 adjustments, and manipulations and treatments of

79 shall be interpreted to otherwise expand MO HealthNet
80 services;
81 (8) Drugs and medicines when prescribed by a licensed
82 physician, dentist, podiatrist, or an advanced practice
SB 810 4
83 registered nurse; except that no payment for drugs and

86 practice registered nurse may be made on behalf of any
87 person who qualifies for prescription drug coverage under
88 the provisions of P.L. 108-173;

99 promulgated thereunder;
100 (11) Home health care services;

102 regulations; provided, however, that such family planning
103 services shall not include abortions or any abortifacient
104 drug or device that is used for the purpose of inducing an
105 abortion unless such abortions are certified in writing by a
106 physician to the MO HealthNet agency that, in the
107 physician's professional judgment, the life of the mother
108 would be endangered if the fetus were carried to term;
109 (13) Inpatient psychiatric hospital services for

118 persons who are eligible for coverage under Part B of Title
119 XVIII, Public Law 89-97, 1965 amendments to the federal
120 Social Security Act, as amended, if exclusion of such

124 oriented tasks having to do with a person's physical

126 enable a person to be treated by his or her physician on an
127 outpatient rather than on an inpatient or residential basis
128 in a hospital, intermediate care facility, or skilled
129 nursing facility. Personal care services shall be rendered
130 by an individual not a member of the participant's family
131 who is qualified to provide such services where the services
132 are prescribed by a physician in accordance with a plan of
133 treatment and are supervised by a licensed nurse. Persons
134 eligible to receive personal care services shall be those
135 persons who would otherwise require placement in a hospital,
136 intermediate care facility, or skilled nursing facility.
137 Benefits payable for personal care services shall not exceed
138 for any one participant one hundred percent of the average
139 statewide charge for care and treatment in an intermediate
140 care facility for a comparable period of time. Such
141 services, when delivered in a residential care facility or
142 assisted living facility licensed under chapter 198 shall be
143 authorized on a tier level based on the services the
144 resident requires and the frequency of the services. A
145 resident of such facility who qualifies for assistance under
146 section 208.030 shall, at a minimum, if prescribed by a
SB 810 6
147 physician, qualify for the tier level with the fewest
148 services. The rate paid to providers for each tier of
149 service shall be set subject to appropriations. Subject to
150 appropriations, each resident of such facility who qualifies
151 for assistance under section 208.030 and meets the level of
152 care required in this section shall, at a minimum, if
153 prescribed by a physician, be authorized up to one hour of
154 personal care services per day. Authorized units of
155 personal care services shall not be reduced or tier level
156 lowered unless an order approving such reduction or lowering
157 is obtained from the resident's personal physician. Such
158 authorized units of personal care services or tier level
159 shall be transferred with such resident if he or she
160 transfers to another such facility. Such provision shall
161 terminate upon receipt of relevant waivers from the federal
162 Department of Health and Human Services. If the Centers for
163 Medicare and Medicaid Services determines that such
164 provision does not comply with the state plan, this
165 provision shall be null and void. The MO HealthNet division
166 shall notify the revisor of statutes as to whether the
167 relevant waivers are approved or a determination of
168 noncompliance is made;
169 (16) Mental health services. The state plan for
170 providing medical assistance under Title XIX of the Social
171 Security Act, 42 U.S.C. Section 301, as amended, shall
172 include the following mental health services when such
173 services are provided by community mental health facilities
174 operated by the department of mental health or designated by
175 the department of mental health as a community mental health
176 facility or as an alcohol and drug abuse facility or as a
177 child-serving agency within the comprehensive children's
178 mental health service system established in section

179 630.097. The department of mental health shall establish by
180 administrative rule the definition and criteria for

182 designation as an alcohol and drug abuse facility. Such
183 mental health services shall include:

374 interdisciplinary assessment designed to restore an
375 individual to optimal level of physical, cognitive, and
376 behavioral function. The MO HealthNet division shall
377 establish by administrative rule the definition and criteria
378 for designation of a comprehensive day rehabilitation
379 service facility, benefit limitations and payment
380 mechanism. Any rule or portion of a rule, as that term is

382 authority delegated in this subdivision shall become
383 effective only if it complies with and is subject to all of
384 the provisions of chapter 536 and, if applicable, section
385 536.028. This section and chapter 536 are nonseverable and
386 if any of the powers vested with the general assembly
387 pursuant to chapter 536 to review, to delay the effective
388 date, or to disapprove and annul a rule are subsequently
389 held unconstitutional, then the grant of rulemaking
390 authority and any rule proposed or adopted after August 28,
391 2005, shall be invalid and void.
392 3. The MO HealthNet division may require any
393 participant receiving MO HealthNet benefits to pay part of
394 the charge or cost until July 1, 2008, and an additional
395 payment after July 1, 2008, as defined by rule duly
396 promulgated by the MO HealthNet division, for all covered
397 services except for those services covered under
398 subdivisions (15) and (16) of subsection 1 of this section
399 and sections 208.631 to 208.657 to the extent and in the
400 manner authorized by Title XIX of the federal Social
401 Security Act (42 U.S.C. Section 1396, et seq.) and
SB 810 14
402 regulations thereunder. When substitution of a generic drug
403 is permitted by the prescriber according to section 338.056,
404 and a generic drug is substituted for a name-brand drug, the
405 MO HealthNet division may not lower or delete the
406 requirement to make a co-payment pursuant to regulations of
407 Title XIX of the federal Social Security Act. A provider of
408 goods or services described under this section must collect
409 from all participants the additional payment that may be
410 required by the MO HealthNet division under authority
411 granted herein, if the division exercises that authority, to
412 remain eligible as a provider. Any payments made by
413 participants under this section shall be in addition to and
414 not in lieu of payments made by the state for goods or
415 services described herein except the participant portion of
416 the pharmacy professional dispensing fee shall be in
417 addition to and not in lieu of payments to pharmacists. A
418 provider may collect the co-payment at the time a service is
419 provided or at a later date. A provider shall not refuse to
420 provide a service if a participant is unable to pay a
421 required payment. If it is the routine business practice of
422 a provider to terminate future services to an individual
423 with an unclaimed debt, the provider may include uncollected
424 co-payments under this practice. Providers who elect not to
425 undertake the provision of services based on a history of
426 bad debt shall give participants advance notice and a
427 reasonable opportunity for payment. A provider,
428 representative, employee, independent contractor, or agent
429 of a pharmaceutical manufacturer shall not make co-payment
430 for a participant. This subsection shall not apply to other
431 qualified children, pregnant women, or blind persons. If
432 the Centers for Medicare and Medicaid Services does not
433 approve the MO HealthNet state plan amendment submitted by
SB 810 15
434 the department of social services that would allow a
435 provider to deny future services to an individual with
436 uncollected co-payments, the denial of services shall not be
437 allowed. The department of social services shall inform
438 providers regarding the acceptability of denying services as
439 the result of unpaid co-payments.
440 4. The MO HealthNet division shall have the right to
441 collect medication samples from participants in order to
442 maintain program integrity.
443 5. Reimbursement for obstetrical and pediatric
444 services under subdivision (6) of subsection 1 of this
445 section shall be timely and sufficient to enlist enough
446 health care providers so that care and services are
447 available under the state plan for MO HealthNet benefits at
448 least to the extent that such care and services are
449 available to the general population in the geographic area,
450 as required under subparagraph (a)(30)(A) of 42 U.S.C.
451 Section 1396a and federal regulations promulgated thereunder.
452 6. Beginning July 1, 1990, reimbursement for services
453 rendered in federally funded health centers shall be in
454 accordance with the provisions of subsection 6402(c) and
455 Section 6404 of P.L. 101-239 (Omnibus Budget Reconciliation
456 Act of 1989) and federal regulations promulgated thereunder.
457 7. Beginning July 1, 1990, the department of social
458 services shall provide notification and referral of children
459 below age five, and pregnant, breast-feeding, or postpartum
460 women who are determined to be eligible for MO HealthNet
461 benefits under section 208.151 to the special supplemental
462 food programs for women, infants and children administered
463 by the department of health and senior services. Such
464 notification and referral shall conform to the requirements
SB 810 16
465 of Section 6406 of P.L. 101-239 and regulations promulgated
466 thereunder.
467 8. Providers of long-term care services shall be
468 reimbursed for their costs in accordance with the provisions
469 of Section 1902 (a)(13)(A) of the Social Security Act, 42
470 U.S.C. Section 1396a, as amended, and regulations
471 promulgated thereunder.
472 9. Reimbursement rates to long-term care providers
473 with respect to a total change in ownership, at arm's
474 length, for any facility previously licensed and certified
475 for participation in the MO HealthNet program shall not
476 increase payments in excess of the increase that would
477 result from the application of Section 1902 (a)(13)(C) of
478 the Social Security Act, 42 U.S.C. Section 1396a (a)(13)(C).
479 10. The MO HealthNet division may enroll qualified
480 residential care facilities and assisted living facilities,
