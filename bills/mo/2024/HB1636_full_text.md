22 surviving spouse for a property tax credit if a person of the age of sixty-five years or older
23 who would have otherwise met the requirements for a property tax credit dies before the last
24 day of the calendar year. The residency requirement shall also be deemed to have been
25 fulfilled for the purpose of determining the eligibility of a claimant who would have

37 have not dealt at arm's length, and that the gross rent is excessive, then he shall determine the
38 gross rent based upon a reasonable amount of rent. Gross rent shall be deemed to be paid
39 only if actually paid prior to the date a return is filed. The director of revenue may prescribe
40 regulations requiring a return of information by a landlord receiving rent, certifying for a
41 calendar year the amount of gross rent received from a tenant claiming a property tax credit
42 and shall, by regulation, provide a method for certification by the claimant of the amount of
43 gross rent paid for any calendar year for which a claim is made. The regulations authorized

76 year. Property taxes shall qualify for the credit only if actually paid prior to the date a return

78 payment. Ifahomesteadisownedonlypartiallybyclaimant,then"propertytaxesaccrued"is
79 that part of property taxes levied on the homestead which was actually paid by the claimant.
80 For purposes of this subdivision, property taxes are "levied" when the tax roll is delivered to
81 the director of revenue for collection. If a claimant owns a homestead part of the preceding
82 calendar year and rents it or a different homestead for part of the same year, "property taxes
83 accrued" means only taxes levied on the homestead both owned and occupied by the
84 claimant, multiplied by the percentage of twelve months that such property was owned and
85 occupied as the homestead of the claimant during the year. When a claimant owns and
86 occupies two or more different homesteads in the same calendar year, property taxes accrued
87 shall be the sum of taxes allocable to those several properties occupied by the claimant as a
88 homestead for the year. If a homestead is an integral part of a larger unit such as a farm, or
89 multipurposeormultidwellingbuilding,propertytaxesaccruedshallbethatpercentageofthe

3 property taxes actually paid or eleven hundred dollars in actual property tax paid, shall be
4 used in determining the property tax credit, for all calendar years ending on or before
5 December 31, 2024. For all calendar years beginning on or after January 1, 2025, this
6 total, up to one thousand fifty-five dollars in rent constituting property taxes actually

105 exemption credit in the tax year next following the calendar year in which the
106 application was submitted.

119 assessed value of such improvements. If the dollar amount of the assessed value of such
120 improvements totals more than five percent of the assessed value from the most recent

128 the senate, and the director of the office of budget and planning in the office of

130 8. If, in any given year, the general assembly makes an appropriation for the
131 funding of the homestead exemption credit that is signed by the governor, the director
132 shall determine the apportionment percentage to set the homestead exemption limit by
133 apportioning the appropriation among all eligible applicants on a percentage basis, so
134 thatthetotalamountofallcreditsappliedforinagivenyearisthedenominatorandthe
135 amount of an applicant's credit applied for in a given year is the numerator. If no
HB 1636 12
136 appropriation is made by the general assembly during any given year or no funds are
137 actually distributed pursuant to any appropriation therefor, no homestead preservation
138 credit shall apply in such year.
139 9. After determining the apportionment percentage, the director shall calculate
140 the credit to be associated with each verified eligible owner's homestead, if any. The
141 director shall send a list of those eligible owners who are to receive the homestead
142 exemptioncredit,includingtheamountofeachcredit,thecertifiedparcelnumberofthe
143 homestead, and the address of the homestead property, to the county collectors, or
144 county clerks in counties with a township form of government notwithstanding section
145 32.057, not later than August thirty-first. Pursuant to such calculation, the director
146 shall instruct the state treasurer to distribute the appropriation to the county collector's
147 fund of each county or the treasurer ex officio collector's fund in counties with a
148 township form of government, where recipients of the homestead exemption credit are
149 located, in such amounts as would exactly offset each homestead exemption credit being
150 issued. In no case shall a political subdivision receive, as a result of appropriations,
151 more moneys than it would have received absent the provisions of this section. At the
152 direction of the county collector or the treasurer ex officio collector in counties with a

155 collector, or the treasurer ex officio collector in counties with a township form of
156 government, not later than October first in any year a homestead exemption credit is
157 appropriated as a result of this section and shall be distributed as moneys in such funds
158 are commonly distributed from other property tax revenues by the county collector, or
159 the treasurer ex officio collector of the county in counties with a township form of
160 government, in such amounts as would exactly offset each homestead exemption credit
161 being issued.
162 10. In the event that an eligible owner dies or transfers ownership of the
163 property after the homestead exemption limit has been set in any given year, but on or
164 before December thirty-first of the year in which the credit would otherwise be applied,
165 the credit shall be void and any corresponding moneys shall lapse to the state to be
166 credited to the general revenue fund. In the event the county collector, or the treasurer
167 ex officio collector of the county in counties with a township form of government,
168 determinespriortoissuingthecreditthattheindividualisnotaneligibleownerbecause
169 the individual did not pay his or her property tax liability in full for the most recent
170 prior three years, the credit shall be void and any corresponding moneys shall lapse to
171 the state to be credited to the general revenue fund. In the event the credit has already

172 been issued or applied, the department shall have the authority to recapture the benefit
173 of the credit in such cases under this subsection.
174 11. Any rule promulgated by the department shall in no way adversely impact,
175 affect, interrupt, or interfere with the performance of the required statutory duties of
176 any county elected official, more particularly including the county collector when
177 performing such duties as deemed necessary for the distribution of any homestead
178 appropriation and the collection of all other real and personal property taxes.
179 12. The department may promulgate all necessary rules and regulations for the
180 administration of this section. Any rule or portion of a rule, as that term is defined in
181 section 536.010, that is created under the authority delegated in this section shall
182 become effective only if it complies with and is subject to all of the provisions of chapter
183 536 and, if applicable, section 536.028. This section and chapter 536 are nonseverable
184 and if any of the powers vested with the general assembly pursuant to chapter 536 to
185 review, to delay the effective date, or to disapprove and annul a rule are subsequently
186 held unconstitutional, then the grant of rulemaking authority and any rule proposed or
187 adopted after August 28, 2024, shall be invalid and void.
188 13. Under section 23.253 of the Missouri sunset act:
189 (1) The provisions of the new program authorized under this section shall
190 automatically sunset December thirty-first, six years after the effective date of this
191 section unless reauthorized by an act of the general assembly;

193 shall automatically sunset December thirty-first, twelve years after the effective date of

202 eliminate any responsibility of the department to verify the continued eligibility of
203 qualified individuals receiving tax credits and to enforce other requirements of law that
204 applied before the program was sunset.
