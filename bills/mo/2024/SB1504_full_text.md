66 before the clerk of the circuit court of the judicial

79 disposition of the funds and property committed to their
80 charge; to order, decree and compel payment by them to the
81 public school retirement system of their school district of
82 all sums of money, and of the value of all property which

97 district, or by any two members of the board of trustees.

99 days' notice in writing to the member complained of, and an
100 appeal shall lie from the judgment of the circuit court as

124 engaged by the board of trustees and all other expenses of

169 15. At least once in each five-year period the actuary
170 shall make an investigation into the actuarial experience of
171 the retirement system, and taking into account the results

173 trustees shall adopt for the retirement system such
174 actuarial assumptions as shall be deemed necessary.
SB 1504 11
175 16. On the basis of such actuarial assumptions as the
176 board of trustees shall adopt, the actuary shall make an
177 annual valuation of the assets and liabilities of the funds

6 percent of his or her compensation.
7 (2) Beginning January 1, 2018, the percentage in
8 subdivision (1) of this subsection shall increase one-half
9 of one percent annually until such time as the percentage
10 equals nine percent unless a lower member contribution rate
11 applies for any period in accordance with the provisions of
12 subdivision (4) of subsection 5 of this section.
13 (3) For any member hired for the first time on or
14 after January 1, 2018, the employing board shall cause to be
15 deducted from the compensation of each member at every
16 payroll period nine percent of such member's compensation
17 unless a lower member contribution rate applies for any

19 of subsection 5 of this section.
20 (4) The amounts so deducted shall be transferred to
21 the board of trustees and credited to the individual account
22 of each member from whose compensation the deduction was
23 made. In determining the amount earnable by a member in any
24 payroll period, the board of trustees may consider the rate
SB 1504 12
25 of earnable compensation payable to such member on the first
26 day of the payroll period as continuing throughout such
27 payroll period; it may omit deduction from compensation for
28 any period less than a full payroll period if the employee
29 was not a member on the first day of the payroll period; and
30 to facilitate the making of the deductions, it may modify
31 the deduction required of any member by such amount as shall
32 not exceed one-tenth of one percent of the compensation upon
33 the basis of which such deduction was made.
34 (5) The deductions provided for herein are declared to
35 be a part of the salary of the member and the making of such
36 deductions shall constitute payments by the member out of
37 his or her salary or earnings and such deductions shall be
38 made notwithstanding that the minimum compensation provided
39 by law for any member shall be reduced thereby. Every
40 member shall be deemed to consent to the deductions made and
41 provided for herein, and shall receipt for his or her full
42 salary or compensation, and the making of said deductions
43 and the payment of salary or compensation less said
44 deduction shall be a full and complete discharge and
45 acquittance of all claims and demands whatsoever for
46 services rendered during the period covered by the payment
47 except as to benefits provided by sections 169.410 to
48 169.540.
49 (6) The employing board may elect to pay member
50 contributions required by this section as an employer pick
51 up of employee contributions under Section 414(h)(2) of the
52 Internal Revenue Code of 1986, as amended, and such
53 contributions picked up by the employing board shall be
54 treated as contributions made by members for all purposes of
55 sections 169.410 to 169.540.
SB 1504 13
56 3. If a retired member receiving a pension pursuant to
57 sections 169.410 to 169.540 is restored to active service
58 and again becomes an active member of the retirement system,
59 there shall be credited to his or her individual account an
60 amount equal to the excess, if any, of his or her
61 accumulated contributions at retirement over the total
62 pension benefits paid to him or her.
63 4. Annually, the actuary for the retirement system
64 shall calculate each employer's contribution as an amount
65 equal to a certain percentage of the total compensation of
66 all members employed by that employer. The percentage shall
67 be fixed on the basis of the liabilities of the retirement
68 system as shown by the annual actuarial valuation. The
69 annual actuarial valuation shall be made on the basis of
70 such actuarial assumptions and the actuarial cost method
71 adopted by the board of trustees, provided that the
72 actuarial cost method adopted shall be in accordance with
73 generally accepted actuarial standards and that the unfunded
74 actuarial accrued liability, if any, shall be amortized by
75 level annual payments over a period not to exceed thirty
76 years. The provisions of this subsection shall expire on
77 December 31, 2017; thereafter subsection 5 of this section
78 shall apply.
79 5. For calendar year 2018, the rate of contribution
80 payable by each employer shall equal sixteen percent of the
81 total compensation of all members employed by that
82 employer. For each calendar year thereafter, the percentage
83 rate of contribution payable by each employer of the total
84 compensation of all members employed by that employer shall
85 decrease one-half of one percent annually until calendar
86 year [2032] 2025 when the rate of contribution payable by
87 each employer shall equal [nine] fourteen percent of the
SB 1504 14
88 total compensation of all members employed by that
89 employer. For [subsequent] calendar [years after 2032] year
90 2026 and each calendar year thereafter, the rate of
91 contribution payable by each employer shall [equal nine
92 percent of the total compensation of all members employed by
93 that employer] be determined as follows:
94 (1) Annually, the board of trustees shall instruct the
95 retirement system actuary to determine the total actuarially
96 required contribution as well as the total actuarially
97 required contribution rate for the applicable calendar year
98 based on a valuation as of the first day of the preceding
99 calendar year;
100 (2) If the retirement system's funded ratio as of the
101 first day of the preceding calendar year is below one
102 hundred percent, the employer contribution rate shall be the
103 greater of fourteen percent or the difference between the
104 total actuarially required contribution rate and the member
105 contribution rate or rates in effect under subsection 2 of
106 this section, subject to the limits on annual adjustments
107 stated in subdivision (6) of this subsection;
108 (3) If the retirement system's funded ratio as of the
109 first day of the preceding calendar year equals or exceeds
110 one hundred percent and the total actuarially required
111 contribution rate exceeds eighteen percent, the employer
112 contribution rate shall be the difference between the total
113 actuarially required contribution rate and the member
114 contribution rate or rates in effect under subsection 2 of
115 this section, subject to the limits on annual adjustments
116 stated in subdivision (6) of this subsection;
117 (4) If the retirement system's funded ratio as of the
118 first day of the preceding calendar year equals or exceeds
119 one hundred percent and the total actuarially required
SB 1504 15
120 contribution rate does not exceed eighteen percent, the
121 total actuarially required contribution rate shall be
122 allocated equally between the employer contribution rate and
123 the member contribution rate. If the total actuarially
124 required contribution rate falls below eighteen percent
125 after being above eighteen percent for the preceding twelve-
126 month period, the member contribution rate and the employer
127 contribution rate shall be adjusted to one-half of the total
128 actuarially required contribution rate for such period,
129 regardless of the magnitude of the decrease from the rate in
130 effect for the prior period, in order to equalize the
131 employer and member contribution rates. Otherwise,
132 adjustments in the contribution rates shall be limited by
133 the annual adjustment limits stated in subdivision (6) of
134 this subsection;
135 (5) If the retirement system's funded ratio as of the
136 first day of the preceding calendar year again falls below
137 one hundred percent, or if the total actuarially required
138 contribution rate rises above eighteen percent, the
139 provisions of subdivision (2) or (3) of this subsection
140 shall apply, as applicable, subject to the limits on annual
141 adjustments stated in subdivision (6) of this subsection; and
142 (6) Except as stated in subdivision (4) of this
143 subsection, in transitioning to the contribution rates
144 prescribed in this subsection for periods beginning on or
145 after January 1, 2026, the employer contribution rate and
146 the member contribution rate, respectively, shall not
147 increase by more than one percent or decrease by more than
148 one-half percent for any period from the corresponding rate
149 in effect immediately before such increase or decrease.
150 6. The expense and contingency reserve shall be a
151 reserve for investment contingencies and estimated expenses
SB 1504 16
152 of administration of the retirement system as determined
153 annually by the board of trustees.
154 7. Gifts, devises, bequests and legacies may be
155 accepted by the board of trustees to be held and invested as
156 a part of the assets of the retirement system and shall not
157 be separately accounted for except where specific direction
158 for the use of a gift is made by a donor.
