5 their intent to do so on their application for a license
6 obtained under section 451.040 and by complying with the
7 requirements of this section. The returned marriage license
8 shall be designated a covenant marriage license and shall be

12 there is a court-ordered requirement that divorcing or

19 marriage under section 451.055, the court shall require that
20 both parties attend at least forty hours of marital
21 counseling before a dissolution may be granted. Counseling

46 that his or her spouse has abandoned the matrimonial
47 domicile and is expected to remain absent for the required
SB 1234 10
48 period of at least two years. If his or her spouse has not
49 abandoned the matrimonial domicile for the required period
50 of two years at the time of the filing of the petition, the
51 action of a dissolution of marriage shall be stayed for the
52 period of time remaining to meet the grounds based on
53 abandonment; except that, the court may enter and enforce

61 years. If the parties have not been separated continuously
62 for the required period of at least two years at the time of
63 the filing of the petition, the action of dissolution of
64 marriage shall be stayed until the requirement of living
65 apart and separate continuously for at least two years is
66 met; except that, the court may enter and enforce temporary
67 orders for a legal separation during the time that the
68 action is pending; or
69 (7) The husband and wife have attended at least forty
70 hours of marital counseling sessions over the course of at
71 least two years.
72 5. Dissolution under this section shall be granted
73 after all other remedies under this section have failed.
