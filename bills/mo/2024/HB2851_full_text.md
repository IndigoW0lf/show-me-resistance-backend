Section A. Sections 452.335 and 452.370, RSMo, are repealed and two new sections
2 enacted in lieu thereof, to be known as sections 452.335 and 452.370, to read as follows:
452.335. 1. In a proceeding for nonretroactive invalidity, dissolution of marriage or
2 legal separation, or a proceeding for maintenance following dissolution of the marriage by a
3 court which lacked personal jurisdiction over the absent spouse, the court may grant a
4 maintenance order, which may be bridge, rehabilitative, or durational, to either spouse,

56 marriage seeking maintenance with legitimate, identifiable short-term needs. The
57 length of the maintenance shall not exceed two years. An award of bridge maintenance
58 shall terminate upon the death of either party or upon the remarriage of the party
59 receiving maintenance. An award of bridge maintenance shall not be modifiable in
60 amount or duration.
61 6. (1) Rehabilitative maintenance may be awarded to assist a party to a short-
62 term or moderate-term marriage seeking maintenance in establishing the capacity for
63 self-support through either:
64 (a) The redevelopment of previous skills or credentials; or
65 (b) The acquisition of education, training, or work experience necessary to
66 develop appropriate employment skills or credentials.
67 (2) The length of the rehabilitative maintenance shall not exceed four years.
68 (3) An award of rehabilitative maintenance may be modified or terminated

HB 2851 4
91 9. In establishing the term of durational maintenance, and for purposes of all
92 maintenance modifications decided on or after August 28, 2024, the court shall consider
93 all relevant factors including, but not limited to:
94 (1) The retirement, or the prospect and ability of the payor of maintenance to
95 retire, from full-time employment or reduce his or her employment status to part-time
96 or accept lower paying employment as part of a plan to retire;
97 (2) The age of the party paying maintenance;
98 (3) The duration and amount of maintenance already paid, and the efforts made
99 by the party seeking maintenance to become self-supporting;
100 (4) The likelihood that the lifestyle of both spouses may reasonably decline
101 following a dissolution of marriage or legal separation and as the parties approach
102 retirement age; and
103 (5) The provisions of subsection 2 of this section.
104 10. Notwithstanding the limits set forth in subsections 6 and 8 of this section, a
105 court may award durational maintenance or modify rehabilitative or durational
106 maintenance in excess of the limits set forth in this section if the court specifically finds,
107 afterconsiderationofallrelevantfactors,includingthosesetforthinsubsection2ofthis
108 section, that:
109 (1) Such limits will result in a substantial and continuing hardship for the party
110 seeking, or currently receiving maintenance;
111 (2) The party seeking maintenance meets the criteria in subdivisions (1) and (2)
112 of subsection 1 of this section;
113 (3) The party seeking maintenance will be unable to establish the capacity for
114 self-support within the maintenance limits set forth in subsection 6 or 8 of this section
115 for the applicable marital duration at issue; and
116 (4) Extending the maintenance further under this subsection is just and fair to
117 both parties.
118
119 If the court extends the duration of the maintenance under this subsection, the court
120 shall enter written findings of fact and conclusions of law setting forth the grounds for
121 exceeding the limits set forth in this section in the order establishing or modifying
122 rehabilitative or durational maintenance, specifically addressing subdivisions (1) to (4)
123 of this subsection, provided that absent findings made by the court in accordance with
124 this subsection, the maximum duration for any maintenance ordered under this
125 subsection, or in any proceeding where maintenance is considered, shall be the lesser of
126 a time period equal to fifty percent of the duration of the marriage at issue, calculated
127 from the date of the marriage through separation, or fifteen years. The court shall also
HB 2851 5
128 incorporate as part of any modifiable maintenance order entered under this chapter a
129 specific order that the party receiving maintenance has an affirmative duty to make
130 reasonable and continuing efforts to establish the capacity for self-support and to
131 become self-supporting, and the failure to do so may be relied upon by the court as
132 grounds for a modification or termination of maintenance in any future proceeding
133 unless the physical or mental condition of the party seeking maintenance or the
134 application of subsection 12 or 13 of this section makes the inclusion of such a provision
135 in the order unreasonable or inappropriate.
136 11. Except as otherwise provided by subsection 12 or 13 of this section, an order
137 awardingmaintenanceshallbesubjecttomodification,ifmodifiable,orterminationifit
138 can be shown that the recipient and another person are cohabitating or have entered
139 intoamutuallysupportiverelationshipthatisthefunctionalequivalentofmarriageora
140 committed partnership that has existed for at least twelve months of an eighteen-month
141 period.
142 12. For purposes of modification of prior orders establishing maintenance, the
143 standards set forth in this section shall be applicable to all initial actions and
144 modifications decided on or after August 28, 2024. Notwithstanding provisions to the
145 contrary contained in this section or section 452.370, either party to any maintenance
146 order entered prior to August 28, 2024, may file a modification under section 452.370
147 seeking to classify maintenance being paid under an existing maintenance order as
148 bridge, rehabilitative, or durational or to shorten or lengthen the term of maintenance
149 beingpaid under anysuchorder,provided thatthetimelimits,public policystatements,
150 and other provisions of this section and section 452.370 shall control in all such actions
151 initiated under those sections, including, without limitation, the durational limits on
152 maintenance specified in this section. There shall be a presumption in favor of
153 modifying such existing orders to bring them into conformity with the provisions of this
154 section and section 452.370 and specifically the public policy set forth in this section and
155 section 452.370, and courts shall have the latitude to give credit for maintenance paid
156 under an existing order toward any modified maintenance term entered as part of a
157 modification order.
158 13. Nothing in this section shall be construed to prohibit parties from reaching
159 an agreement, submitted in writing to the court, regarding the type or duration of
160 modifiable or nonmodifiable maintenance, regardless of whether the duration of
161 maintenance in such agreement exceeds the limits described in this section.
452.370. 1. Except as otherwise provided in subsection 6 of section 452.325, and in
2 accordance with the provisions of section 452.335, the provisions of any judgment
3 respecting maintenance or support may be modified only upon a showing of [changed
HB 2851 6
4 circumstances so] substantial and continuing [as to make the terms unreasonable] changed
5 circumstances. In a proceeding for modification of any child support or maintenance
6 judgment,thecourt,indeterminingwhetherornot[a]substantial[changein]andcontinuing
7 changed circumstances [has] have occurred, shall consider all financial resources of both
8 parties, including the extent to which the reasonable expenses of either party are, or should
9 be,sharedbyaspouseorotherpersonwithwhomheorshecohabits,andtheearningcapacity
10 of a party who is not employed. If the application of the child support guidelines and criteria
11 set forth in section 452.340 and applicable supreme court rules to the financial circumstances
12 of the parties would result in a change of child support from the existing amount by twenty
13 percent or more, a prima facie showing has been made of [a change of circumstances so]
14 substantial and continuing [as to make the present terms unreasonable] changed
15 circumstances, if the existing amount was based upon the presumed amount pursuant to
16 the child support guidelines.
17 2. When the party seeking modification has met the burden of proof set forth in
18 subsection 1 of this section, the child support shall be determined in conformity with criteria
19 set forth in section 452.340 and applicable supreme court rules.
20 3. Unless otherwise agreed in writing or expressly provided in the judgment, the
21 obligation to pay future statutory maintenance is terminated upon the death of either party
22 [or], the remarriage of the party receiving maintenance, or if it can be shown that the party
23 receiving maintenance and another person are cohabitating or have entered into a
24 mutually supportive relationship that is the functional equivalent of marriage or
25 committed partnership that has existed for at least twelve months of an eighteen-month
26 period.
27 4. Unless otherwise agreed in writing or expressly provided in the judgment,
28 provisions for the support of a child are terminated by emancipation of the child. The parent
29 entitled to receive child support shall have the duty to notify the parent obligated to pay
30 support of the child's emancipation and failing to do so, the parent entitled to receive child
31 support shall be liable to the parent obligated to pay support for child support paid following
32 emancipation of a minor child, plus interest.
33 5. If a parent has made an assignment of support rights to the family support division
34 on behalf of the state as a condition of eligibility for benefits pursuant to the Temporary
35 Assistance for Needy Families program and either party initiates a motion to modify the
36 support obligation by reducing it, the state of Missouri shall be named as a party to the
37 proceeding. The state shall be served with a copy of the motion by sending it by certified
38 mail to the director of the family support division.
39 6. The court shall have continuing personal jurisdiction over both the obligee and the
40 obligor of a court order for child support or maintenance for the purpose of modifying such
HB 2851 7
41 order. Both obligee and obligor shall notify, in writing, the clerk of the court in which the
42 support or maintenance order was entered of any change of mailing address. If personal
43 service of the motion cannot be had in this state, the motion to modify and notice of hearing
44 shall be served outside the state as provided by supreme court rule 54.14. The order may be
45 modifiedonlyastosupportormaintenanceinstallmentswhichaccruedsubsequenttothedate
46 of personal service. For the purpose of 42 U.S.C. Section 666(a)(9)(C), the circuit clerk shall
47 be considered the appropriate agent to receive notice of the motion to modify for the obligee
48 or the obligor, but only in those instances in which personal service could not be had in this
49 state.
50 7. If a responsive pleading raising the issues of custody or visitation is filed in
51 response to a motion to modify child support filed at the request of the family support
52 division by a prosecuting attorney or circuit attorney or an attorney under contract with the
53 division, such responsive pleading shall be severed upon request.
54 8. Notwithstanding any provision of this section which requires a showing of
55 substantial and continuing [change in] changed circumstances, in a IV-D case filed pursuant
56 to this section by the family support division as provided in section 454.400, the court shall
57 modify a support order in accordance with the guidelines and criteria set forth in supreme
