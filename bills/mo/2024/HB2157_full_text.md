134 scope of the duties of the teacher, authorized district personnel or volunteer, when such
135 individual is acting in conformity with the established policies developed by the board.
136 Nothing in this section shall be construed to create a new cause of action against such school
137 district, or to relieve the school district from liability for the negligent acts of such persons.

139 other acts that constitute a serious violation of that policy. "Acts of violence" as defined by

145 to teachers and other school district employees with a need to know while acting within the

156 named in the alleged incident is the superintendent of schools, the president of the school
157 board of the school district where the alleged incident occurred.
158 12. In order to ensure the safety of all students, should a student be expelled for
159 bringing a weapon to school, violent behavior, or for an act of school violence, that student
160 shall not, for the purposes of the accreditation process of the Missouri school improvement
161 plan, be considered a dropout or be included in the calculation of that district's educational
162 persistence ratio.
163 13. The policy shall require notice that use of a wireless communications device
