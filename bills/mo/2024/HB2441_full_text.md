21 whereby the unincorporated area proposed to be annexed is contiguous to the annexing
22 city, town, or village by at least twenty-five percent of the length of the perimeter of the
23 area proposed for annexation. No city, town, or village shall annex an unincorporated
24 area contiguous to any unincorporated area annexed by the city, town, or village within
25 the last twenty-four months. Notwithstanding the provisions of this section, the governing
26 body of any city, town or village in any county of the third classification which borders a
27 county of the fourth classification, a county of the second classification and the Mississippi

33 pursuant to the provisions of this section if the correctional center is along a road or highway
34 within two miles from the existing boundaries of the city, town or village.
35 2. (1) When a notarized petition, requesting annexation and signed by the owners of
36 all fee interests of record in all tracts of real property located within the area proposed to be

38 common interest community and approved by a majority vote of unit owners located within
39 the area proposed to be annexed is presented to the governing body of the city, town or
40 village, the governing body shall hold a public hearing concerning the matter not less than
41 fourteen nor more than sixty days after the petition is received, and the hearing shall be held

47 community" shall mean a condominium as said term is used in chapter 448, or a common-
48 interest community, a cooperative, or a planned community.
49 (a) A "common-interest community" shall be defined as real property with respect to
50 which a person, by virtue of such person's ownership of a unit, is obliged to pay for real
51 property taxes, insurance premiums, maintenance or improvement of other real property
52 described in a declaration. "Ownership of a unit" does not include a leasehold interest of less

58 not a condominium or a cooperative. A condominium or cooperative may be part of a

60 (2) At the public hearing any interested person, corporation or political subdivision
61 may present evidence regarding the proposed annexation. If, after holding the hearing, the
62 governing body of the city, town or village determines that the annexation is reasonable and
63 necessary to the proper development of the city, town or village, and the city, town or village
64 has the ability to furnish normal municipal services to the area to be annexed within a
65 reasonable time, it may, subject to the provisions of subdivision (3) of this subsection, annex
66 the territory by ordinance without further action.

75 city, town or village shall cause three certified copies of the same to be filed with the county
76 assessor and the clerk of the county wherein the city, town or village is located, and one
77 certified copy to be filed with the election authority, if different from the clerk of the county
78 which has jurisdiction over the area being annexed, whereupon the annexation shall be
79 complete and final and thereafter all courts of this state shall take judicial notice of the limits
80 of that city, town or village as so extended.
81 4. That a petition requesting annexation is not or was not verified or notarized shall
82 not affect the validity of an annexation heretofore or hereafter undertaken in accordance with
83 this section.
