112 majority of active special education teachers residing in Missouri and other education
113 professionals as appropriate to research available assessment options. The advisory panel

115 shall, if necessary, develop alternate assessments and recommend one or more alternate
116 assessments for adoption by the state board. The state board shall consider the

120 to this subsection upon a determination by the student's individualized education program
