HB 2445 2
17 3. When determining the individual level of assessment of a parcel of real
18 property, the lesser of the assessor's appraised value, as verified pursuant to section
19 137.245, or the appraised value set by the local board of equalization shall be presumed
20 to be the actual true value in money for such real property, absent substantial and
21 persuasive evidence establishing a lower true value in money.
138.060. 1. The county board of equalization shall, in a summary way, determine all
2 appeals from the valuation of property made by the assessor, and shall correct and adjust the
3 assessment accordingly. There shall be no presumption that the assessor's valuation is
4 correct. In any county with a charter form of government with a population greater than two
5 hundred eighty thousand inhabitants but less than two hundred eighty-five thousand
6 inhabitants, in any county with a charter form of government with greater than one million
7 inhabitants, in any city not within a county, and in any other county for any property whose
8 assessed valuation increased at least fifteen percent from the previous assessment unless the
9 increase is due to new construction or improvement, the assessor shall have the burden to
10 prove that the assessor's valuation does not exceed the true market value of the subject
11 property. In such county or city, in the event a physical inspection of the subject property is
12 required by subsection 10 of section 137.115, the assessor shall have the burden to establish
13 the manner in which the physical inspection was performed and shall have the burden to
14 provethatthephysicalinspectionwasperformedinaccordancewithsection137.115. Insuch
15 county or city, in the event the assessor fails to provide sufficient evidence to establish that
16 the physical inspection was performed in accordance with section 137.115, the property
17 owner shall prevail on the appeal as a matter of law, and the assessor's increased assessed
18 valuation shall be void in its entirety, and the previous assessed valuation shall be
19 applied to the property in place of the increased assessed valuation. At any hearing
20 before the state tax commission or a court of competent jurisdiction of an appeal of
21 assessmentfromafirstclasschartercountyoracitynotwithinacounty,theassessorshallnot
22 advocate nor present evidence advocating a valuation higher than that value finally
23 determinedby theassessororthe valuedeterminedby theboard ofequalization,whicheveris
24 higher, for that assessment period.
25 2. Thecountyclerkshall keepan accuraterecordof theproceedingsand ordersofthe
26 board, and the assessor shall correct all erroneous assessments, and the clerk shall adjust the
27 tax book according to the orders of such board and the orders of the state tax commission,
28 except that in adding or deducting such percent to each tract or parcel of real estate as
29 required by such board or state tax commission, he shall add or deduct in each case any
30 fractional sum of less than fifty cents, so that the value of any separate tract shall contain no
31 fractions of a dollar.

138.434. In any first class charter county or a city not within a county [may require
2 by ordinance or charter the reimbursement to], a taxpayer [for the amount of just and
3 reasonable appraisal costs, attorney fees and court costs] shall be entitled to an award of all
4 attorney's fees and costs of litigation resulting from an evidentiary hearing before the state
5 tax commission or a court of competent jurisdiction, including but not limited to attorney's
6 fees, appraisal costs, witness fees, and court costs, whether paid directly by the taxpayer
7 or paid by an attorney, tax agent, or other third party, if such appeal results in a final
8 decision reducing the appraised value of residential property by at least fifteen percent or the
9 appraised value of utility, industrial railroad and other subclass three property by at least
10 twenty-five percent from the appraised value determined by the board of equalization for that
11 tax year. The commission or court awarding such fees and costs shall consider the
12 reasonableness of the fees and costs within the context of the particular case. Such fees and
13 costs shall not exceed [one] five thousand dollars for a residential property appeal. Such fees
14 and costs for utility, industrial railroad or other subclass three property appeals shall not
15 exceed the lesser of [four] five thousand dollars or twenty-five percent of the tax savings

43 erroneously levied against the taxpayer and collected in whole or in part by the collector.
44 Such application shall be filed within three years after the tax is mistakenly or erroneously
45 paid. The governing body, or other appropriate body or official of the county or city not

64 taxes which would be received by such taxing authority if the funds were not the subject of a
65 protest or dispute. Any taxing authority may apply to the circuit court of the county or city
66 not within a county in which a collector has impounded protested or disputed taxes under this
67 section and, upon a satisfactory showing that such taxing authority would receive such
68 impounded tax funds if they were not the subject of a protest or dispute and that such taxing

74 funds to the taxpayer. In the event that any protested or disputed tax funds refunded to a
75 taxpayer were disbursed to a taxing authority under this subsection instead of being held and

80 of interest shall only apply to protested or disputed tax funds actually distributed to a taxing
81 authority pursuant to this subsection. In the event of a refund of protested or disputed tax
82 funds which remain impounded by the collector, the taxpayer shall instead be entitled to the
83 interest actually earned on those refunded impounded tax funds under subsection 7 of this
84 section. Any sovereign or official immunity otherwise applicable to the taxing authorities is
85 hereby waived for all purposes related to this subsection, and the taxpayer is expressly
86 authorized to seek an order enforcing this provision from the circuit court that originally
87 ordered the distribution of the protested or disputed funds, or directly from the state tax
88 commission, if the tax appeal that resulted in the refund was heard and determined by the
89 state tax commission.
