3 2. (1) There is hereby created in the state treasury the "Matching Grants for
4 Teachers Plan Fund", which shall consist of moneys appropriated under this section.
5 The state treasurer shall be custodian of the fund. In accordance with sections 30.170

18 appropriated under this section shall exceed the total amount necessary to provide each
19 school district with up to one million dollars for matching grants under this section.
20 4. Any school district that uses such district's reserves to increase teacher
21 salaries may apply to the department of elementary and secondary education for a
22 matching grant of moneys from the matching grants for teachers plan fund to assist
23 such district in increasing teacher salaries. An amount granted to a school district from
24 the matching grants for teachers plan fund shall be equal to the total amount such
25 district withdraws from such district's reserves and uses solely to increase teacher
26 salaries.
27 5. No school district shall receive a total of more than one million dollars
28 annually under this section.
29 6. No school district shall exhaust all of such district's reserves to increase
30 teacher salaries for the purpose of receiving matching grants under this section. No
31 school district shall deplete such district's reserves below the amount required to be
32 maintained by state law or regulations.
33 7. The department may promulgate all necessary rules and regulations for the
34 administration of this section. Any rule or portion of a rule, as that term is defined in
35 section 536.010, that is created under the authority delegated in this section shall
36 become effective only if it complies with and is subject to all of the provisions of chapter
37 536 and, if applicable, section 536.028. This section and chapter 536 are nonseverable
38 and if any of the powers vested with the general assembly pursuant to chapter 536 to
39 review, to delay the effective date, or to disapprove and annul a rule are subsequently
40 held unconstitutional, then the grant of rulemaking authority and any rule proposed or
41 adopted after August 28, 2024, shall be invalid and void.
