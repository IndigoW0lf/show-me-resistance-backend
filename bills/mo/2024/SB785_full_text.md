84 miles of the site of such work.
85 3. (1) The department may award tax credits to a
86 qualified manufacturing company that makes a manufacturing
87 capital investment of at least five hundred million dollars
88 not more than three years following the department's
89 approval of a notice of intent and the execution of an
90 agreement that meets the requirements of subsection 4 of
91 this section. Such tax credits shall be issued no earlier
92 than January 1, 2023, and may be issued each year for a
93 period of five years. A qualified manufacturing company may
94 qualify for an additional five-year period under this
95 subsection if it makes an additional manufacturing capital
96 investment of at least two hundred fifty million dollars
97 within five years of the department's approval of the
98 original notice of intent.
99 (2) The maximum amount of tax credits that any one

102 calendar year. The aggregate amount of tax credits awarded
103 to all qualified manufacturing companies under this
104 subsection shall not exceed ten million dollars per calendar
105 year.
106 (3) If, at the project facility at any time during the
107 project period, the qualified manufacturing company
108 discontinues the manufacturing of the new product, or
109 discontinues the modification or expansion of an existing
110 product, and does not replace it with a subsequent or
111 additional new product or with a modification or expansion
112 of an existing product, the company shall immediately cease
SB 785 18
113 receiving any benefit awarded under this subsection for the
114 remainder of the project period and shall forfeit all rights
115 to retain or receive any benefit awarded under this
116 subsection for the remainder of such period.
117 (4) Notwithstanding any other provision of law to the
118 contrary, any qualified manufacturing company that is
119 awarded benefits under this section shall not simultaneously
120 receive tax credits or exemptions under sections 100.700 to
121 100.850 for the jobs created or retained or capital
122 improvement that qualified for benefits under this section.
123 The provisions of subsection 5 of section 285.530 shall not
124 apply to a qualified manufacturing company that is awarded
125 benefits under this section.
126 4. Upon approval of a notice of intent to receive tax
127 credits under subsection 2, 3, 6, or 7 of this section, the
128 department and the qualified company shall enter into a
129 written agreement covering the applicable project period.
130 The agreement shall specify, at a minimum:
131 (1) The committed number of new jobs, new payroll, and
132 new capital investment, or the manufacturing capital
133 investment and committed percentage of retained jobs for
134 each year during the project period;
135 (2) The date or time period during which the tax
136 credits shall be issued, which may be immediately or over a
137 period not to exceed two years from the date of approval of
138 the notice of intent;
139 (3) Clawback provisions, as may be required by the
140 department;
141 (4) Financial guarantee provisions as may be required
142 by the department, provided that financial guarantee
143 provisions shall be required by the department for tax
144 credits awarded under subsection 7 of this section; and
SB 785 19
145 (5) Any other provisions the department may require.
146 5. In lieu of the benefits available under subsections
147 1 and 2 of this section, and in exchange for the
148 consideration provided by the new tax revenues and other
149 economic stimuli that will be generated by the new jobs
150 created by the program, a qualified company may, for a
151 period of five years from the date the new jobs are created,
152 or for a period of six years from the date the new jobs are
153 created if the qualified company is an existing Missouri
154 business, retain an amount equal to the withholding tax as
155 calculated under subdivision (38) of section 620.2005 from
156 the new jobs that would otherwise be withheld and remitted
157 by the qualified company under the provisions of sections
158 143.191 to 143.265 equal to:
159 (1) Six percent of new [payroll] taxable wages for a
160 period of five years from the date the required number of
161 new jobs were created if the qualified company creates one
162 hundred or more new jobs and the average wage of the new
163 payroll equals or exceeds one hundred twenty percent of the
164 county average wage of the county in which the project
165 facility is located; or
166 (2) Seven percent of new [payroll] taxable wages for a
167 period of five years from the date the required number of
168 jobs were created if the qualified company creates one
169 hundred or more new jobs and the average wage of the new
170 payroll equals or exceeds one hundred forty percent of the
171 county average wage of the county in which the project
172 facility is located.
173 The department shall issue a refundable tax credit for any
174 difference between the amount of benefit allowed under this
175 subsection and the amount of withholding tax retained by the
SB 785 20
176 company, in the event the withholding tax is not sufficient
177 to provide the entire amount of benefit due to the qualified
178 company under this subsection.
179 6. In addition to the benefits available under
180 subsection 5 of this section, the department may award a
181 qualified company that satisfies the provisions of
182 subsection 5 of this section additional tax credits, issued
183 each year for a period of five years from the date the new
184 jobs are created, or for a period of six years from the date
185 the new jobs are created if the qualified company is an
186 existing Missouri business, in an amount equal to or less
187 than three percent of new [payroll] taxable wages; provided
188 that in no event may the total amount of benefits awarded to
189 a qualified company under this section exceed nine percent
190 of new [payroll] taxable wages in any calendar year. The
191 amount of tax credits awarded to a qualified company under
192 this subsection shall not exceed the projected net fiscal
193 benefit to the state, as determined by the department, and
194 shall not exceed the least amount necessary to obtain the
195 qualified company's commitment to initiate the project. In
196 determining the amount of tax credits to award to a
197 qualified company under this subsection, the department
198 shall consider the factors provided under subsection 2 of
199 this section.
200 7. In lieu of the benefits available under subsections
201 1, 2, 5, and 6 of this section, and in exchange for the
202 consideration provided by the new tax revenues and other
203 economic stimuli that will be generated by the new jobs and
204 new capital investment created by the program, the
205 department may award a qualified company that satisfies the
206 provisions of subdivision (1) of subsection 1 of this
207 section tax credits, issued within one year following the
SB 785 21
208 qualified company's acceptance of the department's proposal
209 for benefits, in an amount equal to or less than nine
210 percent of new [payroll] taxable wages. The amount of tax
211 credits awarded to a qualified company under this subsection
212 shall not exceed the projected net fiscal benefit to the
213 state, as determined by the department, and shall not exceed
214 the least amount necessary to obtain the qualified company's
215 commitment to initiate the project. In determining the
216 amount of tax credits to award to a qualified company under
217 this subsection, the department shall consider the factors
218 provided under subsection 2 of this section and the
219 qualified company's commitment to new capital investment and
220 new job creation within the state for a period of not less
221 than ten years. For the purposes of this subsection, each
222 qualified company shall have an average wage of the new
223 payroll that equals or exceeds one hundred percent of the
224 county average wage. Notwithstanding the provisions of
225 section 620.2020 to the contrary, this subsection shall
226 expire on June 30, 2025.
227 8. No benefits shall be available under this section
228 for any qualified company that has performed significant,
229 project-specific site work at the project facility,
230 purchased machinery or equipment related to the project, or
231 has publicly announced its intention to make new capital
232 investment or manufacturing capital investment at the
233 project facility prior to receipt of a proposal for benefits
234 under this section or approval of its notice of intent,
235 whichever occurs first.
236 9. In lieu of any other benefits under this chapter,
237 the department of economic development may award a tax
238 credit to an industrial development authority for a
239 qualified military project in an amount equal to the
SB 785 22
240 estimated withholding taxes associated with the part-time
241 and full-time civilian and military new jobs located at the
242 facility and directly impacted by the project. The amount
243 of the tax credit shall be calculated by multiplying:
244 (1) The average percentage of tax withheld, as
245 provided by the department of revenue to the department of
246 economic development;
247 (2) The average [salaries] taxable wages of the jobs
248 directly created by the qualified military project; and
249 (3) The number of jobs directly created by the
250 qualified military project.
251 If the amount of the tax credit represents the least amount
252 necessary to accomplish the qualified military project, the
253 tax credits may be issued, but no tax credits shall be
254 issued for a term longer than fifteen years. No qualified
255 military project shall be eligible for tax credits under
256 this subsection unless the department of economic
257 development determines the qualified military project shall
258 achieve a net positive fiscal impact to the state.
