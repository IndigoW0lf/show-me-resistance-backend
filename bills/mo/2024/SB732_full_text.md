190 fingerprinted. No other biometric data shall be collected
191 from the applicant. The sheriff shall conduct an inquiry of

193 three working days after submission of the properly
194 completed application for a concealed carry permit. If no
195 disqualifying record is identified by these checks at the

197 Federal Bureau of Investigation for a national criminal
198 history record check. Upon receipt of the completed report
199 from the National Instant Criminal Background Check System
200 and the response from the Federal Bureau of Investigation
201 national criminal history record check, the sheriff shall
202 examine the results and, if no disqualifying information is
203 identified, shall issue a concealed carry permit within
204 three working days.
205 (2) In the event the report from the National Instant
206 Criminal Background Check System and the response from the
207 Federal Bureau of Investigation national criminal history
208 record check prescribed by subdivision (1) of this
SB 732 8
209 subsection are not completed within forty-five calendar days
210 and no disqualifying information concerning the applicant
211 has otherwise come to the sheriff's attention, the sheriff
212 shall issue a provisional permit, clearly designated on the
213 certificate as such, which the applicant shall sign in the
214 presence of the sheriff or the sheriff's designee. This
215 permit, when carried with a valid Missouri driver's or
216 nondriver's license or a valid military identification,
217 shall permit the applicant to exercise the same rights in
218 accordance with the same conditions as pertain to a
219 concealed carry permit issued under this section, provided
220 that it shall not serve as an alternative to an national
221 instant criminal background check required by 18 U.S.C.
222 Section 922(t). The provisional permit shall remain valid
223 until such time as the sheriff either issues or denies the
224 certificate of qualification under subsection 6 or 7 of this
225 section. The sheriff shall revoke a provisional permit
226 issued under this subsection within twenty-four hours of
227 receipt of any report that identifies a disqualifying
228 record, and shall notify the concealed carry permit system
229 established under subsection 5 of section 650.350. The
230 revocation of a provisional permit issued under this section
231 shall be proscribed in a manner consistent to the denial and
232 review of an application under subsection 6 of this section.
233 6. The sheriff may refuse to approve an application
234 for a concealed carry permit if he or she determines that
235 any of the requirements specified in subsection 2 of this
236 section have not been met, or if he or she has a substantial
237 and demonstrable reason to believe that the applicant has
238 rendered a false statement regarding any of the provisions
239 of sections 571.101 to 571.121. If the applicant is found
240 to be ineligible, the sheriff is required to deny the
SB 732 9
241 application, and notify the applicant in writing, stating
242 the grounds for denial and informing the applicant of the
243 right to submit, within thirty days, any additional
244 documentation relating to the grounds of the denial. Upon
245 receiving any additional documentation, the sheriff shall
246 reconsider his or her decision and inform the applicant
247 within thirty days of the result of the reconsideration.
248 The applicant shall further be informed in writing of the
249 right to appeal the denial pursuant to subsections 2, 3, 4,
250 and 5 of section 571.114. After two additional reviews and
251 denials by the sheriff, the person submitting the
252 application shall appeal the denial pursuant to subsections
253 2, 3, 4, and 5 of section 571.114.

272 permit system county code and shall be stored in sequential
273 number.
274 9. (1) The sheriff shall keep a record of all
275 applications for a concealed carry permit or a provisional
276 permit and his or her action thereon. Any record of an
277 application that is incomplete or denied for any reason
278 shall be kept for a period not to exceed one year. Any
279 record of an application that was approved shall be kept for
280 a period of one year after the expiration and nonrenewal of
281 the permit.
282 (2) The sheriff shall report the issuance of a
283 concealed carry permit or provisional permit to the
284 concealed carry permit system. All information on any such
285 permit that is protected information on any driver's or
286 nondriver's license shall have the same personal protection
287 for purposes of sections 571.101 to 571.121. An applicant's
288 status as a holder of a concealed carry permit, provisional
289 permit, or a concealed carry endorsement issued prior to
290 August 28, 2013, shall not be public information and shall
291 be considered personal protected information. Information
292 retained in the concealed carry permit system under this
293 subsection shall not be distributed to any federal, state,
294 or private entities and shall only be made available for a
295 single entry query of an individual in the event the
296 individual is a subject of interest in an active criminal
297 investigation or is arrested for a crime. A sheriff may

299 purposes to issue a permit, verify the accuracy of permit
300 holder information, change the name or address of a permit
301 holder, suspend or revoke a permit, cancel an expired
302 permit, or cancel a permit upon receipt of a certified death
303 certificate for the permit holder. Any person who violates
SB 732 11
304 the provisions of this subdivision by disclosing protected
305 information shall be guilty of a class A misdemeanor.

307 carry permit, or a concealed carry endorsement issued prior

160 5. An application for a Missouri lifetime or extended
161 concealed carry permit shall be made to the sheriff of the
162 county in which the applicant resides. An application shall
163 be filed in writing, signed under oath and under the
164 penalties of perjury, and shall state whether the applicant
165 complies with each of the requirements specified in
166 subsection 3 of this section. In addition to the completed
167 application, the applicant for a Missouri lifetime or
168 extended concealed carry permit shall also submit the

176 6. (1) Before an application for a Missouri lifetime
177 or extended concealed carry permit is approved, the sheriff
178 shall make only such inquiries as he or she deems necessary
179 into the accuracy of the statements made in the
180 application. The sheriff may require that the applicant
181 display a Missouri driver's license or nondriver's license

184 inquiry of the National Instant Criminal Background Check
185 System within three working days after submission of the
186 properly completed application for a Missouri lifetime or
187 extended concealed carry permit. Upon receipt of the

189 Background Check System, the sheriff shall examine the
190 results and, if no disqualifying information is identified,
191 shall issue a Missouri lifetime or extended concealed carry
192 permit within three working days.
193 (2) In the event the report from the National Instant
194 Criminal Background Check System and the response from the
195 Federal Bureau of Investigation national criminal history
196 record check prescribed by subdivision (1) of this
197 subsection are not completed within forty-five calendar days
198 and no disqualifying information concerning the applicant
199 has otherwise come to the sheriff's attention, the sheriff
200 shall issue a provisional permit, clearly designated on the
201 certificate as such, which the applicant shall sign in the
202 presence of the sheriff or the sheriff's designee. This
203 permit, when carried with a valid Missouri driver's or
204 nondriver's license, shall permit the applicant to exercise
205 the same rights in accordance with the same conditions as
206 pertain to a Missouri lifetime or extended concealed carry
207 permit issued under this section, provided that it shall not
208 serve as an alternative to a national instant criminal
209 background check required by 18 U.S.C. Section 922(t). The
210 provisional permit shall remain valid until such time as the
211 sheriff either issues or denies the permit under subsection
212 7 or 8 of this section. The sheriff shall revoke a
213 provisional permit issued under this subsection within
SB 732 19
214 twenty-four hours of receipt of any report that identifies a
215 disqualifying record, and shall notify the concealed carry
216 permit system established under subsection 5 of section
217 650.350. The revocation of a provisional permit issued
218 under this section shall be prescribed in a manner
219 consistent to the denial and review of an application under
220 subsection 7 of this section.
221 7. The sheriff may refuse to approve an application
222 for a Missouri lifetime or extended concealed carry permit
223 if he or she determines that any of the requirements
224 specified in subsection 3 of this section have not been met,
225 or if he or she has a substantial and demonstrable reason to
226 believe that the applicant has rendered a false statement
227 regarding any of the provisions of sections 571.205 to
228 571.230. If the applicant is found to be ineligible, the
229 sheriff is required to deny the application, and notify the
230 applicant in writing, stating the grounds for denial and
231 informing the applicant of the right to submit, within
232 thirty days, any additional documentation relating to the
233 grounds of the denial. Upon receiving any additional
234 documentation, the sheriff shall reconsider his or her
235 decision and inform the applicant within thirty days of the
236 result of the reconsideration. The applicant shall further
237 be informed in writing of the right to appeal the denial
238 under section 571.220. After two additional reviews and
239 denials by the sheriff, the person submitting the
240 application shall appeal the denial under section 571.220.
241 8. If the application is approved, the sheriff shall
242 issue a Missouri lifetime or extended concealed carry permit
243 to the applicant within a period not to exceed three working
244 days after his or her approval of the application. The
245 applicant shall sign the Missouri lifetime or extended
SB 732 20
246 concealed carry permit in the presence of the sheriff or his
247 or her designee.
248 9. The Missouri lifetime or extended concealed carry
249 permit shall specify only the following information:
250 (1) Name, address, date of birth, gender, height,
251 weight, color of hair, color of eyes, and signature of the
252 permit holder;
253 (2) The signature of the sheriff issuing the permit;
254 (3) The date of issuance;
255 (4) A clear statement indicating that the permit is
256 only valid within the state of Missouri; and
257 (5) If the permit is a Missouri extended concealed
258 carry permit, the expiration date.
259 The permit shall be no larger than two and one-eighth inches
260 wide by three and three-eighths inches long and shall be of
261 a uniform style prescribed by the department of public
262 safety. The permit shall also be assigned a concealed carry
263 permit system county code and shall be stored in sequential
264 number.
265 10. (1) The sheriff shall keep a record of all
266 applications for a Missouri lifetime or extended concealed
267 carry permit or a provisional permit and his or her action
268 thereon. Any record of an application that is incomplete or
269 denied for any reason shall be kept for a period not to
270 exceed one year.
271 (2) The sheriff shall report the issuance of a
272 Missouri lifetime or extended concealed carry permit or
273 provisional permit to the concealed carry permit system.
274 All information on any such permit that is protected
275 information on any driver's or nondriver's license shall
276 have the same personal protection for purposes of sections
SB 732 21
277 571.205 to 571.230. An applicant's status as a holder of a
278 Missouri lifetime or extended concealed carry permit or
279 provisional permit shall not be public information and shall
280 be considered personal protected information. Information
281 retained in the concealed carry permit system under this
282 subsection shall not be distributed to any federal, state,
283 or private entities and shall only be made available for a
284 single entry query of an individual in the event the
285 individual is a subject of interest in an active criminal
286 investigation or is arrested for a crime. A sheriff may
287 access the concealed carry permit system for administrative
288 purposes to issue a permit, verify the accuracy of permit
289 holder information, change the name or address of a permit
290 holder, suspend or revoke a permit, cancel an expired
291 permit, or cancel a permit upon receipt of a certified death
292 certificate for the permit holder. Any person who violates
293 the provisions of this subdivision by disclosing protected
294 information shall be guilty of a class A misdemeanor.
295 11. Information regarding any holder of a Missouri
296 lifetime or extended concealed carry permit is a closed
297 record. No bulk download or batch data shall be distributed
298 to any federal, state, or private entity, except to MoSMART
299 or a designee thereof.
300 12. For processing an application, the sheriff in each
301 county shall charge a nonrefundable fee not to exceed:
302 (1) Two hundred dollars for a new Missouri extended
303 concealed carry permit that is valid for ten years from the
304 date of issuance or renewal;
305 (2) Two hundred fifty dollars for a new Missouri
306 extended concealed carry permit that is valid for twenty-
307 five years from the date of issuance or renewal;

309 concealed carry permit;
