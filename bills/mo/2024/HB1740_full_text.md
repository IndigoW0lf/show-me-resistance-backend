160.518. 1. Consistent with the provisions contained in section 160.526, the state
2 board of education shall develop, modify, and revise, as necessary, a statewide assessment
3 system that provides maximum flexibility for local school districts to determine the degree to
4 which students in the public schools of the state are proficient in the knowledge, skills, and
5 competencies adopted by such board pursuant to section 160.514. The statewide assessment
6 system shall assess problem solving, analytical ability, evaluation, creativity, and application
7 ability in the different content areas and shall be performance-based to identify what students
8 know, as well as what they are able to do, and shall enable teachers to evaluate actual
9 academic performance. The statewide assessment system shall neither promote nor prohibit
10 rotememorizationandshallnotincludeexistingversionsoftestsapprovedforusepursuantto
11 the provisions of section 160.257, nor enhanced versions of such tests. After the state board
12 of education adopts and implements academic performance standards as required under
13 section 161.855, the state board of education shall develop and adopt a standardized
14 assessment instrument under this section based on the academic performance standards
15 adopted under section 161.855. The statewide assessment system shall measure, where

20 students in each school in the state to be tracked against prior academic performance in the
21 same school.
22 3. The state board of education shall suggest, but not mandate, criteria for a school to
23 demonstrate that its students learn the knowledge, skills and competencies at exemplary
24 levels worthy of imitation by students in other schools in the state and nation. Exemplary
25 levels shall be measured by the statewide assessment system developed pursuant to
26 subsection 1 of this section, or until said statewide assessment system is available, by
27 indicators approved for such use by the state board of education. The provisions of other law
28 to the contrary notwithstanding, the commissioner of education may, upon request of the
29 school district, present a plan for the waiver of rules and regulations to any such school, to be
30 known as "Outstanding Schools Waivers", consistent with the provisions of subsection 4 of
31 this section.

35 a plan to the superintendent of the school district in which such school is located for the
36 waiver of rules and regulations to promote flexibility in the operations of the school and to
37 enhance and encourage efficiency in the delivery of instructional services. The provisions of
38 other law to the contrary notwithstanding, the plan presented to the superintendent shall
39 provide a summary waiver, with no conditions, for the pupil testing requirements pursuant to
40 section 160.257, in the school. Further, the provisions of other law to the contrary
41 notwithstanding, the plan shall detail a means for the waiver of requirements otherwise
42 imposed on the school related to the authority of the state board of education to classify
43 school districts pursuant to subdivision (9) of section 161.092 and such other rules and
44 regulations as determined by the commissioner of education, excepting such waivers shall be
45 confined to the school and not other schools in the district unless such other schools meet the
46 criteria established by the state board of education consistent with subsection 3 of this section
47 and the waivers shall not include the requirements contained in this section and section
48 160.514. Any waiver provided to any school as outlined in this subsection shall be void on
49 June thirtieth of any school year in which the school fails to meet the criteria established by
50 the state board of education consistent with subsection 3 of this section.
51 5. The score on any assessment test developed pursuant to this section or this chapter
52 of any student for whom English is a second language shall not be counted until such time as

53 such student has been educated for three full school years in a school in this state, or in any
54 other state, in which English is the primary language.
55 6. The state board of education shall identify or, if necessary, establish one or more

58 development of such alternate assessments, the state board shall establish an advisory
59 panel consisting of a majority of active special education teachers residing in Missouri and
60 other education professionals as appropriate to research available assessment options. The
61 advisory panel shall attempt to identify preexisting developmentally appropriate alternate
62 assessments but shall, if necessary, develop alternate assessments and recommend one or
63 morealternate assessments for adoption by thestate board. Thestate board shall considerthe

65 assessments. Any student who receives special educational services, as that term is defined
66 pursuant tosection 162.675, shall beassessed byan alternate assessment establishedpursuant
67 to this subsection upon a determination by the student's individualized education program
68 team that such alternate assessment is more appropriate to assess the student's knowledge,
69 skills and competencies than the assessment developed pursuant to subsection 1 of this
70 section. The alternate assessment shall evaluate the student's independent living skills, which
71 includehow effectivelythestudent addressescommonlifedemandsand howwellthe student
