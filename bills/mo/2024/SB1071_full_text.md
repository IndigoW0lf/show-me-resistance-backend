18 other charges of any nature shall be permitted except as
19 provided by this section, including any charges for cashing

22 amount of accumulated interest and fees in excess of seventy-
23 five percent of the initial loan amount on any single loan
24 authorized pursuant to this section for the entire term of
25 that loan and all renewals authorized by section 408.500 and
26 this section.]
27 4. A loan made pursuant to the provisions of section

54 7. No state or public employee or official, including
55 a judge of any court of this state, shall enforce the

58 408.500 and this section.
59 8. A person does not commit the crime of passing a bad
60 check pursuant to section 570.120 if at the time the payee
61 accepts a check or similar sight order for the payment of
62 money, he or she does so with the understanding that the
63 payee will not present it for payment until later and the
64 payee knows or has reason to believe that there are
65 insufficient funds on deposit with the drawee at the time of
66 acceptance. However, this section shall not apply if the
67 person's account on which the instrument was written was
68 closed by the consumer before the agreed-upon date of
69 negotiation or the consumer has stopped payment on the check.
