130 recycling of architectural paint; and
131 (g) Establish a per-container cost to be added to
132 architectural paint sold in this state as a result of the
133 program. This per-container cost, known as the paint
134 assessment fee, shall be reviewed by an independent
135 financial auditor to assure that any added cost to paint
136 sold in this state as a result of the program does not
137 exceed the costs to operate and sustain the program in
138 accordance with sound management practices;
139 (h) Describe how the program will incorporate and
140 compensate service providers for activities conducted under
141 the program that may include:

153 auditor shall verify that the cost added to each unit of
154 paint will cover the costs of the program. The department
155 shall review the work product of the independent financial
156 auditor. The cost of any work performed by such independent
157 financial auditor shall be funded by the paint assessment
158 fees authorized by the program.
159 (4) Each manufacturer under the plan shall include in
160 the price of any architectural paint sold to retailers or
161 distributors in the state the per container amount of the
162 fee set forth in the plan or fee adjustment. If a
163 representative organization implements the plan for a
164 manufacturer, the manufacturer shall be responsible for
165 filing, reporting, and remitting any fee assessed under this
166 section for each container of architectural paint to the
167 representative organization. A retailer or distributor
168 shall not deduct the amount of the fee from the purchase
169 price of any architectural paint the retailer or distributor
170 sells.
171 (5) No later than sixty days after the submission of a
172 plan under this section, the director shall make a written

SB 936 7
177 items. Within sixty days following receipt of the

182 (6) The department shall enforce the producer's or the
183 representative organization's compliance with the plan and
184 may, by regulation or by using existing regulations
185 promulgated under sections 260.230, 260.240, and 260.249,
186 establish enforcement procedures and penalties.
187 (7) No later than the implementation date of the
188 program, information regarding the approved plan, the names
189 of participating producers, and the brands of architectural
190 paint covered by the program shall be posted on the
191 department's website and on the website of the
192 representative organization.
193 (8) The plan required under this subsection shall be
194 submitted to the department not later than twelve months
195 after the effective date of this section. The department
196 may, for good cause shown, grant an extension of the
197 deadline for submission.
198 (9) Nothing in this section shall be construed to
199 require the department to develop the plan or establish the
200 program authorized under this section. Such requirement
201 shall be the sole responsibility of the producers or
202 representative organization.
203 (10) Nothing in this section shall require a retailer
204 to track, file, report, submit, or remit a fee assessed

207 organization. Nothing in this section shall prohibit a
SB 936 8
208 manufacturer and a retailer from entering into remitter
209 agreements.
210 4. (1) The department shall establish an
211 administrative fee to be paid by each producer or
212 representative organization submitting a plan under this
213 section. The department shall set the fee at an amount
214 that, when paid by every producer or representative
215 organization that submits a plan, is adequate to reimburse
216 the department's full costs of administering this section.
217 The total amount of annual fees collected under this
218 subdivision shall not exceed the amount necessary to
219 reimburse costs incurred by the department to administer
220 this section. The department may consider relevant factors
221 when establishing the fee including, but not limited to, the
222 portion of architectural paint sold in the state by the
223 producer or the members of the representative organization
224 compared to the total amount of architectural paint sold in
225 the state by all producers or representative organizations
226 submitting a plan.
227 (2) Each producer or representative organization
228 implementing a plan under this section shall pay the
229 administrative fee required in subdivision (1) of this
230 subsection on or before July 1, 2025, and annually
231 thereafter. Each year after the initial payment, the annual
232 administrative fee shall not exceed five percent of the
233 aggregate program fee added to the cost of all architectural
234 paint sold by producers in the state for the preceding
235 calendar year. The department may extend the time for
236 payment upon good cause shown.
237 5. Upon implementation of the program, each producer
238 shall include in the price of any architectural paint sold
239 to retailers and distributors in this state the per-

241 approved plan. No retailer or distributor shall deduct such
242 amount from the purchase price.
243 6. (1) After the program is implemented, no producer
244 or retailer shall sell or offer for sale architectural paint
245 to any person in this state unless the producer of a paint
246 brand or a representative organization is implementing or
247 participating in the program as required by this section.
248 (2) A retailer shall be deemed to be in compliance
249 with this section if, on the date the architectural paint
250 was offered for sale, the producer is listed on the
251 department's website as implementing or participating in the
252 program or if the paint brand is listed on the department's
253 website as being included in the program.
254 (3) A paint collection site authorized under this
255 section shall not charge any additional amount for the
256 disposal of paint when the paint is offered for disposal.
257 (4) A producer or the representative organization that
258 organizes the collection, transport, and processing of post-
259 consumer paint in accordance with the program shall not be
260 liable for any claim of a violation of antitrust, restraint
261 of trade, unfair trade practice, or other anticompetitive
262 activity arising from conduct undertaken in accordance with
263 the program under this section.
264 (5) Before March thirty-first of each year, the
265 producers or representative organization shall submit an
266 annual report for the previous year to the director that
267 details the program. The first report shall be submitted

290 not disclose financial, production, or sales data of the
291 producer, retailer, or representative organization.
292 (7) The producers or the representative organization
293 shall implement the program required under this section on

304 applicable requirements of state laws or regulations.
305 (3) Nothing in this section shall be construed to
306 restrict the collection of architectural paint by a program
307 where such collection is authorized by any other state laws
308 or regulations.
309 (4) Nothing in this section shall be construed to
310 affect any requirements applicable to facilities that treat,
311 dispose, or recycle architectural paint under any other
312 state laws or regulations.
313 8. The director may promulgate all necessary rules and
314 regulations for the administration of this section. Any
315 rule or portion of a rule, as that term is defined in
316 section 536.010, that is created under the authority
317 delegated in this section shall become effective only if it
318 complies with and is subject to all of the provisions of
319 chapter 536 and, if applicable, section 536.028. This
320 section and chapter 536 are nonseverable and if any of the
321 powers vested with the general assembly pursuant to chapter
322 536 to review, to delay the effective date, or to disapprove
323 and annul a rule are subsequently held unconstitutional,
324 then the grant of rulemaking authority and any rule proposed
325 or adopted after August 28, 2024, shall be invalid and void.
