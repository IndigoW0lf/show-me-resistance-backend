2 enacted in lieu thereof, to be known as sections 302.309 and 302.341, to read as follows:
302.309. 1. Whenever any license is suspended pursuant to sections 302.302 to
2 302.309, the director of revenue shall return the license to the operator immediately upon the
3 termination of the period of suspension and upon compliance with the requirements of
4 chapter 303.

25 on the operator,
26
27 the court or director may grant such limited driving privilege as the circumstances of the case
28 justify if the court or director finds undue hardship would result to the individual, and while
29 so operating a motor vehicle within the restrictions and limitations of the limited driving
30 privilege the driver shall not be guilty of operating a motor vehicle without a valid license.
31 (3) An operatormay makeapplication tothe proper court inthe countyin whichsuch
32 operator resides or in the county in which is located the operator's principal place of business
33 or employment. Any application for a limited driving privilege made to a circuit court shall
34 name the director as a party defendant and shall be served upon the director prior to the grant
35 of any limited privilege, and shall be accompanied by a copy of the applicant's driving record
36 as certified by the director. Any applicant for a limited driving privilege shall have on file
37 with the department of revenue proof of financial responsibility as required by chapter 303.
38 Any application by a person who transports persons or property as classified in section
39 302.015 may be accompanied by proof of financial responsibility as required by chapter 303,
40 but if proof of financial responsibility does not accompany the application, or if the applicant
41 does not have on file with the department of revenue proof of financial responsibility, the
42 court or the director has discretion to grant the limited driving privilege to the person solely
43 for the purpose of operating a vehicle whose owner has complied with chapter 303 for that
44 vehicle, and the limited driving privilege must state such restriction. When operating such
45 vehicle under such restriction the person shall carry proof that the owner has complied with
46 chapter 303 for that vehicle.

51 revocation under subdivision (2) of subsection 2 of section 302.525, or section 302.574 or
52 577.041, until the applicant has filed proof with the department of revenue that any motor
53 vehicle operated by the person is equipped with a functioning, certified ignition interlock
54 device as a required condition of limited driving privilege. The ignition interlock device
HB 1794 3
55 requiredfor obtaininga limited driving privilegeunder paragraph(a) or (b) ofsubdivision(8)
56 of this subsection shall have a photo identification technology feature, and a court may
57 require a global positioning system feature for such device.
58 (5) The court order or the director's grant of the limited or restricted driving privilege
59 shall indicate the termination date of the privilege, which shall be not laterthan the end of the
60 period of suspension or revocation. The court order or the director's grant of the limited or
61 restricted driving privilege shall also indicate whether a functioning, certified ignition
62 interlock device is required as a condition of operating a motor vehicle with the limited
63 driving privilege. A copy of any court order shall be sent by the clerk of the court to the
64 director, and a copy shall be given to the driver which shall be carried by the driver whenever
65 such driver operates a motor vehicle. The director of revenue upon granting a limited driving
66 privilege shall give a copy of the limited driving privilege to the applicant. The applicant
67 shall carry a copy of the limited driving privilege while operating a motor vehicle. A
68 conviction which results in the assessment of points pursuant to section 302.302, other than a
69 violation of a municipal stop sign ordinance where no accident is involved, against a driver
70 who is operating a vehicle pursuant to a limited driving privilege terminates the privilege, as
71 of the date the points are assessed to the person's driving record. If the date of arrest is prior
72 to the issuance of the limited driving privilege, the privilege shall not be terminated. Failure
73 of the driver to maintain proof of financial responsibility, as required by chapter 303, or to
74 maintain proof of installation of a functioning, certified ignition interlock device, as
75 applicable, shall terminate the privilege. The director shall notify by ordinary mail the driver
76 whose privilege is so terminated.
77 (6) Except as provided in subdivision (8) of this subsection, no person is eligible to
78 receive a limited driving privilege whose license at the time of application has been
79 suspended or revoked for the following reasons:
80 (a) A conviction of any felony in the commission of which a motor vehicle was used
81 and such conviction occurred within the five-year period prior to the date of application.
82 However, any felony conviction for leaving the scene of an accident under section 577.060
83 shall not render the applicant ineligible for a limited driving privilege under this section;
84 (b) Ineligibilityfora licensebecause ofthe provisionsofsubdivision(1), (2),(4),(5),
85 (6), (7), (8), (9), or (10) of subsection 1 of section 302.060; or

87 302.302 or subsection 2 of section 302.525.
88 (7) No person who possesses a commercial driver's license shall receive a limited
89 driving privilege issued for the purpose of operating a commercial motor vehicle if such
90 person's driving privilege is suspended, revoked, cancelled, denied, or disqualified. Nothing
91 in this section shall prohibit the issuance of a limited driving privilege for the purpose of
HB 1794 4
92 operating a noncommercial motor vehicle provided that pursuant to the provisions of this
93 section, the applicant is not otherwise ineligible for a limited driving privilege.
94 (8) (a) Provided that pursuant to the provisions of this section, the applicant is not

107 otherwise ineligible for a limited driving privilege or convicted of acting with criminal
108 negligence while driving while intoxicated to cause the death of another person, a circuit
109 court or the director may, in the manner prescribed in this subsection, allow a person who has
110 had such person's license to operate a motor vehicle revoked where that person cannot obtain
111 a new license for a period of five years because of two convictions of driving while
112 intoxicated, as prescribed in subdivision (10) of subsection 1 of section 302.060, to apply for
113 a limited driving privilege pursuant to this subsection. Such person shall present evidence
114 satisfactory to the court or the director that such person's habits and conduct show that the
115 person no longer poses a threat to the public safety of this state. Any person who is denied a

122 the alcohol-related enforcement contact that resulted in the person's license denial.
123 (9) A DWI docket or court established under section 478.007 may grant a limited
124 driving privilege to a participant in or graduate of the program who would otherwise be
125 ineligible for such privilege under another provision of law.

134 out the provisions of this section. Any rule or portion of a rule, as that term is defined in
135 section 536.010, that is created under the authority delegated in this section shall become
136 effective only if it complies with and is subject to all of the provisions of chapter 536 and, if
137 applicable, section 536.028. This section and chapter 536 are nonseverable and if any of the
138 powers vested with the general assembly pursuant to chapter 536 to review, to delay the
139 effective date or to disapprove and annul a rule are subsequently held unconstitutional, then
140 the grant of rulemaking authority and any rule proposed or adopted after August 28, 2001,
