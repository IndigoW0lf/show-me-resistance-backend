Be it enacted by the General Assembly of the State of Missouri, as follows:
1 Section A. Chapter 171, RSMo, is amended by adding thereto
2 one new section, to be known as section 171.425, to read as

5 and indicated on their birth certificate;
6 (2) "Minor", any person less than eighteen years of
7 age;
8 (3) "Public school", the same as defined in section
9 160.011.
10 2. In every public school setting in which a minor may
11 be in a state of undress in the presence of other people,
12 school personnel shall provide separate, distinct areas
13 designated for use by minors based on their biological sex
14 to ensure the personal privacy and safety of minors.
15 3. Every public school shower room, locker room, and
16 restroom designated for use by minors and which is
17 accessible by multiple individuals at the same time shall be
18 designated for and used only by minors of the same

22 4. (1) A minor who asserts to school officials that
23 his or her gender is different from his or her biological
24 sex may be provided with alternative shower room, locker
25 room, or restroom accommodations, provided that a parent or
26 legal guardian of a minor who makes such assertion shall
27 provide written consent to use of such alternative
28 accommodations. Such accommodations shall not include the
29 use of shower rooms, locker rooms, or restrooms designated
30 for use by minors of the opposite biological sex.

35 5. A school district that violates any provision of
36 this section shall not be entitled to receive any state aid
37 under chapter 163 and shall be classified as unaccredited
38 until the district proves to the satisfaction of the
39 department of elementary and secondary education that the
40 district is no longer in violation of this section.
