AN ACT
To repeal sections 72.418 and 321.300, RSMo, and to enact in lieu thereof two new sections
relating to fire protection districts.
Be it enacted by the General Assembly of the State of Missouri, as follows:
1 Section A. Sections 72.418 and 321.300, RSMo, are repealed
2 and two new sections enacted in lieu thereof, to be known as
3 sections 72.418 and 321.300, to read as follows:
1 72.418. 1. Notwithstanding any other provision of law
2 to the contrary, no new city created pursuant to sections
3 72.400 to 72.423 shall establish a municipal fire department
4 to provide fire protection services, including emergency
5 medical services, if such city formerly consisted of
6 unincorporated areas in the county or municipalities in the
7 county, or both, which are provided fire protection services
8 and emergency medical services by one or more fire
9 protection districts. Such fire protection districts shall
10 continue to provide services to the area comprising the new
11 city and may levy and collect taxes the same as such
12 districts had prior to the creation of such new city.
13 2. Fire protection districts serving the area included
14 within any annexation by a city having a fire department,
15 including simplified boundary changes, shall continue to
16 provide fire protection services, including emergency
17 medical services to such area. The annexing city shall pay
18 annually to the fire protection district an amount equal to
EXPLANATION-Matter enclosed in bold-faced brackets [thus] in this bill is not enacted
and is intended to be omitted in the law.
SB 764 2
19 that which the fire protection district would have levied on
20 all taxable property within the annexed area. Such annexed
21 area shall not be subject to taxation for any purpose
22 thereafter by the fire protection district except for bonded
23 indebtedness by the fire protection district which existed
24 prior to the annexation. The amount to be paid annually by
25 the municipality to the fire protection district pursuant
26 hereto shall be a sum equal to the annual assessed value
27 multiplied by the annual tax rate as certified by the fire
28 protection district to the municipality, including any
29 portion of the tax created for emergency medical service
30 provided by the district, per one hundred dollars of
31 assessed value in such area. The tax rate so computed shall
32 include any tax on bonded indebtedness incurred subsequent
33 to such annexation, but shall not include any portion of the
34 tax rate for bonded indebtedness incurred prior to such
35 annexation. Notwithstanding any other provision of law to
36 the contrary, the residents of an area annexed on or after
37 May 26, 1994, may vote in all fire protection district
38 elections and may be elected to the fire protection district
39 board of directors.
40 3. The fire protection district may approve or reject
41 any proposal for the provision of fire protection and
42 emergency medical services by a city.
43 4. Notwithstanding any other provision of law to the
44 contrary, no city shall have any obligation to make any
45 payments for the provision of fire protection services for
46 any territory or tract of land included in a fire protection
47 district pursuant to subsection 3 of section 321.300.
48 5. No corporation, organization, or other entity that
49 is annexed into a fire protection district that has its own
50 fire department providing fire protection services,
SB 764 3
51 including emergency medical services, shall be subject to
52 taxes for fire protection services levied by a fire
53 protection district serving the area where the corporation,
54 organization, or entity is located.
55 6. Notwithstanding any other provision of law to the
56 contrary, if any city which has annexed fire protection
57 service areas pursuant to this section no longer maintains a
58 municipal fire department the following shall occur without
59 delay:
60 (1) For the purpose of the provision of fire
61 protection services, any annexed service area shall revert
62 back to the district boundaries of the fire protection
63 district that provided services prior to such annexation;
64 (2) For the purpose of the provision of emergency
65 medical services, any annexed service area shall revert back
66 to the district boundaries of the fire protection district
67 that provided services prior to such annexation; and
68 (3) All property reverting back to a fire protection
69 district shall thereafter be subject to taxation by the fire
70 protection district and the city which no longer maintains a
71 municipal fire department shall no longer make any payments
72 to a fire protection district for fire protection or
73 emergency medical services.
1 321.300. 1. The boundaries of any district organized
2 pursuant to the provisions of this chapter may be changed in
3 the manner prescribed in this section; but any change of
4 boundaries of the district shall not impair or affect its
5 organization or its rights in or to property, or any of its
6 rights or privileges whatsoever; nor shall it affect or
7 impair or discharge any contract, obligation, lien or charge
8 for or upon which it might be liable or chargeable had any
9 change of boundaries not been made.
SB 764 4
10 2. The boundaries may be changed as follows:
11 (1) Twenty-five percent of the number of voters who
12 voted in the most recent gubernatorial election in the area
13 to be annexed may file with the board a petition in writing
14 praying that such real property be included within the
15 district; provided that in the case of a municipality having
16 less than twenty percent of its total population in one fire
17 protection district, the entire remaining portion may be
18 included in another district so that none of the city is
19 outside of a fire protection district at the time. The
20 petition shall describe the property to be included in the
21 district and shall describe the property owned by the
22 petitioners and shall be deemed to give assent of the
23 petitioners to the inclusion in the district of the property
24 described in the petition; and such petition shall be in
25 substantially the form set forth in section 321.495 dealing
26 with referendums and verified in like manner; provided,
27 however, that in the event that there are more than twenty-
28 five property owners or taxpaying electors signing the
29 petition, it shall be deemed sufficient description of their
30 property in the petition as required in this section to list
31 the addresses of such property; or
32 (2) All of the owners of any territory or tract of
33 land near or adjacent to a fire protection district who own
34 all of the real estate in such territory or tract of land
35 may file a petition with the board praying that such real
36 property be included in the district. The petition shall
37 describe the property owned by the petitioners and shall be
38 deemed to give assent of the petitioners to the inclusion in
39 the district of the property described in the petition;
40 (3) Notwithstanding any provision of law to the
41 contrary, in any fire protection district which is partly or
SB 764 5
42 wholly located in a noncharter county of the first
43 classification with a population of less than one hundred
44 thousand which adjoins any county of the first
45 classification with a charter form of government with a
46 population of nine hundred thousand or more inhabitants, if
47 such fire protection district serves any portion of a city
48 which is located in both such counties, the boundaries of
49 the district may be expanded so as to include the entire
50 city within the fire protection district, but the boundaries
51 of the district shall not be expanded beyond the city limits
52 of such city, as the boundaries of such city existed on
53 January 1, 1993. Such change in the boundaries of the
54 district shall be accomplished only if twenty-five percent
55 of the number of voters who voted in the most recent
56 gubernatorial election in the area to be annexed file with
57 the board a petition in writing praying that such real
58 property be included within the district. The petition
59 shall describe the property to be included in the district
60 and shall describe the property owned by the petitioners and
61 shall be deemed to give assent of the petitioners to the
62 inclusion in the district of the property described in the
63 petition; and such petition shall be in substantially the
64 form set forth in section 321.495 dealing with referendums
65 and verified in like manner.
66 3. Notwithstanding any other provision of chapter 321
67 to the contrary, in any county with a charter form of
68 government where fifty or more cities, towns, and villages
69 have been established, any territory or tract of land in a
70 city with a population greater than twenty-four thousand
71 inhabitants but less than twenty-eight thousand inhabitants,
72 which territory or tract of land was previously excluded
73 from a fire protection district following a municipal
SB 764 6
74 annexation and which receives fire protection and emergency
75 medical services from that fire protection district, may be
76 also included in that fire protection district as follows:
77 (1) Any owner of property within a territory or tract
78 of land proposed to be included in the fire protection
79 district serving that territory or tract of land may file a
80 petition with the board of directors of the fire protection
81 district. If the county election authority determines there
82 were no registered voters residing within the territory or
83 tract of land as of the date of the earliest signature on
84 the petition, no election as provided in section 321.301
85 shall be held with regard to inclusion of such a territory
86 or tract of land;
87 (2) If the petition does not include the signatures of
88 all property owners within the territory or tract of land,
89 the board of directors of the fire protection district shall
90 schedule a public hearing and provide notice of the filing
91 of the petition as provided in subsection 4 of this section,
92 at which the board shall determine whether to grant the
93 petition or part thereof, as provided in subsection 5 of
94 this section;
95 (3) If the board grants the petition, in whole or in
96 part, any person aggrieved by the decision of the board may
97 appeal the decision as provided in subsection 6 of this
98 section.
99 4. The secretary of the board shall cause notice of
100 the filing of any petition filed pursuant to this section to
101 be given and published in the county in which the property
102 is located, which notice shall recite the filing of such
103 petition, the number of petitioners, a general description
104 of the boundaries of the area proposed to be included and
105 the prayer of the petitioners; giving notice to all persons
SB 764 7
106 interested to appear at the office of the board at the time
107 named in the notice and show cause in writing, if any they
108 have, why the petition should not be granted. The board
109 shall at the time and place mentioned, or at such time or
110 times to which the hearing may be adjourned, proceed to hear
111 the petition and all objections thereto presented in writing
112 by any person showing cause why the petition should not be
113 granted. The failure of any person interested to show cause
114 in writing why such petition shall not be granted shall be
115 deemed as an assent on his part to the inclusion of such
116 lands in the district as prayed for in the petition.
117 [4.] 5. If the board deems it for the best interest of
118 the district, it shall grant the petition, but if the board
119 determines that some portion of the property mentioned in
120 the petition cannot as a practical matter be served by the
121 district, or if it deems it for the best interest of the
122 district that some portion of the property in the petition
123 not be included in the district, then the board shall grant
124 the petition in part only. If the petition is granted, the
125 board shall make an order to that effect and file the same
126 with the circuit clerk; and upon the order of the court
127 having jurisdiction over the district, the property shall be
128 included in the district. If the petition contains the
129 signatures of all the owners of the property pursuant to the
130 provisions of subdivision (2) of subsection 2 of this
131 section, the property shall be included in the district upon
132 the order of the court. If the petition contains the
133 signatures of twenty-five percent of the number of voters
134 who voted in the most recent gubernatorial election in the
135 area to be annexed pursuant to subdivision (1) or
136 subdivision (3) of subsection 2 of this section, the
137 property shall be included in the district subject to the
SB 764 8
138 election provided in section 321.301. The circuit court
139 having jurisdiction over the district shall proceed to make
140 any such order including such additional property within the
141 district as is provided in the order of the board, unless
142 the court shall find that such order of the board was not
143 authorized by law or that such order of the board was not
144 supported by competent and substantial evidence.
145 [5.] 6. Any person aggrieved by any decision of the
146 board made pursuant to the provisions of this section may
147 appeal that decision to the circuit court of the county in
148 which the property is located within thirty days of the
149 decision by the board.
150 [6.] 7. No fire protection district, or employee
151 thereof, in which territory is annexed pursuant to this
152 section shall be required to comply with any prescribed
153 firefighter training program or regimen which would not
154 otherwise apply to the district or its employees, but for
155 the requirements applicable to the annexed territory.
