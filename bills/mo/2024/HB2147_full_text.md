4 which students in the public schools of the state are proficient in the knowledge, skills, and
5 competencies adopted by such board pursuant to section 160.514. The statewide assessment
6 system shall assess problem solving, analytical ability, evaluation, creativity, and application

29 subsection 1 of this section, or until said statewide assessment system is available, by
30 indicators approved for such use by the state board of education. The provisions of other law

103 assessments but shall, if necessary, develop alternate assessments and recommend one or
104 morealternate assessments for adoption by thestate board. Thestate board shall considerthe
105 recommendations of the advisory council in establishing such alternate assessment or
106 assessments. Any student who receives special educational services, as that term is defined
107 pursuant tosection 162.675, shall beassessed byan alternate assessment establishedpursuant
108 to this subsection upon a determination by the student's individualized education program
109 team that such alternate assessment is more appropriate to assess the student's knowledge,

111 section. The alternate assessment shall evaluate the student's independent living skills, which
112 includehow effectivelythestudent addressescommonlifedemandsand howwellthe student
113 meets standards for personal independence expected for someone in the student's age group,
