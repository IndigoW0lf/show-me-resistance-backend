4 which students in the public schools of the state are proficient in the knowledge, skills, and
5 competencies adopted by such board pursuant to section 160.514. The statewide assessment
6 system shall assess problem solving, analytical ability, evaluation, creativity, and application

27 levels worthy of imitation by students in other schools in the state and nation. Exemplary
28 levels shall be measured by the statewide assessment system developed pursuant to
29 subsection 1 of this section, or until said statewide assessment system is available, by
30 indicators approved for such use by the state board of education. The provisions of other law
31 to the contrary notwithstanding, the commissioner of education may, upon request of the

85 appropriately and effectively assessing the academic achievement of students.
86 5. (1) To the extent and as required by federal law, the state board of education
87 shall create a single statewide accountability system for all public schools and charter

102 advisory panel shall attempt to identify preexisting developmentally appropriate alternate
103 assessments but shall, if necessary, develop alternate assessments and recommend one or
104 morealternate assessments for adoption by thestate board. Thestate board shall considerthe
105 recommendations of the advisory council in establishing such alternate assessment or
106 assessments. Any student who receives special educational services, as that term is defined
107 pursuant tosection 162.675, shall beassessed byan alternate assessment establishedpursuant
108 to this subsection upon a determination by the student's individualized education program
109 team that such alternate assessment is more appropriate to assess the student's knowledge,
110 skills and competencies than the assessment developed pursuant to subsection 1 of this
111 section. The alternate assessment shall evaluate the student's independent living skills, which
112 includehow effectivelythestudent addressescommonlifedemandsand howwellthe student
113 meets standards for personal independence expected for someone in the student's age group,
