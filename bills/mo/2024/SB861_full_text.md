159 days after receipt of service. Unless otherwise agreed upon

168 for each of the [offenses, violations, or infractions]
169 crimes listed in the petition for expungement:
170 (1) At the time the petition is filed, it has been at
171 least three years if the offense is a felony, or at least
172 one year if the offense is a misdemeanor, municipal
173 [offense] violation, or infraction, from the date the
174 petitioner completed any authorized disposition imposed
175 under section 557.011 for each [offense, violation, or
176 infraction] crime listed in the petition;
177 (2) At the time the petition is filed, it has been at
178 least ten years from the date on which the authorized
179 dispositions imposed under section 557.011 for all crimes
180 committed within the relevant period have been completed if
181 the crimes sought to be expunged were committed as part of
182 the same course of criminal conduct or as part of an
SB 861 9
183 extended course of criminal conduct under subdivisions (1)
184 and (2) of subsection 2 of this section;
185 (3) At the time the petition is filed, the person has
186 not been found guilty of any other misdemeanor or felony,
187 not including violations of the traffic regulations provided
188 under chapters 301, 302, 303, 304, and 307, during the time
189 period specified for the underlying [offense, violation, or
190 infraction] crime in subdivision (1) of this subsection or
191 it has been at least three years if the offense is a felony,
192 or at least one year if the offense is a misdemeanor,
193 municipal violation, or infraction, from the date the
194 petitioner completed any authorized disposition imposed
195 under section 557.011 for each crime listed in the petition;
196 [(3)] (4) The person has satisfied all obligations
197 relating to any such disposition, including the payment of
198 any fines or restitution;
199 [(4)] (5) The person does not have charges pending;
200 [(5)] (6) The petitioner's habits and conduct
201 demonstrate that the petitioner is not a threat to the
202 public safety of the state; and
203 [(6)] (7) The expungement is consistent with the
204 public welfare and the interests of justice warrant the
205 expungement.
206 A pleading by the petitioner that such petitioner meets the
207 requirements of subdivisions [(5)] (6) and [(6)] (7) of this
208 subsection shall create a rebuttable presumption that the
209 expungement is warranted so long as the criteria contained
210 in subdivisions (1) to [(4)] (5) of this subsection are
211 otherwise satisfied. The burden shall shift to the
212 prosecuting attorney[,] or circuit attorney[, or municipal
213 prosecuting attorney] to rebut the presumption. A victim of
SB 861 10
214 [an offense, violation, or infraction] a crime listed in the
215 petition shall have an opportunity to be heard at any
216 hearing held under this section[, and the court may make a
217 determination based solely on such victim's testimony]. A
218 court may find that the continuing impact of the offense
219 upon the victim rebuts the presumption that expungement is
220 warranted.
221 [6.] 7. A petition to expunge records related to an
222 arrest for an eligible [offense, violation, or infraction]
223 crime may be made in accordance with the provisions of this
224 section to a court of competent jurisdiction in the county
225 where the petitioner was arrested no earlier than [three
226 years] eighteen months from the date of arrest; provided
227 that, during such time, the petitioner has not been charged
228 and the petitioner has not been found guilty of any
229 misdemeanor or felony offense.
230 [7.] 8. If the court determines that such person meets
231 all the criteria set forth in subsection [5] 6 of this
232 section for each of the [offenses, violations, or
233 infractions] crimes listed in the petition for expungement,
234 the court shall enter an order of expungement. In all cases
235 under this section, the court shall issue an order of
236 expungement or dismissal within six months of the filing of
237 the petition. A copy of the order of expungement shall be
238 provided to the petitioner and each entity possessing
239 records subject to the order, and, upon receipt of the
240 order, each entity shall close any record in its possession
241 relating to any [offense, violation, or infraction] crime
242 listed in the petition, in the manner established by section
243 610.120. The records and files maintained in any
244 administrative or court proceeding in a municipal,
245 associate, or circuit court for any [offense, infraction, or
SB 861 11
246 violation] crime ordered expunged under this section shall
247 be confidential and only available to the parties or by
248 order of the court for good cause shown. The central
249 repository shall request the Federal Bureau of Investigation
250 to expunge the records from its files.
251 [8.] 9. The order shall not limit any of the
252 petitioner's rights that were restricted as a collateral
253 consequence of such person's criminal record, and such
254 rights shall be restored upon issuance of the order of
255 expungement. Except as otherwise provided under this
256 section, the effect of such order shall be to fully restore
257 the civil rights of such person to the status he or she
258 occupied prior to such arrests, pleas, trials, or
259 convictions as if such events had never taken place. This
260 includes fully restoring the civil rights of a person to the
261 right to vote, the right to hold public office, and to serve
262 as a juror. For purposes of 18 U.S.C. Section
263 921(a)(33)(B)(ii), an order [or] of expungement granted
264 pursuant to this section shall be considered a complete
265 removal of all effects of the expunged conviction. Except
266 as otherwise provided under this section, the effect of such
267 order shall be to restore such person to the status he or
268 she occupied prior to such arrests, pleas, trials, or
269 convictions as if such events had never taken place. No
270 person as to whom such order has been entered shall be held
271 thereafter under any provision of law to be guilty of
272 perjury or otherwise giving a false statement by reason of
273 his or her failure to recite or acknowledge such arrests,
274 pleas, trials, convictions, or expungement in response to an
275 inquiry made of him or her and no such inquiry shall be made
276 for information relating to an expungement, except the
277 petitioner shall disclose the expunged [offense, violation,
SB 861 12
278 or infraction] crime to any court when asked or upon being
279 charged with any subsequent [offense, violation, or
280 infraction] crime. The expunged [offense, violation, or
281 infraction] crime may be considered a prior offense in
282 determining a sentence to be imposed for any subsequent
283 offense that the person is found guilty of committing.
284 [9.] 10. Notwithstanding the provisions of subsection
285 [8] 9 of this section to the contrary, a person granted an
286 expungement shall disclose any expunged [offense, violation,
287 or infraction] crime when the disclosure of such information
288 is necessary to complete any application for:
289 (1) A license, certificate, or permit issued by this
290 state to practice such individual's profession;
291 (2) Any license issued under chapter 313 or permit
292 issued under chapter 571;
293 (3) Paid or unpaid employment with an entity licensed
294 under chapter 313, any state-operated lottery, or any
295 emergency services provider, including any law enforcement
296 agency;
297 (4) Employment with any federally insured bank or
298 savings institution or credit union or an affiliate of such
299 institution or credit union for the purposes of compliance
300 with 12 U.S.C. Section 1829 and 12 U.S.C. Section 1785;
301 (5) Employment with any entity engaged in the business
302 of insurance or any insurer for the purpose of complying
303 with 18 U.S.C. Section 1033, 18 U.S.C. Section 1034, or
304 other similar law which requires an employer engaged in the
305 business of insurance to exclude applicants with certain
306 criminal convictions from employment; or
307 (6) Employment with any employer that is required to
308 exclude applicants with certain criminal convictions from
SB 861 13
309 employment due to federal or state law, including
310 corresponding rules and regulations.
311 An employer shall notify an applicant of the requirements
312 under subdivisions (4) to (6) of this subsection.
313 Notwithstanding any provision of law to the contrary, an
314 expunged [offense, violation, or infraction] crime shall not
315 be grounds for automatic disqualification of an applicant,
316 but may be a factor for denying employment, or a
317 professional license, certificate, or permit; except that,
318 [an offense, violation, or infraction] a crime expunged
319 under the provisions of this section may be grounds for
320 automatic disqualification if the application is for
321 employment under subdivisions (4) to (6) of this subsection.
322 [10.] 11. A person who has been granted an expungement
323 of records pertaining to a [misdemeanor or felony offense,
324 an ordinance violation, or an infraction] crime may answer
325 "no" to an employer's inquiry into whether the person has
326 ever been arrested, charged, or convicted of a crime if,
327 after the granting of the expungement, the person has no
328 public record of a [misdemeanor or felony offense, an
329 ordinance violation, or an infraction] crime. The person,
330 however, shall answer such an inquiry affirmatively and
331 disclose his or her criminal convictions, including any
332 offense [or violation] expunged under this section or
333 similar law, if the employer is required to exclude
334 applicants with certain criminal convictions from employment
335 due to federal or state law, including corresponding rules
336 and regulations.
337 [11.] 12. If the court determines that the petitioner
338 has not met the criteria for any of the [offenses,
339 violations, or infractions] crimes listed in the petition
SB 861 14
340 for expungement or the petitioner has knowingly provided
341 false information in the petition, the court shall enter an
342 order dismissing the petition. Any person whose petition
343 for expungement has been dismissed by the court for failure
344 to meet the criteria set forth in subsection [5] 6 of this
345 section may not refile another petition until a year has
346 passed since the date of filing for the previous petition.
347 [12.] 13. A person may be granted more than one
348 expungement under this section provided that during his or
349 her lifetime, the total number of [offenses, violations, or
350 infractions] crimes for which orders of expungement are
351 granted to the person shall not exceed the following limits:
352 (1) Not more than [two] three misdemeanor offenses or
353 ordinance violations that have an authorized term of
354 imprisonment; and
355 (2) Not more than [one] two felony [offense] offenses.
356 A person may be granted expungement under this section for
357 any number of infractions. [Nothing in this section shall
358 prevent the court from maintaining records to ensure that an
359 individual has not exceeded the limitations of this
360 subsection] A person may not be granted an expungement both
361 under subdivisions (1) and (2) of subsection 2 of this
362 section. Nothing in this section shall be construed to
363 limit or impair in any way the subsequent use of any record
364 expunged under this section of any arrests or findings of
365 guilt by a law enforcement agency, criminal justice agency,
366 prosecuting attorney[,] or circuit attorney[, or municipal
367 prosecuting attorney,] including its use as a prior
368 [offense, violation, or infraction] crime.
369 [13.] 14. The court shall make available a form for
370 pro se petitioners seeking expungement, which shall include
SB 861 15
371 the following statement: "I declare under penalty of
372 perjury that the statements made herein are true and correct
