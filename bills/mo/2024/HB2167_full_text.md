13 including, but not limited to, the bulk power system or other critical facilities and
14 cybersecurity measures. These protections may include the requirement that parties

21 to determine whether protection from disclosure is warranted:
22 (1) Whether disclosure will significantly aid the commission in fulfilling its
23 functions;
24 (2) The harm or benefit which disclosure will cause to the public interest;
25 (3) The harm which disclosure will cause to the public entity; and
26 (4) Any alternative to disclosure that will serve the public interest and protect
27 the public utility.

29 under review. In case the order or decision is reversed by reason of the commission failing to
30 receive testimony properly proffered, the court shall remand the cause to the commission,
31 with instructions to receive the testimony so proffered and rejected, and enter a new order or
32 render a new decision based upon the evidence theretofore taken, and such as it is directed to
33 receive. The court may, in its discretion, remand any cause which is reversed by it to the
34 commissionfor further action. No court in this state, except the supremecourt orthe court of
35 appeals, shall have jurisdiction or authority to review, reverse, correct or annul any order or

16 agreement, rule, regulation or practice would otherwise go into effect; and after full hearing,
17 whether completed before or after the rate, charge, form of contract or agreement, rule,
18 regulation or practice goes into effect, the commission may make such order in reference to

29 speedily as possible.
30 3. (1) The test year for proceedings under this section shall be a future year
31 utilizing a twelve-month period ending no later than twenty four months after the filing
32 of schedules stating new base rates. New base rates shall not go into effect before the

34 for the future test year, the commission shall utilize a thirteen-month average projected
35 rate base, a thirteen-month average of the public utility’s projected capital structure, a
36 thirteen-month average of the public utility’s projectedcost of debt, projected revenues,

48 period selected by the electrical corporation shall be used to set base rates in
49 proceedings under this section.
50 (3) With respect to public utilities that are not also an electrical corporation,
51 within sixty days of the end of the future test year such public utility shall update its
52 base rates that were approved by the commission in its report and order issued in the
53 proceeding under this section to reflect the total rate base at the end of the future test
54 year.
55 (4) The test year selected by the public utility shall be used for setting base rates
56 in proceedings under this section. The public counsel, the staff of the commission, and
57 intervenors in the case may propose adjustments or other changes to the revenue
58 requirement of the test year selected by the public utility but shall not present
59 alternative base rates based on a test year different from that selected by the utility.
