119 until such time that the district is classified by the state
120 board of education as provisionally accredited for at least
121 two successive academic years, after which time the state
122 board of education [may] shall provide for a transition
123 pursuant to section 162.083; or

131 a. [A rationale for the decision to use an alternative
132 form of governance and] In the absence of the district's
133 achievement of provisional or full accreditation, the state

151 effectiveness of the [alternative governance] special
152 administrative board; or
153 (c) Attach the territory of the [lapsed] unaccredited
154 district to another district or districts for school
155 purposes[; or
156 (d) Establish one or more school districts within the

158 structure specified by the state board of education, with
159 the option of permitting a district to remain intact for the
160 purposes of assessing, collecting, and distributing property
161 taxes, to be distributed equitably on a weighted average
162 daily attendance basis, but to be divided for operational
163 purposes, which shall take effect sixty days after the
164 adjournment of the regular session of the general assembly
165 next following the state board's decision unless a statute
166 or concurrent resolution is enacted to nullify the state
167 board's decision prior to such effective date].
168 4. If a district remains under continued governance by
169 the elected school board under subdivision (1) of subsection
170 3 of this section and either has been unaccredited for three
171 consecutive school years and failed to attain accredited
172 status after the third school year or has been unaccredited
173 for two consecutive school years and the state board of
174 education determines its academic progress is not consistent
175 with attaining accredited status after the third school
176 year, then the state board of education shall proceed under
SB 1104 7
177 subdivision (2) of subsection 3 of this section in the
178 following school year.

189 school building in the district that is operated under a
190 contract with an accredited school district as specified

192 diploma from the accredited school district. The authority
193 of the special administrative board [or any other form of
194 governance] appointed under this section shall expire at the
195 end of the third full school year following its appointment,
196 unless extended for not more than three full school years by
197 the state board of education. No additional extensions
198 shall be granted. Governance of the school district shall
199 be returned to the elected board upon the expiration of the
200 authority of the special administrative board. If the
201 [lapsed] district is reassigned, the governing board prior

203 funds, assets and liabilities of the [lapsed] reassigned
204 district and transfer such funds, assets, and liabilities of
205 the [lapsed] reassigned district as determined by the state
206 board of education. Neither the special administrative
207 board nor any other form of governance [appointed under this
208 section] nor its members or employees shall be deemed to be
SB 1104 8
209 the state or a state agency for any purpose, including
210 section 105.711, et seq. The state of Missouri, its

213 in any way involving the [lapsed] unaccredited district, a
214 special administrative board, any other form of governance

243 any part of such [lapsed] school district attached without

245 9. If the state board of education reasonably believes
246 that a school district is unlikely to provide for the
247 minimum school term required by section 163.021 because of
248 financial difficulty, the state board of education may,
249 prior to the start of the school term:
250 (1) Allow continued governance by the existing
251 district school board under terms and conditions established
252 by the state board of education; or

19 special administrative board from standing for an elected
20 term on the board, upon the dissolution of the special
21 administrative board or upon his or her resignation from the
22 special administrative board.
23 [4.] 2. Not later than six full school years following
