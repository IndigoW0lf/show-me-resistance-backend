WHEREAS, hypertrophic cardiomyopathy ("HCM") is a chronic cardiac disease
2 involving thickening of the heart muscle and can potentially lead to debilitating symptoms
3 and serious complications, including heart failure, atrial fibrillation, stroke, and, in rare cases,
4 sudden cardiac death; and
5
6 WHEREAS, HCM is the most common inheritable heart disease and can affect
7 anyone regardless of age, gender, or ethnicity, with a reported prevalence ranging from 1 in
8 200 to 1 in 500 in the general population; and
9
10 WHEREAS, an estimated 700,000 to 1,650,000 people in the United States have
11 HCM, yet eighty-five percent of them may remain undiagnosed; and
12
13 WHEREAS, HCM shares symptoms with other common cardiovascular and
14 pulmonary diseases, such as shortness of breath, chest pain, fatigue, palpitations, and
15 fainting, making it difficult to distinguish HCM from these other diseases; and
16
17 WHEREAS, when untreated, all-cause mortality risk is three to four times higher in
18 patients with HCM than that of the general population; and
19
20 WHEREAS, knowing one's medical history and any signs and symptoms of HCM is
21 an important first step in receiving an accurate diagnosis of HCM; and
22
23 WHEREAS, a health care provider must conduct a thorough screening with cardiac
24 health questions to help identify a risk of both genetic and congenital cardiac disorders; and
25
HCR 31 2
26 WHEREAS, a health care provider may conduct several tests, including an
27 echocardiogram, a cardiac MRI, or genetic testing, to confirm a family history of HCM
28 and must examine the heart to diagnose HCM; and
29
30 WHEREAS, following a diagnosis of HCM, it is important for patients to work with
31 their health care providers to learn more about their disease and understand different
32 management options, including prescription medicines and surgical treatment options that
33 may help:
34

36 Representatives of the One Hundred Second General Assembly, Second Regular Session, the
37 Senate concurring therein, hereby:

44 care for hypertrophic cardiomyopathy as a serious public health issue.
