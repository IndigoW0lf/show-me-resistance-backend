19 2. For all tax years beginning on or after January 1,
20 2021, a taxpayer shall be allowed a deduction of one hundred
21 percent of a participating taxpayer's contributions to a
22 long-term dignity savings account in the tax year of the
23 contribution. Each taxpayer claiming the deduction under
24 this section shall file an affidavit with the income tax
25 return verifying the amount of their contributions. The
26 amount of the deduction claimed shall not exceed the amount
27 of the taxpayer's Missouri adjusted gross income for the tax
28 year that the deduction is claimed, and shall not exceed
29 four thousand dollars per taxpayer claiming the deduction,
30 or eight thousand dollars if married filing combined.
31 3. Income earned or received as a result of assets in
32 a long-term dignity savings account shall not be subject to
33 state income tax imposed under this chapter. The exemption
34 under this section shall apply only to income maintained,
35 accrued, or expended pursuant to the requirements of
36 sections 191.1601 to 191.1607, and no exemption shall apply
37 to assets and income expended for any other purpose. The
38 amount of the deduction claimed shall not exceed the amount
39 of the taxpayer's Missouri adjusted gross income for the tax
40 year the deduction is claimed.
41 4. If any deductible contributions to or earnings from
42 any such programs referred to in this section are
43 distributed and not used to pay for eligible expenses or are
44 not held for the minimum length of time under subsection 2
45 of section 191.1605, the amount so distributed shall be
46 added to the Missouri adjusted gross income of the account
47 holder or, if the account holder is not living, the
48 qualified beneficiary, in the year of distribution.
49 5. The department of revenue shall promulgate rules to
50 implement the provisions of this section. Any rule or
SB 1010 3
51 portion of a rule, as that term is defined in section
52 536.010, that is created under the authority delegated in
53 this section shall become effective only if it complies with
54 and is subject to all of the provisions of chapter 536 and,
55 if applicable, section 536.028. This section and chapter
56 536 are nonseverable and if any of the powers vested with
57 the general assembly pursuant to chapter 536 to review, to
58 delay the effective date, or to disapprove and annul a rule
59 are subsequently held unconstitutional, then the grant of
60 rulemaking authority and any rule proposed or adopted after
61 August 28, 2020, shall be invalid and void.
62 6. Under section 23.253 of the Missouri sunset act:
63 (1) The provisions of the [new] program authorized
64 under this section shall automatically sunset on December
65 [thirty-first four years after August 28, 2020] 31, 2029,
66 unless reauthorized by an act of the general assembly;
67 (2) If such program is reauthorized, the program
68 authorized under this section shall automatically sunset on
69 December thirty-first four years after the effective date of
70 the reauthorization of this section; and
