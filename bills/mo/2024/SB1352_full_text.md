1 400.1-301. (a) Except as otherwise provided in this
2 section, when a transaction bears a reasonable relation to
3 this state and also to another state or nation the parties
4 may agree that the law either of this state or of such other
5 state or nation shall govern their rights and duties.
SB 1352 12
6 (b) In the absence of an agreement effective under
7 subsection (a), and except as provided in subsection (c),
8 this chapter applies to transactions bearing an appropriate
9 relation to this state.
10 (c) If one of the following provisions of this chapter
11 specifies the applicable law, that provision governs and a
12 contrary agreement is effective only to the extent permitted
13 by the law so specified:
14 (1) section 400.2-402;
15 (2) sections 400.2A-105 and 400.2A-106;
16 (3) section 400.4-102;
17 (4) section 400.4A-507;
18 (5) section 400.5-116;
19 (6) section 400.8-110;
20 (7) sections 400.9-301 through 400.9-307;
21 (8) section 400.12-107.
1 400.1-306. A claim or right arising out of an alleged
2 breach may be discharged in whole or in part without
3 consideration by agreement of the aggrieved party in [an
4 authenticated] a signed record.
1 400.2-102. (1) Unless the context otherwise requires,
2 [this article applies to transactions in goods; it does not
3 apply to any transaction which although in the form of an
4 unconditional contract to sell or present sale is intended
5 to operate only as a security transaction nor does this
6 article impair or repeal any statute regulating sales to
7 consumers, farmers or other specified classes of buyers] and
8 except as provided in subsection (3), this Article applies
9 to transactions in goods and, in the case of a hybrid
10 transaction, it applies to the extent provided in subsection
11 (2).
12 (2) In a hybrid transaction:
SB 1352 13
13 (a) If the sale-of-goods aspects do not predominate,
14 only the provisions of this Article which relate primarily
15 to the sale-of-goods aspects of the transaction apply, and
16 the provisions that relate primarily to the transaction as a
17 whole do not apply.
18 (b) If the sale-of-goods aspects predominate, this
19 Article applies to the transaction but does not preclude
20 application in appropriate circumstances of other law to
21 aspects of the transaction which do not relate to the sale
22 of goods.
23 (3) This Article does not:
24 (a) Apply to a transaction that, even though in the
25 form of an unconditional contract to sell or present sale,
26 operates only to create a security interest; or
27 (b) Impair or repeal a statute regulating sales to
28 consumers, farmers, or other specified classes of buyers.
1 400.2-106. (1) In this article unless the context
2 otherwise requires "contract" and "agreement" are limited to
3 those relating to the present or future sale of goods.
4 "Contract for sale" includes both a present sale of goods
5 and a contract to sell goods at a future time. A "sale"
6 consists in the passing of title from the seller to the
7 buyer for a price (section 400.2-401). A "present" means a
8 sale which is accomplished by the making of the contract.
9 (2) Goods or conduct including any part of a
10 performance are "conforming" or conform to the contract when
11 they are in accordance with the obligations under the
12 contract.
13 (3) "Termination" occurs when either party pursuant to
14 a power created by agreement or law puts an end to the
15 contract otherwise than for its breach. On "termination"
16 all obligations which are still executory on both sides are
SB 1352 14
17 discharged but any right based on prior breach or
18 performance survives.
19 (4) "Cancellation" occurs when either party puts an
20 end to the contract for breach by the other and its effect
21 is the same as that of "termination" except that the
22 cancelling party also retains any remedy for breach of the
23 whole contract or any unperformed balance.
24 (5) "Hybrid transaction" means a single transaction
25 involving a sale of goods and:
26 (a) the provision of services;
27 (b) a lease of other goods; or
28 (c) a sale, lease, or license of property other than
29 goods.
1 400.2-201. (1) Except as otherwise provided in this
2 section a contract for the sale of goods for the price of
3 five hundred dollars or more is not enforceable by way of
4 action or defense unless there is [some writing] a record
5 sufficient to indicate that a contract for sale has been
6 made between the parties and signed by the party against
7 whom enforcement is sought or by [his] the party's
8 authorized agent or broker. A [writing] record is not
9 insufficient because it omits or incorrectly states a term
10 agreed upon but the contract is not enforceable under this
11 [paragraph] subsection beyond the quantity of goods shown in
12 [such writing] the record.
13 (2) Between merchants if within a reasonable time a
14 [writing] record in confirmation of the contract and
15 sufficient against the sender is received and the party
16 receiving it has reason to know its contents, it satisfies
17 the requirements of subsection (1) against [such] the party
18 unless [written] notice in a record of objection to its
19 contents is given within ten days after it is received.
SB 1352 15
20 (3) A contract which does not satisfy the requirements
21 of subsection (1) but which is valid in other respects is
22 enforceable
23 (a) if the goods are to be specially manufactured for
24 the buyer and are not suitable for sale to others in the
25 ordinary course of the seller's business and the seller,
26 before notice of repudiation is received and under
27 circumstances which reasonably indicate that the goods are
28 for the buyer, has made either a substantial beginning of
29 their manufacture or commitments for their procurement; or
30 (b) if the party against whom enforcement is sought
31 admits in his pleading, testimony or otherwise in court that
32 a contract for sale was made but the contract is not
33 enforceable under this provision beyond the quantity of
34 goods admitted; or
35 (c) with respect to goods for which payment has been
36 made and accepted or which have been received and accepted
37 (section 400.2-606).
1 400.2-202. Terms with respect to which the
2 confirmatory memoranda of the parties agree or which are
3 otherwise set forth in a [writing] record intended by the
4 parties as a final expression of their agreement with
5 respect to such terms as are included therein may not be
6 contradicted by evidence of any prior agreement or of a
7 contemporaneous oral agreement but may be explained or
8 supplemented
9 (a) by course of dealing or usage of trade (section
10 400.1-205) or by course of performance (section 400.2-208);
11 and
12 (b) by evidence of consistent additional terms unless
13 the court finds the [writing] record to have been intended
SB 1352 16
14 also as a complete and exclusive statement of the terms of
15 the agreement.
1 400.2-203. The affixing of a seal to a [writing]
2 record evidencing a contract for sale or an offer to buy or
3 sell goods does not constitute the [writing] record a sealed
4 instrument and the law with respect to sealed instruments
5 does not apply to such a contract or offer.
1 400.2-205. An offer by a merchant to buy or sell goods
2 in a signed [writing] record which by its terms gives
3 assurance that it will be held open is not revocable, for
4 lack of consideration, during the time stated or if no time
5 is stated for a reasonable time, but in no event may such
6 period of irrevocability exceed three months; but any such
7 term of assurance on a form supplied by the offeree must be
8 separately signed by the offeror.
1 400.2-209. (1) An agreement modifying a contract
2 within this article needs no consideration to be binding.
3 (2) A signed agreement which excludes modification or
4 rescission except by a signed writing or other signed record
5 cannot be otherwise modified or rescinded, but except as
6 between merchants such a requirement on a form supplied by
7 the merchant must be separately signed by the other party.
8 (3) The requirements of the statute of frauds section
9 of this article (section 400.2-201) must be satisfied if the
10 contract as modified is within its provisions.
11 (4) Although an attempt at modification or rescission
12 does not satisfy the requirements of subsection (2) or (3)
13 it can operate as a waiver.
14 (5) A party who has made a waiver affecting an
15 executory portion of the contract may retract the waiver by
16 reasonable notification received by the other party that
17 strict performance will be required of any term waived,
SB 1352 17
18 unless the retraction would be unjust in view of a material
19 change of position in reliance on the waiver.
1 400.2A-102. (1) This Article applies to any
2 transaction, regardless of form, that creates a lease and,
3 in the case of a hybrid lease, it applies to the extent
4 provided in subsection (2).
5 (2) In a hybrid lease:
6 (a) If the lease-of-goods aspects do not predominate:
7 (i) Only the provisions of this Article which relate
8 primarily to the lease-of-goods aspects of the transaction
9 apply, and the provisions that relate primarily to the
10 transaction as a whole do not apply;
11 (ii) Section 400.2A-209 applies if the lease is a
12 finance lease; and
13 (iii) Section 400.2A-407 applies to the promises of
14 the lessee in a finance lease to the extent the promises are
15 consideration for the right to possession and use of the
16 leased goods; and
17 (b) If the lease-of-goods aspects predominate, this
18 Article applies to the transaction, but does not preclude
19 application in appropriate circumstances of other law to
20 aspects of the lease which do not relate to the lease of
21 goods.
1 400.2A-103. (1) In this article unless the context
2 otherwise requires:

5 to him or her is in violation of the ownership rights or
6 security interest or leasehold interest of a third party in

8 business of selling goods of that kind but does not include
9 a pawnbroker. "Buying" may be for cash or by exchange of
SB 1352 18
10 other property or on secured or unsecured credit and

54 the identity of the supplier, unless the lessee has selected

58 lessor's purchase of the goods, and (cc) advised the lessee
59 in writing to contact the supplier for a description of any
60 such rights, or
61 (D) the lease contract discloses all warranties and
62 other rights provided to the lessee by the lessor and
63 supplier in connection with the lease contract and informs
64 the lessee that there are no warranties or other rights
65 provided to the lessee by the lessor and supplier other than
66 those disclosed in the lease contract.
67 (h) "Goods" means all things that are movable at the
68 time of identification to the lease contract, or are
69 fixtures as defined in Section 400.2A-309, but the term does

86 possession and use of goods for a term in return for

191 throughout this article.
SB 1352 24
1 400.2A-107. Any claim or right arising out of an
2 alleged default or breach of warranty may be discharged in
3 whole or in part without consideration by a [written] waiver
4 or renunciation in a signed [and] record delivered by the
5 aggrieved party.
1 400.2A-201. (1) A lease contract is not enforceable
2 by way of action or defense unless:
3 (a) the total payments to be made under the lease
4 contract, excluding payments for options to renew or buy,
5 are less than one thousand dollars; or
6 (b) there is a [writing] record, signed by the party
7 against whom enforcement is sought or by that party's
8 authorized agent, sufficient to indicate that a lease
9 contract has been made between the parties and to describe
10 the goods leased and the lease term.
11 (2) Any description of leased goods or of the lease
12 term is sufficient and satisfies subsection (1)(b), whether
13 or not it is specific, if it reasonably identifies what is
14 described.
15 (3) A [writing] record is not insufficient because it
16 omits or incorrectly states a term agreed upon, but the
17 lease contract is not enforceable under subsection (1)(b)
18 beyond the lease term and the quantity of goods shown in the
19 [writing] record.
20 (4) A lease contract that does not satisfy the
21 requirements of subsection (1), but which is valid in other
22 respects, is enforceable:
23 (a) if the goods are to be specifically manufactured
24 or obtained for the lessee and are not suitable for lease or
25 sale to others in the ordinary course of the lessor's
26 business, and the lessor, before notice of repudiation is
27 received and under circumstances that reasonably indicate
SB 1352 25
28 that the goods are for the lessee, has made either a
29 substantial beginning of their manufacture or commitments
30 for their procurement;
31 (b) if the party against whom enforcement is sought
32 admits in that party's pleading, testimony or otherwise in
33 court that a lease contract was made, but the lease contract
34 is not enforceable under this provision beyond the quantity
35 of goods admitted; or
36 (c) with respect to goods that have been received and
37 accepted by the lessee.
38 (5) The lease term under a lease contract referred to
39 in subsection (4) is:
40 (a) if there is a [writing] record signed by the party
41 against whom enforcement is sought or by that party's
42 authorized agent specifying the lease term, the term so
43 specified;
44 (b) if the party against whom enforcement is sought
45 admits in that party's pleading, testimony, or otherwise in
46 court a lease term, the term so admitted; or
47 (c) a reasonable lease term.
1 400.2A-202. Terms with respect to which the
2 confirmatory memoranda of the parties agree or which are
3 otherwise set forth in a [writing] record intended by the
4 parties as a final expression of their agreement with
5 respect to such terms as are included therein may not be
6 contradicted by evidence of any prior agreement or of a
7 contemporaneous oral agreement but may be explained or
8 supplemented:
9 (a) by course of dealing or usage of trade or by
10 course of performance; and
11 (b) by evidence of consistent additional terms unless
12 the court finds the [writing] record to have been intended
SB 1352 26
13 also as a complete and exclusive statement of the terms of
14 the agreement.
1 400.2A-203. The affixing of a seal to a [writing]
2 record evidencing a lease contract or an offer to enter into
3 a lease contract does not render the [writing] record a
4 sealed instrument and the law with respect to sealed
5 instruments does not apply to the lease contract or offer.
1 400.2A-205. An offer by a merchant to lease goods to
2 or from another person in a signed [writing] record that by
3 its terms gives assurance it will be held open is not
4 revocable, for lack of consideration, during the time stated
5 or, if no time is stated, for a reasonable time, but in no
6 event may the period of irrevocability exceed three months.
7 Any such term of assurance on a form supplied by the offeree
8 must be separately signed by the offeror.
1 400.2A-208. (1) An agreement modifying a lease
2 contract needs no consideration to be binding.
3 (2) A signed lease agreement that excludes
4 modification or rescission except by a signed [writing]
5 record may not be otherwise modified or rescinded, but,
6 except as between merchants, such a requirement on a form
7 supplied by a merchant must be separately signed by the
8 other party.
9 (3) Although an attempt at modification or rescission
10 does not satisfy the requirements of subsection (2), it may
11 operate as a waiver.
12 (4) A party who has made a waiver affecting an
13 executory portion of a lease contract may retract the waiver
14 by reasonable notification received by the other party that
15 strict performance will be required of any term waived,
16 unless the retraction would be unjust in view of a material
17 change of position in reliance on the waiver.

2 and (d), "negotiable instrument" means an unconditional
3 promise or order to pay a fixed amount of money, with or

8 (2) is payable on demand or at a definite time; and
9 (3) does not state any other undertaking or
10 instruction by the person promising or ordering payment to
11 do any act in addition to the payment of money, but the
12 promise or order may contain (i) an undertaking or power to
13 give, maintain, or protect collateral to secure payment,
14 (ii) an authorization or power to the holder to confess
15 judgment or realize on or dispose of collateral, [or] (iii)
16 a waiver of the benefit of any law intended for the
17 advantage or protection of an obligor, (iv) a term that
18 specifies the law that governs the promise or order, or (v)
19 an undertaking to resolve in a specified forum a dispute
20 concerning the promise or order.
21 (b) "Instrument" means a negotiable instrument.
22 (c) An order that meets all of the requirements of
23 subsection (a), except paragraph (1), and otherwise falls
24 within the definition of "check" in subsection (f) is a
25 negotiable instrument and a check.
26 (d) A promise or order other than a check is not an
27 instrument if, at the time it is issued or first comes into
28 possession of a holder, it contains a conspicuous statement,
29 however expressed, to the effect that the promise or order
30 is not negotiable or is not an instrument governed by this
31 Article.
SB 1352 28
32 (e) An instrument is a "note" if it is a promise and
33 is a "draft" if it is an order. If an instrument falls
34 within the definition of both "note" and "draft," a person
35 entitled to enforce the instrument may treat it as either.
36 (f) "Check" means (i) a draft, other than a
37 documentary draft, payable on demand and drawn on a bank or
38 (ii) a cashier's check or teller's check. An instrument may
39 be a check even though it is described on its face by
40 another term, such as "money order."
41 (g) "Cashier's check" means a draft with respect to
42 which the drawer and drawee are the same bank or branches of
43 the same bank.
44 (h) "Teller's check" means a draft drawn by a bank (i)
45 on another bank, or (ii) payable at or through a bank.
46 (i) "Traveler's check" means an instrument that (i) is
47 payable on demand, (ii) is drawn on or payable at or through
48 a bank, (iii) is designated by the term "traveler's check"
49 or by a substantially similar term, and (iv) requires, as a
50 condition to payment, a countersignature by a person whose
51 specimen signature appears on the instrument.
52 (j) "Certificate of deposit" means an instrument
53 containing an acknowledgement by a bank that a sum of money
54 has been received by the bank and a promise by the bank to
55 repay the sum of money. A certificate of deposit is a note
56 of the bank.
57 (k) "Demand draft", a writing not signed by the
58 customer that is created by a third party under the
59 purported authority of the customer for the purpose of
60 charging the customer's account with a bank. A demand draft
61 shall contain the customer's account number and may contain
62 any or all of the following:
63 a. The customer's printed or typewritten name;
SB 1352 29
64 b. A notation that the customer authorized the draft;
65 or
66 c. The statement "No signature required" or words to
67 that effect.
68 A demand draft shall not include a check purportedly
69 drawn by and bearing the signature of a fiduciary, as
70 defined in paragraph (1) of subsection (a) of section 400.3.-
71 307.
1 400.3-105. (a) "Issue" means:
2 (1) the first delivery of an instrument by the maker
3 or drawer, whether to a holder or nonholder, for the purpose
4 of giving rights on the instrument to any person; or
5 (2) if agreed by the payee, the first transmission by
6 the drawer to the payee of an image of an item and
7 information derived from the item that enables the
8 depositary bank to collect the item by transferring or
9 presenting under federal law an electronic check.
10 (b) An unissued instrument, or an unissued incomplete
11 instrument that is completed, is binding on the maker or
12 drawer, but nonissuance is a defense. An instrument that is
13 conditionally issued or is issued for a special purpose is
14 binding on the maker or drawer, but failure of the condition
15 or special purpose to be fulfilled is a defense.
16 (c) "Issuer" applies to issued and unissued
17 instruments and means a maker or drawer of an instrument.
1 400.3-401. [(a)] A person is not liable on an
2 instrument unless (i) the person signed the instrument, or
3 (ii) the person is represented by an agent or representative
4 who signed the instrument and the signature is binding on
5 the represented person under Section 400.3-402.
6 [(b)A signature may be made (i) manually or by means of
7 a device or machine, and (ii) by the use of any name,
SB 1352 30
8 including a trade or assumed name, or by a word, mark, or
9 symbol executed or adopted by a person with present
10 intention to authenticate a writing. ]
1 400.3-604. (a) A person entitled to enforce an
2 instrument, with or without consideration, may discharge the
3 obligation of a party to pay the instrument (i) by an
4 intentional voluntary act, such as surrender of the
5 instrument to the party, destruction, mutilation, or
6 cancellation of the instrument, cancellation or striking out
7 of the party's signature, or the addition of words to the
8 instrument indicating discharge, or (ii) by agreeing not to
9 sue or otherwise renouncing rights against the party by a
10 signed [writing] record. The obligation of a party to pay a
11 check is not discharged solely by destruction of the check
12 in connection with a process in which information is
13 extracted from the check and an image of the check is made
14 and, subsequently, the information and image are transmitted
15 for payment.
16 (b) Cancellation or striking out of an endorsement
17 pursuant to subsection (a) does not affect the status and
18 rights of a party derived from the endorsement.
1 400.4A-103. (a) In this Article:
2 (1) "Payment order" means an instruction of a sender
3 to a receiving bank, transmitted orally[, electronically,]
4 or in [writing] a record, to pay, or to cause another bank
5 to pay, a fixed or determinable amount of money to a
6 beneficiary if:
7 (i) the instruction does not state a condition to
8 payment to the beneficiary other than time of payment;
9 (ii) the receiving bank is to be reimbursed by
10 debiting an account of, or otherwise receiving payment from,
11 the sender; and
SB 1352 31
12 (iii) the instruction is transmitted by the sender
13 directly to the receiving bank or to an agent, funds-
14 transfer system, or communication system for transmittal to
15 the receiving bank;
16 (2) "Beneficiary" means the person to be paid by the
17 beneficiary's bank;
18 (3) "Beneficiary's bank" means the bank identified in
19 a payment order in which an account of the beneficiary is to
20 be credited pursuant to the order or which otherwise is to
21 make payment to the beneficiary if the order does not
22 provide for payment to an account;
23 (4) "Receiving bank" means the bank to which the
24 sender's instruction is addressed;
25 (5) "Sender" means the person giving the instruction
26 to the receiving bank.
27 (b) If an instruction complying with subsection (a)(1)
28 is to make more than one payment to a beneficiary, the
29 instruction is a separate payment order with respect to each
30 payment.
31 (c) A payment order is issued when it is sent to the
32 receiving bank.
1 400.4A-201. "Security procedure" means a procedure
2 established by agreement of a customer and a receiving bank
3 for the purpose of (i) verifying that a payment order or
4 communication amending or cancelling a payment order is that
5 of the customer, or (ii) detecting error in the transmission
6 or the content of the payment order or communication. A
7 security procedure may impose an obligation on the receiving
8 bank or the customer and require the use of algorithms or
9 other codes, identifying words [or], numbers, symbols,
10 sounds, biometrics, encryption, callback procedures, or
11 similar security devices. Comparison of a signature on a
SB 1352 32
12 payment order or communication with an authorized specimen
13 signature of the customer or requiring a payment order to be
14 sent from a known email address, IP address, or telephone
15 number is not by itself a security procedure.
1 400.4A-202. (a) A payment order received by the
2 receiving bank is the authorized order of the person
3 identified as sender if that person authorized the order or
4 is otherwise bound by it under the law of agency.
5 (b) If a bank and its customer have agreed that the
6 authenticity of payment orders issued to the bank in the
7 name of the customer as sender will be verified pursuant to
8 a security procedure, a payment order received by the
9 receiving bank is effective as the order of the customer,
10 whether or not authorized, if (i) the security procedure is
11 a commercially reasonable method of providing security
12 against unauthorized payment orders, and (ii) the bank
13 proves that it accepted the payment order in good faith and
14 in compliance with the bank's obligations under the security
15 procedure and any [written] agreement or instruction of the
16 customer, evidenced by a record, restricting acceptance of
17 payment orders issued in the name of the customer. The bank
18 is not required to follow an instruction that violates [a
19 written] an agreement with the customer, evidenced by a
20 record, or notice of which is not received at a time and in
21 a manner affording the bank a reasonable opportunity to act
22 on it before the payment order is accepted.
23 (c) Commercial reasonableness of a security procedure
24 is a question of law to be determined by considering the
25 wishes of the customer expressed to the bank, the
26 circumstances of the customer known to the bank, including
27 the size, type, and frequency of payment orders normally
28 issued by the customer to the bank, alternative security
SB 1352 33
29 procedures offered to the customer, and security procedures
30 in general use by customers and receiving banks similarly
31 situated. A security procedure is deemed to be commercially
32 reasonable if (i) the security procedure was chosen by the
33 customer after the bank offered, and the customer refused, a
34 security procedure that was commercially reasonable for that
35 customer, and (ii) the customer expressly agreed in
36 [writing] a record to be bound by any payment order, whether
37 or not authorized, issued in its name and accepted by the
38 bank in compliance with the bank's obligations under the
39 security procedure chosen by the customer.
40 (d) The term "sender" in this Article includes the
41 customer in whose name a payment order is issued if the
42 order is the authorized order of the customer under
43 subsection (a), or it is effective as the order of the
44 customer under subsection (b).
45 (e) This section applies to amendments and
46 cancellations of payment orders to the same extent it
47 applies to payment orders.
48 (f) Except as provided in this section and in section
49 400.4A-203(a)(1), rights and obligations arising under this
50 section or section 400.4A-203 may not be varied by agreement.
1 400.4A-203. (a) If an accepted payment order is not,
2 under section 400.4A-202(a), an authorized order of a
3 customer identified as sender, but is effective as an order
4 of the customer pursuant to section 400.4A-202(b), the
5 following rules apply:
6 (1) By express [written] agreement evidenced by a
7 record, the receiving bank may limit the extent to which it
8 is entitled to enforce or retain payment of the payment
9 order.
SB 1352 34
10 (2) The receiving bank is not entitled to enforce or
11 retain payment of the payment order if the customer proves
12 that the order was not caused, directly or indirectly, by a
13 person (i) entrusted at any time with duties to act for the
14 customer with respect to payment orders or the security
15 procedure, or (ii) who obtained access to transmitting
16 facilities of the customer or who obtained, from a source
17 controlled by the customer and without authority of the
18 receiving bank, information facilitating breach of the
19 security procedure, regardless of how the information was
20 obtained or whether the customer was at fault. Information
21 includes any access device, computer software, or the like.
22 (b) This section applies to amendments of payment
23 orders to the same extent it applies to payment orders.
1 400.4A-207. (a) Subject to subsection (b), if, in a
2 payment order received by the beneficiary's bank, the name,
3 bank account number, or other identification of the
4 beneficiary refers to a nonexistent or unidentifiable person
5 or account, no person has rights as a beneficiary of the
6 order and acceptance of the order cannot occur.
7 (b) If a payment order received by the beneficiary's
8 bank identifies the beneficiary both by name and by an
9 identifying or bank account number and the name and number
10 identify different persons, the following rules apply:
11 (1) Except as otherwise provided in subsection 3 of
12 this section, if the beneficiary's bank does not know that
13 the name and number refer to different persons, it may rely
14 on the number as the proper identification of the
15 beneficiary of the order. The beneficiary's bank need not
16 determine whether the name and number refer to the same
17 person.
SB 1352 35
18 (2) If the beneficiary's bank pays the person
19 identified by name or knows that the name and number
20 identify different persons, no person has rights as
21 beneficiary except the person paid by the beneficiary's bank
22 if that person was entitled to receive payment from the
23 originator of the funds transfer. If no person has rights
24 as beneficiary, acceptance of the order cannot occur.
25 (c) If (i) a payment order described in subsection (b)
26 is accepted, (ii) the originator's payment order described
27 the beneficiary inconsistently by name and number, and (iii)
28 the beneficiary's bank pays the person identified by number
29 as permitted by subsection (b)(1), the following rules apply:
30 (1) If the originator is a bank, the originator is
31 obliged to pay its order.
32 (2) If the originator is not a bank and proves that
33 the person identified by number was not entitled to receive
34 payment from the originator, the originator is not obliged
35 to pay its order unless the originator's bank proves that
36 the originator, before acceptance of the originator's order,
37 had notice that payment of a payment order issued by the
38 originator might be made by the beneficiary's bank on the
39 basis of an identifying or bank account number even if it
40 identifies a person different from the named beneficiary.
41 Proof of notice may be made by any admissible evidence. The
42 originator's bank satisfies the burden of proof if it proves
43 that the originator, before the payment order was accepted,
44 signed a [writing] record stating the information to which
45 the notice relates.
46 (d) In a case governed by subsection (b)(1), if the
47 beneficiary's bank rightfully pays the person identified by
48 number and that person was not entitled to receive payment
49 from the originator, the amount paid may be recovered from
SB 1352 36
50 that person to the extent allowed by the law governing
51 mistake and restitution as follows:
52 (1) If the originator is obliged to pay its payment
53 order as stated in subsection (c), the originator has the
54 right to recover;
55 (2) If the originator is not a bank and is not obliged
56 to pay its payment order, the originator's bank has the
57 right to recover.
1 400.4A-208. (a) This subsection applies to a payment
2 order identifying an intermediary bank or the beneficiary's
3 bank only by an identifying number:
4 (1) The receiving bank may rely on the number as the
5 proper identification of the intermediary or beneficiary's
6 bank and need not determine whether the number identifies a
7 bank.
8 (2) The sender is obliged to compensate the receiving
9 bank for any loss and expenses incurred by the receiving
10 bank as a result of its reliance on the number in executing
11 or attempting to execute the order.
12 (b) This subsection applies to a payment order
13 identifying an intermediary bank or the beneficiary's bank
14 both by name and an identifying number if the name and
15 number identify different persons.
16 (1) If the sender is a bank, the receiving bank may
17 rely on the number as the proper identification of the
18 intermediary or beneficiary's bank if the receiving bank,
19 when it executes the sender's order, does not know that the
20 name and number identify different persons. The receiving
21 bank need not determine whether the name and number refer to
22 the same person or whether the number refers to a bank. The
23 sender is obliged to compensate the receiving bank for any
24 loss and expenses incurred by the receiving bank as a result
SB 1352 37
25 of its reliance on the number in executing or attempting to
26 execute the order.
27 (2) If the sender is not a bank and the receiving bank
28 proves that the sender, before the payment order was
29 accepted, had notice that the receiving bank might rely on
30 the number as the proper identification of the intermediary
31 or beneficiary's bank even if it identifies a person
32 different from the bank identified by name, the rights and
33 obligations of the sender and the receiving bank are
34 governed by subsection (b)(1), as though the sender were a
35 bank. Proof of notice may be made by any admissible
36 evidence. The receiving bank satisfies the burden of proof
37 if it proves that the sender, before the payment order was
38 accepted, signed a [writing] record stating the information
39 to which the notice relates.
40 (3) Regardless of whether the sender is a bank, the
41 receiving bank may rely on the name as the proper
42 identification of the intermediary or beneficiary's bank if
43 the receiving bank, at the time it executes the sender's
44 order, does not know that the name and number identify
45 different persons. The receiving bank need not determine
46 whether the name and number refer to the same person.
47 (4) If the receiving bank knows that the name and
48 number identify different persons, reliance on either the
49 name or the number in executing the sender's payment order
50 is a breach of the obligation stated in section 400.4A-
51 302(a)(1).
1 400.4A-210. (a) A payment order is rejected by the
2 receiving bank by a notice of rejection transmitted to the
3 sender orally[, electronically,] or in [writing] a record.
4 A notice of rejection need not use any particular words and
5 is sufficient if it indicates that the receiving bank is
SB 1352 38
6 rejecting the order or will not execute or pay the order.
7 Rejection is effective when the notice is given if
8 transmission is by a means that is reasonable in the
9 circumstances. If notice of rejection is given by a means
10 that is not reasonable, rejection is effective when the
11 notice is received. If an agreement of the sender and
12 receiving bank establishes the means to be used to reject a
13 payment order, (i) any means complying with the agreement is
14 reasonable and (ii) any means not complying is not
15 reasonable unless no significant delay in receipt of the
16 notice resulted from the use of the noncomplying means.
17 (b) This subsection applies if a receiving bank other
18 than the beneficiary's bank fails to execute a payment order
19 despite the existence on the execution date of a
20 withdrawable credit balance in an authorized account of the
21 sender sufficient to cover the order. If the sender does
22 not receive notice of rejection of the order on the
23 execution date and the authorized account of the sender does
24 not bear interest, the bank is obliged to pay interest to
25 the sender on the amount of the order for the number of days
26 elapsing after the execution date to the earlier of the day
27 the order is cancelled pursuant to section 400.4A-211(d) or
28 the day the sender receives notice or learns that the order
29 was not executed, counting the final day of the period as an
30 elapsed day. If the withdrawable credit balance during that
31 period falls below the amount of the order, the amount of
32 interest is reduced accordingly.
33 (c) If a receiving bank suspends payments, all
34 unaccepted payment orders issued to it are deemed rejected
35 at the time the bank suspends payments.
SB 1352 39
36 (d) Acceptance of a payment order precludes a later
37 rejection of the order. Rejection of a payment order
38 precludes a later acceptance of the order.
1 400.4A-211. (a) A communication of the sender of a
2 payment order cancelling or amending the order may be
3 transmitted to the receiving bank orally[, electronically,]
4 or in [writing] a record. If a security procedure is in
5 effect between the sender and the receiving bank, the
6 communication is not effective to cancel or amend the order
7 unless the communication is verified pursuant to the
8 security procedure or the bank agrees to the cancellation or
9 amendment.
10 (b) Subject to subsection (a), a communication by the
11 sender cancelling or amending a payment order is effective
12 to cancel or amend the order if notice of the communication
13 is received at a time and in a manner affording the
14 receiving bank a reasonable opportunity to act on the
15 communication before the bank accepts the payment order.
16 (c) After a payment order has been accepted,
17 cancellation or amendment of the order is not effective
18 unless the receiving bank agrees or a funds-transfer system
19 rule allows cancellation or amendment without agreement of
20 the bank.
21 (1) With respect to a payment order accepted by a
22 receiving bank other than the beneficiary's bank,
23 cancellation or amendment is not effective unless a
24 conforming cancellation or amendment of the payment order
25 issued by the receiving bank is also made.
26 (2) With respect to a payment order accepted by the
27 beneficiary's bank, cancellation or amendment is not
28 effective unless the order was issued in execution of an
29 unauthorized payment order, or because of a mistake by a
SB 1352 40
30 sender in the funds transfer which resulted in the issuance
31 of a payment order (i) that is a duplicate of a payment
32 order previously issued by the sender, (ii) that orders
33 payment to a beneficiary not entitled to receive payment
34 from the originator, or (iii) that orders payment in an
35 amount greater than the amount the beneficiary was entitled
36 to receive from the originator. If the payment order is
37 cancelled or amended, the beneficiary's bank is entitled to
38 recover from the beneficiary any amount paid to the
39 beneficiary to the extent allowed by the law governing
40 mistake and restitution.
41 (d) An unaccepted payment order is cancelled by
42 operation of law at the close of the fifth funds-transfer
43 business day of the receiving bank after the execution date
44 or payment date of the order.
45 (e) A cancelled payment order cannot be accepted. If
46 an accepted payment order is cancelled, the acceptance is
47 nullified and no person has any right or obligation based on
48 the acceptance. Amendment of a payment order is deemed to
49 be cancellation of the original order at the time of
50 amendment and issue of a new payment order in the amended
51 form at the same time.
52 (f) Unless otherwise provided in an agreement of the
53 parties or in a funds-transfer system rule, if the receiving
54 bank, after accepting a payment order, agrees to
55 cancellation or amendment of the order by the sender or is
56 bound by a funds-transfer system rule allowing cancellation
57 or amendment without the bank's agreement, the sender,
58 whether or not cancellation or amendment is effective, is
59 liable to the bank for any loss and expenses, including
60 reasonable attorney's fees, incurred by the bank as a result
SB 1352 41
61 of the cancellation or amendment or attempted cancellation
62 or amendment.
63 (g) A payment order is not revoked by the death or
64 legal incapacity of the sender unless the receiving bank
65 knows of the death or of an adjudication of incapacity by a
66 court of competent jurisdiction and has reasonable
67 opportunity to act before acceptance of the order.
68 (h) A funds-transfer system rule is not effective to
69 the extent it conflicts with subsection (c)(2).
1 400.4A-305. (a) If a funds transfer is completed but
2 execution of a payment order by the receiving bank in breach
3 of section 400.4A-302 results in delay in payment to the
4 beneficiary, the bank is obliged to pay interest to either
5 the originator or the beneficiary of the funds transfer for
6 the period of delay caused by the improper execution.
7 Except as provided in subsection (c), additional damages are
8 not recoverable.
9 (b) If execution of a payment order by a receiving
10 bank in breach of section 400.4A-302 results in (i)
11 noncompletion of the funds transfer, (ii) failure to use an
12 intermediary bank designated by the originator, or (iii)
13 issuance of a payment order that does not comply with the
14 terms of the payment order of the originator, the bank is
15 liable to the originator for its expenses in the funds
16 transfer and for incidental expenses and interest losses, to
17 the extent not covered by subsection (a), resulting from the
18 improper execution. Except as provided in subsection (c),
19 additional damages are not recoverable.
20 (c) In addition to the amounts payable under
21 subsections (a) and (b), damages, including consequential
22 damages, are recoverable to the extent provided in an
SB 1352 42
23 express [written] agreement of the receiving bank, evidenced
24 by a record.
25 (d) If a receiving bank fails to execute a payment
26 order it was obliged by express agreement to execute, the
27 receiving bank is liable to the sender for its expenses in
28 the transaction and for incidental expenses and interest
29 losses resulting from the failure to execute. Additional
30 damages, including consequential damages, are recoverable to
31 the extent provided in an express [written] agreement of the
32 receiving bank, evidenced by a record, but are not otherwise
33 recoverable.
34 (e) Reasonable attorney's fees are recoverable if
35 demand for compensation under subsection (a) or (b) is made
36 and refused before an action is brought on the claim. If a
37 claim is made for breach of an agreement under subsection
38 (d) and the agreement does not provide for damages,
39 reasonable attorney's fees are recoverable if demand for
40 compensation under subsection (d) is made and refused before
41 an action is brought on the claim.
42 (f) Except as stated in this section, the liability of
43 a receiving bank under subsections (a) and (b) may not be
44 varied by agreement.
1 400.5-104. A letter of credit, confirmation, advice,
2 transfer, amendment or cancellation may be issued in any
3 form that is a signed record [and is authenticated:
4 (i) By a signature; or
5 (ii) In accordance with the agreement of the parties
6 or the standard practice referred to in section 400.5-
7 108(e)].
1 400.5-116. (a) The liability of an issuer, nominated
2 person or adviser for action or omission is governed by the
3 law of the jurisdiction chosen by an agreement in the form
SB 1352 43
4 of a record signed [or otherwise authenticated] by the
5 affected parties [in the manner provided in section 400.5-
6 104] or by a provision in the person's letter of credit,
7 confirmation or other undertaking. The jurisdiction whose
8 law is chosen need not bear any relation to the transaction.
9 (b) Unless subsection (a) applies, the liability of an
10 issuer, nominated person or adviser for action or omission
11 is governed by the law of the jurisdiction in which the
12 person is located. The person is considered to be located
13 at the address indicated in the person's undertaking. If
14 more than one address is indicated, the person is considered
15 to be located at the address from which the person's
16 undertaking was issued.
17 (c) For the purpose of jurisdiction, choice of law and
18 recognition of interbranch letters of credit, but not
19 enforcement of a judgment, all branches of a bank are
20 considered separate juridical entities and a bank is
21 considered to be located at the place where its relevant
22 branch is considered to be located under [this] subsection
23 (d).
24 (d) A branch of a bank is considered to be located at

79 pursuant to the law of the jurisdiction designated in
80 section 400.9-301(1) or 400.9-305(c) is effective to perfect

91 expiration of the four-month period, it remains perfected
92 thereafter. If the security interest does not become
93 perfected under the law of the other jurisdiction before the

113 law of the jurisdiction designated in section 400.9-301(1)
114 or 400.9-305(c) or the expiration of the four-month period
115 remains perfected thereafter. A security interest that is
116 perfected by the financing statement but that does not
117 become perfected under the law of the other jurisdiction

8 or the account debtor to, the assignment or transfer of, or
9 creation, attachment, or perfection of a security interest
10 in, the promissory note, health-care-insurance receivable,

13 (1) Would impair the creation, attachment, or
14 perfection of a security interest; or
15 (2) Provides that the assignment or transfer or the
16 creation, attachment, or perfection of the security interest

17 in Global and National Commerce Act, 15 U.S.C. Section
18 7021(a)(1), as amended.
19 (4) "Value" has the meaning provided in section 400.3-

21 "instrument" were references to a controllable account,
22 controllable electronic record, or controllable payment
23 intangible.
24 (b) The definitions in Article 9 of "account debtor",
25 "controllable account", "controllable payment intangible",
26 "chattel paper", "deposit account", "electronic money", and

3 or controllable payment intangible, including the rights and
4 benefits under subsections (c), (d), (e), (g), and (h) of a
5 purchaser and qualifying purchaser, in the same manner this
6 section applies to a controllable electronic record.
7 (b) To determine whether a purchaser of a controllable
8 account or a controllable payment intangible is a qualifying
9 purchaser, the purchaser obtains control of the account or
10 payment intangible if it obtains control of the controllable
SB 1352 159
11 electronic record that evidences the account or payment
12 intangible.
13 (c) Except as provided in this section, law other than
14 this article determines whether a person acquires a right in
15 a controllable electronic record and the right the person
16 acquires.
17 (d) A purchaser of a controllable electronic record
18 acquires all rights in the controllable electronic record
19 that the transferor had or had power to transfer, except
20 that a purchaser of a limited interest in a controllable
21 electronic record acquires rights only to the extent of the
22 interest purchased.
23 (e) A qualifying purchaser acquires its rights in the
24 controllable electronic record free of a claim of a property
25 right in the controllable electronic record.
26 (f) Except as provided in subsections (a) and (e) for
27 a controllable account and a controllable payment intangible
28 or law other than this article, a qualifying purchaser takes
29 a right to payment, right to performance, or other interest
30 in property evidenced by the controllable electronic record
31 subject to a claim of a property right in the right to
32 payment, right to performance, or other interest in property.
33 (g) An action may not be asserted against a qualifying
34 purchaser based on both a purchase by the qualifying
35 purchaser of a controllable electronic record and a claim of
36 a property right in another controllable electronic record,
37 whether the action is framed in conversion, replevin,
38 constructive trust, equitable lien, or other theory.
39 (h) Filing of a financing statement under Article 9 is
40 not notice of a claim of a property right in a controllable
41 electronic record.

23 attached to or logically associated with the electronic
24 record, or a system in which the electronic record is
25 recorded limits the use of the electronic record or has a
26 protocol programmed to cause a change, including a transfer
27 or loss of control or a modification of benefits afforded by
28 the electronic record; or
29 (2) The power is shared with another person.
30 (c) A power of a person is not shared with another
31 person under subsection (b)(2) and the person's power is not
32 exclusive if:

55 (f) A person that has control under this section is
56 not required to acknowledge that it has control on behalf of
57 another person.
58 (g) If a person acknowledges that it has or will
59 obtain control on behalf of another person, unless the
60 person otherwise agrees or law other than this article or
61 Article 9 otherwise provides, the person does not owe any
62 duty to the other person and is not required to confirm the
63 acknowledgment to any other person.
SB 1352 162

15 the person to which control was transferred;
16 (2) Reasonably identifies the controllable account or

SB 1352 163
32 (d) Subject to subsection (h), notification is
33 ineffective under subsection (b):
34 (1) Unless, before the notification is sent, the
35 account debtor and the person that, at that time, had
36 control of the controllable electronic record that evidences
37 the controllable account or controllable payment intangible
38 agree in a signed record to a commercially reasonable method
39 by which a person may furnish reasonable proof that control
40 has been transferred;
41 (2) To the extent an agreement between the account
42 debtor and seller of a payment intangible limits the account
43 debtor's duty to pay a person other than the seller and the
44 limitation is effective under law other than this article; or
45 (3) At the option of the account debtor, if the
46 notification notifies the account debtor to:
47 (A) Divide a payment;
48 (B) Make less than the full amount of an installment
49 or other periodic payment; or
50 (C) pay any part of a payment by more than one method
51 or to more than one person.
52 (e) Subject to subsection (h), if requested by the
53 account debtor, the person giving the notification under
54 subsection (b) seasonably shall furnish reasonable proof,
55 using the method in the agreement referred to in subsection
56 (d)(1), that control of the controllable electronic record
57 has been transferred. Unless the person complies with the

59 paying a person that formerly had control, even if the
60 account debtor has received a notification under subsection
61 (b).
62 (f) A person furnishes reasonable proof under
63 subsection (e) that control has been transferred if the

78 article which establishes a different rule for an account
79 debtor who is an individual and who incurred the obligation
80 primarily for personal, family, or household purposes.
1 400.12-107. (a) Except as provided in subsection (b),
2 the local law of a controllable electronic record's
3 jurisdiction governs a matter covered by this article.
4 (b) For a controllable electronic record that
5 evidences a controllable account or controllable payment
6 intangible, the local law of the controllable electronic
7 record's jurisdiction governs a matter covered by section
8 400.12-106 unless an effective agreement determines that the
9 local law of another jurisdiction governs.
10 (c) The following rules determine a controllable
11 electronic record's jurisdiction under this section:
12 (1) If the controllable electronic record, or a record
13 attached to or logically associated with the controllable
14 electronic record and readily available for review,
15 expressly provides that a particular jurisdiction is the
SB 1352 165
16 controllable electronic record's jurisdiction for purposes
17 of this article or this chapter, that jurisdiction is the
18 controllable electronic record's jurisdiction.
19 (2) If paragraph (1) does not apply and the rules of
20 the system in which the controllable electronic record is
21 recorded are readily available for review and expressly
22 provide that a particular jurisdiction is the controllable
23 electronic record's jurisdiction for purposes of this
24 article or this chapter, that jurisdiction is the
25 controllable electronic record's jurisdiction.
26 (3) If paragraphs (1) and (2) do not apply and the
27 controllable electronic record, or a record attached to or
28 logically associated with the controllable electronic record
29 and readily available for review, expressly provides that
30 the controllable electronic record is governed by the law of
31 a particular jurisdiction, that jurisdiction is the
32 controllable electronic record's jurisdiction.
33 (4) If paragraphs (1), (2), and (3) do not apply and
34 the rules of the system in which the controllable electronic
35 record is recorded are readily available for review and
36 expressly provide that the controllable electronic record or
37 the system is governed by the law of a particular
38 jurisdiction, that jurisdiction is the controllable
39 electronic record's jurisdiction.
40 (5) If paragraphs (1) through (4) do not apply, the
41 controllable electronic record's jurisdiction is the
42 District of Columbia.
43 (d) If subsection (c)(5) applies and Article 12 is not
44 in effect in the District of Columbia without material
45 modification, the governing law for a matter covered by this
46 article is the law of the District of Columbia as though
47 Article 12 were in effect in the District of Columbia
SB 1352 166
48 without material modification. In this subsection, "Article
49 12" means Article 12 of Uniform Commercial Code Amendments
50 (2022).
51 (e) To the extent subsections (a) and (b) provide that
52 the local law of the controllable electronic record's
53 jurisdiction governs a matter covered by this article, that

55 matter relates does not bear any relation to the
56 controllable electronic record's jurisdiction.
57 (f) The rights acquired under Section 400.12-104 by a
58 purchaser or qualifying purchaser are governed by the law
59 applicable under this section at the time of purchase.

5 flowing from the transaction remain valid thereafter and may
6 be terminated, completed, consummated, or enforced as
7 required or permitted by law other than this chapter or, if
8 applicable, this chapter, as though this act had not taken
9 effect.
1 400.199-301. (a) Except as provided in sections

7 (b) Except as provided in subsection (c) and sections
8 400.199-302 through 400.199-306:
9 (1) A transaction, lien, or interest in property that

14 transferred on or after August 28, 2024, including the
15 rights, duties, and interests flowing from the transaction,
16 lien, or interest, remains valid on and after August 28,

18 (2) The transaction, lien, or interest may be
19 terminated, completed, consummated, and enforced as required
20 or permitted by this act or by the law that would apply if
21 this act had not taken effect.
22 (c) This act does not affect an action, case, or
23 proceeding commenced before August 28, 2024.
1 400.199-302. (a) A security interest that is
2 enforceable and perfected immediately before August 28, 2024
SB 1352 168
3 is a perfected security interest under this act if, on
4 August 28, 2024, the requirements for enforceability and
5 perfection under this act are satisfied without further
6 action.
7 (b) If a security interest is enforceable and
8 perfected immediately before August 28, 2024, but the
9 requirements for enforceability or perfection under this act
10 are not satisfied on August 28, 2024, the security interest:
11 (1) Is a perfected security interest until the earlier
12 of the time perfection would have ceased under the law in
13 effect immediately before August 28, 2024, or the adjustment
14 date;
15 (2) Remains enforceable thereafter only if the
16 security interest satisfies the requirements for
17 enforceability under section 400.9-203, as amended by this
18 act, before the adjustment date; and
19 (3) Remains perfected thereafter only if the
20 requirements for perfection under this act are satisfied
21 before the time specified in paragraph (1).
1 400.199-303. A security interest that is enforceable
2 immediately before August 28, 2024, but is unperfected at
3 that time:
4 (1) Remains an enforceable security interest until the
5 adjustment date;
6 (2) Remains enforceable thereafter if the security
7 interest becomes enforceable under section 400.9-203, as
8 amended by this act, on August 28, 2024, or before the
9 adjustment date; and
10 (3) Becomes perfected:

13 before or at that time; or
SB 1352 169
14 (B) When the requirements for perfection are satisfied
15 if the requirements are satisfied after that time.
1 400.199-304. (a) If action, other than the filing of
2 a financing statement, is taken before August 28, 2024, and
3 the action would have resulted in perfection of the security
4 interest had the security interest become enforceable before
5 August 28, 2024, the action is effective to perfect a
6 security interest that attaches under this act before the
7 adjustment date. An attached security interest becomes
8 unperfected on the adjustment date unless the security
9 interest becomes a perfected security interest under this
10 act before the adjustment date.
11 (b) The filing of a financing statement before August
12 28, 2024, is effective to perfect a security interest on
13 August 28, 2024, to the extent the filing would satisfy the
14 requirements for perfection under this act.
15 (c) The taking of an action before August 28, 2024, is
16 sufficient for the enforceability of a security interest on
17 August 28, 2024, if the action would satisfy the
18 requirements for enforceability under this act.
1 400.199-305. (a) Subject to subsections (b) and (c),

7 determines priority.
8 (c) On the adjustment date, to the extent the
9 priorities determined by Article 9 as amended by this act
10 modify the priorities established before August 28, 2024,
11 the priorities of claims to Article 12 property and
SB 1352 170
12 electronic money established before August 28, 2024, cease
13 to apply.
1 400.199-306. (a) Subject to subsections (b) and (c),
2 Article 12 determines the priority of conflicting claims to
3 Article 12 property when the priority rules of Article 9 as
4 amended by this act do not apply.
5 (b) Subject to subsection (c), when the priority rules
6 of Article 9 as amended by this act do not apply and the
7 priorities of claims to Article 12 property were established
8 before August 28, 2024, law other than Article 12 determines
9 priority.
10 (c) When the priority rules of Article 9 as amended by
11 this act do not apply, to the extent the priorities
12 determined by this act modify the priorities established
13 before August 28, 2024, the priorities of claims to Article
14 12 property established before August 28, 2024, cease to
15 apply on the adjustment date.
