36 other than the political subdivision, towards any new construction or improvements on such
37 real property completed after January 1, 2008, and which are included in the above-
38 mentioned possessory interest, regardless of the year in which such costs were incurred or
39 whether such costs were considered in any prior year. The assessor shall annually assess all
40 real property in the following manner: new assessed values shall be determined as of January
41 first of each odd-numbered year and shall be entered in the assessor's books; those same
42 assessedvalues shall applyin the followingeven-numbered year, except for new construction
43 and property improvements which shall be valued as though they had been completed as of
44 January first of the preceding odd-numbered year. The assessor may call at the office, place

55 commission and the assessor and the governing body of the county involved are unable to
56 resolve the differences, in order to receive state cost-share funds outlined in section 137.750,
57 the county or the assessor shall petition the administrative hearing commission, by May first,
58 to decide all matters in dispute regarding the assessment maintenance plan. Upon agreement
59 of the parties, the matter may be stayed while the parties proceed with mediation or
60 arbitration upon terms agreed to by the parties. The final decision of the administrative
61 hearing commission shall be subject to judicial review in the circuit court of the county
62 involved. In the event a valuation of subclass (1) real property within any county with a
63 charter form of government, or within a city not within a county, is made by a computer,
64 computer-assisted method or a computer program, the burden of proof, supported by clear,
65 convincing and cogent evidence to sustain such valuation, shall be on the assessor at any
66 hearing or appeal. In any such county, unless the assessor proves otherwise, there shall be a
67 presumption that the assessment was made by a computer, computer-assisted method or a
68 computer program. Such evidence shall include, but shall not be limited to, the following:
69 [(1)] (a) The findings of the assessor based on an appraisal of the property by
70 generally accepted appraisal techniques; and
HB 1669 4
71 [(2)] (b) The purchase prices from sales of at least three comparable properties and
72 the address or location thereof. As used in this subdivision, the word "comparable" means
73 that:
74 [(a)] a. Such sale was closed at a date relevant to the property valuation; and
75 [(b)] b. Such properties are not more than one mile from the site of the disputed
76 property, except where no similar properties exist within one mile of the disputed property,
77 the nearest comparable property shall be used. Such property shall be within five hundred
78 square feet in size of the disputed property, and resemble the disputed property in age, floor
79 plan, number of rooms, and other relevant characteristics.
80 2. Assessors in each county of this state and the City of St. Louis may send personal
81 property assessment forms through the mail.
82 3. Except as otherwise provided under section 137.102, the following items of
83 personal property shall each constitute separate subclasses of tangible personal property and
84 shall be assessed and valued for the purposes of taxation at the following percentages of their
85 true value in money:
86 (1) Grain and other agricultural crops in an unmanufactured condition, one-half of
87 one percent;
88 (2) Livestock, twelve percent through December 31, 2033; for all calendar years
89 beginning on or after January 1, 2034, six percent;

91 years beginning on or after January 1, 2034, six percent;

93 motor vehicles pursuant to section 301.131 and aircraft which are at least twenty-five years
94 old and which are used solely for noncommercial purposes and are operated less than two
95 hundred hours per year or aircraft that are home built from a kit, five percent;
96 (5) Poultry, twelve percent through December 31, 2033; for all calendar years

99 retooling for the purpose of introducing new product lines or used for making improvements
100 to existing products by any company which is located in a state enterprise zone and which is

102 135.200, twenty-five percent through December 31, 2033; for all calendar years
103 beginning on or after January 1, 2034, six percent.

107 then be delivered to the assessor.

116 or purpose of such real property is changed after such property is assessed under the
117 provisions of this chapter. If the assessor determines that such property shall be reclassified,
118 he or she shall determine the assessment under this subsection based on the percentage of the
119 tax year that such property was classified in each subclassification.
120 6. Manufactured homes, as defined in section 700.010, which are actually used as
121 dwelling units shall be assessed at the same percentage of true value as residential real
122 property for the purpose of taxation. The percentage of assessment of true value for such
123 manufactured homes shall be the same as for residential real property. If the county collector
124 cannot identify or find the manufactured home when attempting to attach the manufactured
125 home for payment of taxes owed by the manufactured home owner, the county collector may
126 request the county commission to have the manufactured home removed from the tax books,
127 and such request shall be granted within thirty days after the request is made; however, the
128 removal from the tax books does not remove the tax lien on the manufactured home if it is
129 later identified or found. For purposes of this section, a manufactured home located in a
130 manufactured home rental park, rental community or on real estate not owned by the
131 manufactured home owner shall be considered personal property. For purposes of this
132 section, a manufactured home located on real estate owned by the manufactured home owner
133 may be considered real property.
134 7. Each manufactured home assessed shall be considered a parcel for the purpose of
135 reimbursement pursuant to section 137.750, unless the manufactured home is deemed to be
136 realestate asdefined in subsection7 of section442.015 and assessedas a realtyimprovement
137 to the existing real estate parcel.
138 8. Any amount of tax due and owing based on the assessment of a manufactured
139 home shall be included on the personal property tax statement of the manufactured home
140 owner unless the manufactured home is deemed to be real estate as defined in subsection 7 of
141 section 442.015, in which case the amount of tax due and owing on the assessment of the
142 manufactured home as a realty improvement to the existing real estate parcel shall be
143 included on the real property tax statement of the real estate owner.

150 two years old or newer from a vehicle's model year, the assessor may use a value other than
151 average without performing a physical inspection of the motor vehicle. In the absence of a
152 listing for a particular motor vehicle in such publication, the assessor shall use such
153 information or publications which in the assessor's judgment will fairly estimate the true
154 value in money of the motor vehicle.
155 10. Before the assessor may increase the assessed valuation of any parcel of subclass
156 (1) real property by more than fifteen percent since the last assessment, excluding increases
157 due to new construction or improvements, the assessor shall conduct a physical inspection of
158 such property.
159 11. If a physical inspection is required, pursuant to subsection 10 of this section, the
160 assessor shall notify the property owner of that fact in writing and shall provide the owner
161 clear written notice of the owner's rights relating to the physical inspection. If a physical
162 inspection is required, the property owner may request that an interior inspection be
163 performed during the physical inspection. The owner shall have no less than thirty days to
164 notify the assessor of a request for an interior physical inspection.
