112 subsection 1 of section 142.803 is collected at the time of
113 fueling, an operator of a propane fueling station that uses
114 quick-connect fueling nozzles may sell propane as a motor
115 fuel without verifying the application of a valid Missouri

119 such owner or operator shall not be eligible for a refund of
120 the motor fuel tax paid at such refueling.

125 fee. Applications for such decals shall be supplied by the
126 department of revenue. In the case of a motor vehicle which
127 is not in operation by January thirty-first of any year, a
128 decal may be purchased for a fractional period of such year,
129 and the amount of the decal fee shall be reduced by one-

140 issued.

145 vehicle upon a change of ownership and is reinstalled in
146 another motor vehicle, upon such reinstallation. Such
147 transfers shall be accomplished in accordance with rules and
148 regulations promulgated by the director.
149 [9.] 10. It shall be unlawful for any person to
150 operate a motor vehicle required to have an alternative fuel
151 decal upon the highways of this state without a valid decal

154 stations that collect the motor fuel tax.
155 [10.] 11. No person shall cause to be put, or put, any
156 alternative fuel into the fuel supply receptacle or battery
157 of a motor vehicle required to have an alternative fuel

160 collected at the time of such fueling.
