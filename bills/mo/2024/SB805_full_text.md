INTRODUCED BY SENATOR BLACK.
4166S.01I KRISTINA MARTIN, Secretary
AN ACT
To repeal sections 393.170 and 523.010, RSMo, and to enact in lieu thereof three new sections
relating to electric utilities.
Be it enacted by the General Assembly of the State of Missouri, as follows:
1 Section A. Sections 393.170 and 523.010, RSMo, are
2 repealed and three new sections enacted in lieu thereof, to be
3 known as sections 393.170, 393.172, and 523.010, to read as
4 follows:
1 393.170. 1. No gas corporation, electrical
2 corporation, water corporation or sewer corporation shall
3 begin construction of a gas plant, electric plant, water
4 system or sewer system, other than an energy generation unit
5 that has a capacity of one megawatt or less, without first
6 having obtained the permission and approval of the
7 commission.
8 2. No such corporation shall exercise any right or
9 privilege under any franchise hereafter granted, or under
10 any franchise heretofore granted but not heretofore actually
11 exercised, or the exercise of which shall have been
12 suspended for more than one year, without first having
13 obtained the permission and approval of the commission.
14 Before such certificate shall be issued a certified copy of
15 the charter of such corporation shall be filed in the office
16 of the commission, together with a verified statement of the
17 president and secretary of the corporation, showing that it
SB 805 2
18 has received the required consent of the proper municipal
19 authorities.
20 3. The commission shall have the power to grant the
21 permission and approval herein specified whenever it shall
22 after due hearing determine that such construction or such
23 exercise of the right, privilege or franchise is necessary
24 or convenient for the public service. The commission may by
25 its order impose such condition or conditions as it may deem
26 reasonable and necessary. Unless exercised within a period
27 of two years from the grant thereof, authority conferred by
28 such certificate of convenience and necessity issued by the
29 commission shall be null and void.
30 4. (1) The provisions of this subsection shall apply
31 when the permission and approval sought from the commission
32 under subsection 1 of this section is for the construction
33 of electric transmission facilities approved by a regional
34 transmission operator. To the greatest extent practical,
35 such electric transmission facilities shall be designed,
36 consistent with electric industry standards, to utilize a
37 multi-circuit configuration, be sited with or along existing
38 above-ground infrastructure, or replace or upgrade existing
39 above-ground infrastructure, whether or not the existing
40 electric transmission facility infrastructure utilized is
41 owned by an electrical corporation that owns in-service
42 electric transmission facilities in this state that are
43 under the functional control of a regional transmission
44 operator. Electric transmission facilities need not be
45 designed as provided in the immediately preceding sentence
46 if the commission determines in a proceeding pursuant to
47 which permission and approval is sought under subsection 1
48 of this section that such a design is inconsistent with
49 electric industry standards, is inconsistent with the
SB 805 3
50 reliability basis given for the electric transmission
51 facilities project, or is not in the best interest of the
52 electrical corporation's customers or, to the extent the
53 electrical corporation does not directly serve retail
54 customers, the interests of the electric customers whose
55 retail rates will reflect the majority of the costs of the
56 electric transmission facilities to-be-constructed. In
57 addition, to the extent such electric transmission
58 facilities will be sited with or along or will replace or
59 upgrade existing above-ground electrical infrastructure that
60 is not owned by an entity seeking permission and approval
61 pursuant to an application filed under subsection 1 of this
62 section or by its affiliate, the entity or entities that
63 will own the new electric transmission facilities subject to
64 the application shall obtain from the underlying fee owners
65 independent real estate rights necessary to accommodate the
66 installation and operation thereof. Nothing in this
67 subdivision shall relieve such entity or entities of the
68 obligations contained in sections 523.039 or 523.256, to the
69 extent those obligations would otherwise apply.
70 (2) In addition to the design requirements in
71 subdivision (1) of this subsection, each electrical
72 corporation seeking permission and approval under subsection
73 1 of this section shall competitively bid the major
74 construction components of each project for which permission
75 and approval is sought and shall utilize competitive
76 sourcing strategies for all related major materials.
77 (3) Only electrical corporations that own in-service
78 electric transmission facilities in this state that are
79 under the functional control of a regional transmission
80 operator and to which the electric transmission facilities
81 subject to the application will connect, either initially or
SB 805 4
82 once construction of all electric transmission facilities
83 approved by the regional transmission operator as of the
84 time of the commission's approval of the application are
85 completed, may file applications with the commission for
86 permission and approval to construct the electric
87 transmission facilities described in this subsection.
88 Within ninety days following approval of the construction of
89 electric transmission facilities by the applicable regional
90 transmission operator, an electric corporation seeking
91 permission and approval for electric transmission facilities
92 under the provisions of this subsection may notify the
93 commission that it will not construct any or some portion of
94 the facilities approved. If such notice is given and
95 indicates the notifying electrical corporation will not
96 construct any of the facilities approved, the commission may
97 grant permission and approval for such facilities'
98 construction to any other electrical corporation. If such
99 notice indicates that it will assign all or a portion of the
100 facilities approved to another electrical corporation, the
101 commission may grant permission and approval for the
102 facilities that were assigned to the assignee electrical
103 corporation and such electrical corporation's construction
104 of the facilities will be subject to this subsection.
105 (4) This subsection shall not limit the right of any
106 electrical corporation to seek permission and approval from
107 the commission to construct, operate, and maintain electric
108 transmission facilities in this state that will not
109 initially connect to electric transmission facilities in
110 this state that are not under the functional control of a
111 regional transmission operator. This subsection shall also
112 not limit the right of any electrical corporation, any
113 municipal utility operating under chapter 91, any joint
SB 805 5
114 electric utility commission operating under chapter 393, any
115 rural electric cooperative organized or operating under
116 chapter 394, any corporation organized on a nonprofit or a
117 cooperative basis as described in subsection 1 of section
118 394.200, or any electrical corporation operating under the
119 not-for-profit cooperative business plan as described in
120 subsection 2 of section 393.110 to construct, operate, and
121 maintain electric transmission facilities in this state that
122 are not under the functional control of a regional
123 transmission operator.
124 (5) In considering applications under this subsection,
125 the commission shall take into account the importance of
126 construction of electric transmission facilities in the
127 state needed to support Missouri's economy, the benefits of
128 electric transmission facility construction to Missouri
129 customers, and the importance of transmission facility
130 construction in ensuring reliable electric service in the
131 state in the twenty-first century and beyond.
132 (6) For the purposes of this subsection, the following
133 terms shall mean:
134 (a) "Electric transmission facilities", a transmission
135 line that is designed and constructed with the capability of
136 being safely and reliably energized at one hundred kilovolts

70 cooperative, as provided in chapter 394, the power to
71 condemn property which is currently used by another provider
72 of public utility service, including a municipality or a
73 special purpose district, when such property is used or
74 useful in providing utility services, if the public utility
75 or cooperative seeking to condemn such property, directly or
76 indirectly, will use or proposes to use the property for the
77 same purpose, or a purpose substantially similar to the
78 purpose for which the property is being used by the provider
79 of the public utility service.
SB 805 9
80 5. A public utility or a rural electric cooperative
81 may only condemn the property of another provider of public
82 utility service, even if the property is used or useful in
83 providing utility services by such provider, if the
84 condemnation is necessary for the public purpose of
85 acquiring a nonexclusive easement or right-of-way across the
86 property of such provider and only if the acquisition will
87 not materially impair or interfere with the current use of
88 such property by the utility or cooperative and will not
89 prevent or materially impair such provider of public utility
90 service from any future expansion of its facilities on such
91 property.
92 6. If a public utility or rural electric cooperative
93 seeks to condemn the property of another provider of public
94 utility service, and the conditions in subsection 4 of this
