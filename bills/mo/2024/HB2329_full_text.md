45 the area to be excavated, or by electronic white lining when available through the
46 notificationcenter. Suchinformationmaybeprovidedtothenotificationcenterpriorto
47 or with the notification required under this section.
48 4. The notification center receiving such notice shall solicit all information required
49 by subsection 2 of this section and shall require the excavator to provide all such information
HB 2329 8
50 before notice by the excavator is deemed to be completed pursuant to sections 319.015 to
51 319.050. The notification center shall transmit all details of such notice as required by this
52 section.
53 [4.] 5. A record of each notice of intent to excavate shall be maintained by the
54 notification center for a period of five years. The record shall include the date the notice was
55 received and all information required by subsection 2 of this section which was provided by
56 the excavator and a record of the underground facility owners notified by the notification
57 center. If the notification center creates a record of the notice by telephonic recording, such
58 record of the original notice shall be maintained for one year from the date of receipt.
59 Records of notices to excavate maintained by the notification center in electronic form shall
60 bedeemedtoberecordsunderthissubsection. Personsholdingrecordsofnoticesofintentto
61 excavate and records of information provided to the excavator by the notification center or
62 owner or operator of the facility shall make copies of such records available for a reasonable
63 copying fee upon the request of the owner or operator of the underground facilities or the
64 excavator filing the notice.
65 [5.] 6. If in the course of excavation the person responsible for the excavation
66 operations discovers that the owner or operator of the underground facility who is a
67 participant in a notification center has incorrectly located the underground facility, or if the
68 discovery of an underground facility is not marked, he or she shall notify the notification
69 center which shall inform the underground facility owner. The underground facility owner
70 shallrespondtotheincorrectlocatenotificationwithintwohoursofreceiptofthenotification
71 by contacting the person responsible for the excavation or by correctly locating their
72 underground facility. The person responsible for maintaining records of the location of

74 the actual location of such facilities, if current records are incorrect.
75 [6.] 7. When markings have been provided in response to a notice of intent to
76 excavate, excavators may commence or continue to work within the area described in the
77 notice for so long as the markings are visible. If an excavator is unable to begin the
78 excavation within ten working days as described in the request, the excavator shall make a
79 relocate request before beginning the excavation. If markings become unusable due to
80 weather, construction or other cause, the excavator shall contact the notification center to
81 request remarking. Such notice shall be given in the same manner as original notice of intent
82 to excavate, and the owner or operator shall remark the site in the same manner, within the
83 same time, as required in response to an original notice of intent to excavate. Each excavator
84 shall exercise reasonable care not to unnecessarily disturb or obliterate markings provided for
85 location of underground facilities. If remarking is required due to the excavator's failure to
86 exercise reasonable care, or if repeated unnecessary requests for remarking are made by an
HB 2329 9
87 excavator even though the markings are visible and usable, the excavator may be liable to the
88 owner or operator for the reasonable cost of such remarking. Nothing in this section shall
89 allow any person other than the facility owner or their representative to mark or relocate any
90 underground facility.
91 [7.] 8. Before commencing excavation, the excavator shall determine best practices
92 for confirming the horizontal and vertical location of facilities at the site of excavation
93 considering conditions at the site including geology, access to the site, and the presence of
94 paved surfaces. Hand digging or soft digging shall be used as a best practice when possible.
95 [8.] 9. In the event of any damage, dislocation, or disturbance of any underground
96 facility in connection with any excavation, the person responsible for the excavation
97 operations shall notify the notification center. This subsection shall be deemed to require
98 reporting of any damage, dislocation, or disturbance to trace wires, encasements, cathode
99 protection, permanent above-ground stakes, or other such items utilized for protection of the
100 underground facility. The notification center shall promptly notify the owner of the
101 underground facility of such damage, dislocation, or disturbance. The excavator shall
102 immediatelycontact911 whenanydamageorcontactwithapipelineresultsina releasefrom
103 the pipeline of hazardous liquid or gas to occur.
104 10. The owner of the underground facility shall, within sixty days of the earlier
105 of receipt of notice as required under subsection 9 of this section or actual notice by
106 other means of an incident involving damage, dislocation, or disturbance of the
107 underground facility, submit a report of the incident to the notification center and the
108 excavator which includes the following:
109 (1) Adescriptionoftheincident,includingwhetheritresultedinrealorpersonal
110 property damage, personal injury, or death;
111 (2) A description of the damage to the underground facility;

116 If any of the information required in the incident report is not known or reasonably
117 available to the facility owner, such information shall be reported by the facility owner
118 tothenotificationcenterwithinsixtydaysofthesubmissionoftheinitialreport. Except
119 for information subject to protection by an individual privacy interest as determined by
120 the notification center, any information contained in the incident report shall be
121 available for public inquiry. The notification center shall maintain a database of
122 incident reports and each incident report shall be maintained by the notification center
123 for a minimum of five years. It shall be a continuing obligation of the underground
HB 2329 10
124 facility owner to submit incident reports when an incident occurs. If an underground
125 facility owner fails to timely submit an incident report in accordance with this
126 subsection, the owner shall be subject to a fine imposed by the attorney general under
127 the authority of section 319.045, not to exceed two hundred fifty dollars per day until
128 such incident report is filed and not to exceed five thousand dollars in the aggregate.
129 The filing of an incident report shall be a condition precedent to the right of a facility
130 owner to file and maintain a lawsuit for damages against an excavator as a result of a
131 violation of sections 319.015 to 319.050.
132 [9.] 11. In the event of any damage, dislocation, or disturbance to any underground
133 facility or any protective devices required to be reported by the excavator under subsection
134 [8] 9 of this section in advance of or during the excavation work, the person responsible for
135 theexcavationoperations shallnotconcealorattempt toconcealsuch damage,dislocation, or
136 disturbance, nor shall that person attempt to make repairs to the facility unless authorized by
137 the underground facility owner. In the case of sewer lines or facilities, emergency temporary
138 repairs may be made by the excavator after notification without the owners' or operators'
139 authorization to prevent further damage to the facilities. Such emergency repairs shall not
140 relieve the excavator of responsibility to make notification as required by subsection [8] 9 of
141 this section.
142 [10.] 12. No later than April [1, 2015, and] first of each year [thereafter], each
143 underground facility owner who owns or operates electric, gas, or pipeline facilities shall
144 submit to a central repository designated by the notification center a report of damages
145 experienced by its facilities for the prior calendar year. The notification center shall
146 determine the minimum information to be reported. All data submitted shall be aggregated
147 and anonymous. Information provided by the underground facility owner specific to damage
148 data submitted shall be accessible only to the underground facility owner unless otherwise
149 designated by the underground facility owner.
150 13. In the event of any damage, dislocation, or disturbance to any underground
151 facility or any protective devices required to be reported by the excavator under
152 subsection 9 of this section in advance of or during the excavation work, the person
153 responsible for the excavation operations shall report the occurrence through the
154 Damage Information Reporting Tool (DIRT) sponsored by the Common Ground
155 Alliance and in accordance with best practices.
319.027. 1. Any person may make design requests by contacting the notification
2 center. Such design requests shall include all information deemed necessary by the
3 notification center to complete the notice, including the identification of the person and a
4 description of the location of the project being designed and other information similar to that
5 required of excavators under section 319.026.

10 whom the notice will be transmitted and shall promptly transmit such notice to the
11 appropriate underground facility owners.
12 3. Every underground facility owner who receives a design request shall mark the
13 location of the facility, or contact the person making the request, within five working days
14 after the date the notice was received from the notification center. If the person making the
15 request was contacted as an alternative to marking location, the person and the underground
16 facility owner shall mutually agree on a schedule and method for providing the information,
17 provided that the facility shall be marked within five working days if the facility owner and
18 the person making the request are unable to agree.
19 4. No excavation may be commenced based upon information received through a
20 design request. Obtaining information through a design request shall not excuse any person
21 commencing an excavation from making notice and obtaining information under sections
22 319.025 and 319.026 concerning the possible location of any underground facilities which
23 may be affected.
319.030. 1. Every person owning or operating an underground facility to whom
2 notice of intent to excavate is required to be given shall, upon receipt of such notice as
3 provided in this section from a person intending to commence an excavation, inform the
4 excavator as promptly as practical, but not in excess of two working days, unless the
5 excavator agrees to extend the start date and time provided in the locate request through
6 methods established by the notification center, of the approximate location of underground
7 facilities in or near the area of the excavation so as to enable the person engaged in the
