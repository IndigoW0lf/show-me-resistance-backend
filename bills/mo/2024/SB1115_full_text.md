10 jurisdiction;
11 the governor may appoint a special prosecutor who shall

70 salaries of all employees hired by the special prosecutor
71 shall be set and determined by the special prosecutor but
72 shall be within the budget provided by the state.

8 impose other conditions relating to activities of the
9 child. If these additional conditions are not met, the
10 court may order the child detained as provided in section
11 211.151. If additional conditions are imposed, the child
12 shall be notified that failure to adhere to the conditions
13 may result in the court imposing more restrictive conditions
14 or ordering the detention of the child. If the person
15 taking the child into custody believes it desirable, he may

32 release shall be as provided in subsection 1 of this
33 section, and the detention shall be as provided in section
34 211.151. A written record of such conditional release or
35 detention shall be kept and a report in writing filed with

47 shall use a cumulative total of points assessed for all
48 alleged offenses committed to determine whether or not the
49 court shall order the child to be detained as provided in
50 section 211.151. The assessment shall be written on a
51 standardized form approved by the office of state courts
52 administrator.

38 dangerous felony as defined in section 556.061 and is
39 committed to the department of corrections shall be required
40 to serve the following minimum prison terms:

45 attains seventy years of age, and has served at least thirty
46 percent of the sentence imposed, whichever occurs first;

83 to, a felony offense other than those offenses listed in

85 no longer be subject to the minimum prison term provisions
86 under subsection 2 of this section, and shall be eligible
87 for parole, conditional release, or other early release by
88 the department of corrections according to the rules and
89 regulations of the department.

111 convicted of the same or similar offenses and with similar
112 criminal histories. The commission shall also study and
113 examine whether and to what extent sentencing disparity
114 among economic and social classes exists in relation to the
115 sentence of death and if so, the reasons therefor, if
116 sentences are comparable to other states, if the length of
117 the sentence is appropriate, and the rate of rehabilitation

121 penalty sentencing among economic and social classes.

135 (6) The circuit and associate circuit courts of this
136 state, the office of the state courts administrator, the
137 department of public safety, and the department of
138 corrections shall cooperate with the commission by providing
139 information or access to information needed by the
140 commission. The office of the state courts administrator
141 will provide needed staffing resources.
142 8. Courts shall retain discretion to lower or exceed
143 the sentence recommended by the commission as otherwise
144 allowable by law, and to order restorative justice methods,
145 when applicable.

147 suspended, the court may order any or all of the following
148 restorative justice methods, or any other method that the
