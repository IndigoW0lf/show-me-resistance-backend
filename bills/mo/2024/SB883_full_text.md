351 shall be interpreted to repeal or affect the validity of any
352 rule filed or adopted prior to August 28, 1999, if it fully
353 complied with the provisions of chapter 536. This section

356 review, to delay the effective date, or to disapprove and
357 annul a rule are subsequently held unconstitutional, then
358 the grant of rulemaking authority and any rule proposed or

81 section not to exceed a total of twenty-five thousand
82 dollars, unless a greater reasonable total is authorized by
83 the court upon a finding of good cause shown;
84 (b) May also be awarded other nonmonetary relief as
85 sought in the complaint including, but not limited to,
86 counseling, housing assistance, and personal financial
87 literacy assistance, as appropriate; and
88 (c) Shall be entitled to receive tuition assistance
89 under section 506.403.
90 6. (1) If, at the time of the judgment entry referred
91 to in subsection 5 of this section, the claimant has won a
92 monetary award against the state or any political
93 subdivision thereof in a civil action related to the same
94 subject, or has entered into a settlement agreement with the
95 state or any political subdivision thereof related to the
96 same subject, the amount of the award in the action or the
97 amount received in the settlement agreement, less any sums
98 paid to attorneys or for costs in litigating the other civil
99 action or obtaining the settlement agreement, shall be
100 deducted from the sum of moneys to which the claimant is
101 entitled under this section. The court shall include in the
102 judgment entry an award to the state of any amount deducted
103 under this subsection.
SB 883 16
104 (2) If subdivision (1) of this subsection does not
105 apply and if, after the time of the judgment entry referred
106 to in subsection 5 of this section, the claimant wins a
107 monetary award against the state or any political
108 subdivision thereof in a civil action related to the same
109 subject, or enters into a settlement agreement with the
110 state or any political subdivision thereof related to the
111 same subject, the claimant shall reimburse the state for the
112 sum of moneys paid under the judgment entry referred to in
113 subsection 5 of this section, less any sums paid to
114 attorneys or for costs in litigating the other civil action
115 or obtaining the settlement agreement. A reimbursement
116 required under this subsection shall not exceed the amount
117 of the monetary award the claimant wins for damages in the
118 other civil action or the amount received in the settlement
119 agreement.
120 7. If the court finds that the claimant is entitled to
121 a judgment, it shall enter a certificate of innocence
122 finding that the claimant was innocent of all offenses for
123 which the claimant was mistakenly convicted. The clerk of
124 the court shall send a certified copy of the certificate of
125 innocence and the judgment entry to the attorney general for
126 payment under section 105.711.
127 8. Upon entry of a certificate of innocence, the
128 claimant shall automatically be granted an order of
129 expungement from the court in which he or she pled guilty or
130 was sentenced to expunge from all official records or
131 recordations of his or her arrest, plea, trial, or
132 conviction. Upon granting of the order of expungement, the
133 records and files maintained in any administrative or court
134 proceeding in an associate or circuit division of the court
135 shall be confidential and only available to the parties or
SB 883 17
136 by order of the court for good cause shown. The effect of
137 such order shall be to restore such person to the status he
138 or she occupied prior to such arrest, plea, or conviction
139 and as if such event had never taken place. No person as to
140 whom such order has been entered shall be held thereafter
141 under any provision of any law to be guilty of perjury or
142 otherwise giving a false statement by reason of his or her
143 failure to recite or acknowledge such arrest, plea, trial,
144 conviction, or expungement in response to any inquiry made
145 of him or her for any purpose whatsoever, and no such
146 inquiry shall be made for information relating to an
147 expungement under this subsection.
148 9. Upon entry of a certificate of innocence, the court
149 shall order the expungement and destruction of the
150 associated biological samples authorized by and given to the
151 Missouri state highway patrol. The order shall state the
152 information required to be stated in a petition to expunge
153 and destroy the samples and profile record and shall direct
154 the Missouri state highway patrol to expunge and destroy
155 such samples and profile record. The clerk of the court
156 shall send a certified copy of the order to the Missouri
157 state highway patrol, which shall carry out the order and
158 provide confirmation of such action to the court. Nothing in
159 this subsection shall require the Missouri state highway
160 patrol to expunge and destroy any sample or profile record
161 associated with the claimant that was related to any offense
162 other than the offense for which the court has entered a
163 certificate of innocence.
164 10. The decision to grant or deny a certificate of
165 innocence shall not have a res judicata effect on any other
166 proceedings.
SB 883 18
167 11. Nothing in this section shall preclude the
168 department of corrections from providing reentry services to
169 a claimant that are provided to other persons including, but
170 not limited to, financial assistance, housing assistance,
171 mentoring, and counseling. Such services shall be provided
172 while an action under this section is pending and after any
173 judgment is entered, as appropriate for such claimant.
174 12. A decision under this section may be appealed to
175 the supreme court.
1 506.403. 1. Any individual awarded tuition assistance
2 under section 506.400 shall receive a waiver of tuition and
3 required fees for attendance at a public institution of
4 higher education for up to one hundred twenty credit hours.
5 Such individual may attend a public institution of higher
6 education either full-time or part-time.
7 2. (1) Subject to appropriations, the department of
8 higher education may make expenditures to reimburse each
9 individual awarded tuition assistance under section 506.400
10 who is enrolled in a public institution of higher education
11 for additional fees including, but not limited to, fees for
12 room and board, technical equipment, and course-required
13 books.
14 (2) No public institution of higher education shall
15 delay enrollment of an individual who is awarded tuition
16 assistance under section 506.400 because appropriations are
17 not available for any additional fees provided to such
18 individual.
19 3. To remain eligible for the tuition and fees waiver
20 under this section, an individual shall remain in good
21 standing at the public institution of higher education where
22 the individual is enrolled.
SB 883 19
23 4. Individuals shall provide a written or electronic
24 copy of the court order awarding relief in the form of
25 tuition assistance to the public institution of higher
26 education or the department of higher education.
27 5. The department of higher education shall adopt
28 rules and regulations to administer the provisions of this
29 section. Any rule or portion of a rule, as that term is
30 defined in section 536.010, that is created under the
31 authority delegated in this section shall become effective
32 only if it complies with and is subject to all of the
33 provisions of chapter 536 and, if applicable, section
34 536.028. This section and chapter 536 are nonseverable, and
35 if any of the powers vested with the general assembly
36 pursuant to chapter 536 to review, to delay the effective
37 date, or to disapprove and annul a rule are subsequently
38 held unconstitutional, then the grant of rulemaking
39 authority and any rule proposed or adopted after August 28,
40 2024, shall be invalid and void.
1 [650.058. 1. Notwithstanding the
2 sovereign immunity of the state, any individual
3 who was found guilty of a felony in a Missouri
4 court and was later determined to be actually
5 innocent of such crime solely as a result of DNA
6 profiling analysis may be paid restitution. The
7 individual may receive an amount of one hundred
8 dollars per day for each day of postconviction
9 incarceration for the crime for which the
10 individual is determined to be actually
11 innocent. The petition for the payment of said
12 restitution shall be filed with the sentencing
13 court. For the purposes of this section, the
14 term "actually innocent" shall mean:
15 (1) The individual was convicted of a
16 felony for which a final order of release was
17 entered by the court;
18 (2) All appeals of the order of release
19 have been exhausted;
20 (3) The individual was not serving any
21 term of a sentence for any other crime
22 concurrently with the sentence for which he or
23 she is determined to be actually innocent,
24 unless such individual was serving another
SB 883 20
25 concurrent sentence because his or her parole
26 was revoked by a court or the parole board in
27 connection with the crime for which the person
28 has been exonerated. Regardless of whether any
29 other basis may exist for the revocation of the
30 person's probation or parole at the time of
31 conviction for the crime for which the person is
32 later determined to be actually innocent, when
33 the court's or the parole board's sole stated
34 reason for the revocation in its order is the
35 conviction for the crime for which the person is
36 later determined to be actually innocent, such
37 order shall, for purposes of this section only,
38 be conclusive evidence that their probation or
39 parole was revoked in connection with the crime
40 for which the person has been exonerated; and
41 (4) Testing ordered under section 547.035,
42 or testing by the order of any state or federal
43 court, if such person was exonerated on or
44 before August 28, 2004, or testing ordered under
45 section 650.055, if such person was or is
46 exonerated after August 28, 2004, demonstrates a
47 person's innocence of the crime for which the
48 person is in custody.
49 Any individual who receives restitution under
50 this section shall be prohibited from seeking
51 any civil redress from the state, its
52 departments and agencies, or any employee
53 thereof, or any political subdivision or its
54 employees. This section shall not be construed
55 as a waiver of sovereign immunity for any
56 purposes other than the restitution provided for
57 herein. The department of corrections shall
58 determine the aggregate amount of restitution
59 owed during a fiscal year. If insufficient
60 moneys are appropriated each fiscal year to pay
61 restitution to such persons, the department
62 shall pay each individual who has received an
63 order awarding restitution a pro rata share of
64 the amount appropriated. Provided sufficient
65 moneys are appropriated to the department, the
66 amounts owed to such individual shall be paid on
67 June thirtieth of each subsequent fiscal year,
68 until such time as the restitution to the
69 individual has been paid in full. However, no
70 individual awarded restitution under this
71 subsection shall receive more than thirty-six
72 thousand five hundred dollars during each fiscal
73 year. No interest on unpaid restitution shall
74 be awarded to the individual. No individual who
75 has been determined by the court to be actually
76 innocent shall be responsible for the costs of
77 care under section 217.831.
78 2. If the results of the DNA testing
79 confirm the person's guilt, then the person
80 filing for DNA testing under section 547.035,
81 shall:
SB 883 21
82 (1) Be liable for any reasonable costs
83 incurred when conducting the DNA test, including
84 but not limited to the cost of the test. Such
85 costs shall be determined by the court and shall
86 be included in the findings of fact and
87 conclusions of law made by the court; and
88 (2) Be sanctioned under the provisions of
89 section 217.262.
90 3. A petition for payment of restitution
91 under this section may only be filed by the
92 individual determined to be actually innocent or
93 the individual's legal guardian. No claim or
94 petition for restitution under this section may
95 be filed by the individual's heirs or assigns.
96 An individual's right to receive restitution
97 under this section is not assignable or
98 otherwise transferrable. The state's obligation
99 to pay restitution under this section shall
100 cease upon the individual's death. Any
101 beneficiary designation that purports to
102 bequeath, assign, or otherwise convey the right
103 to receive such restitution shall be void and
104 unenforceable.
105 4. An individual who is determined to be
106 actually innocent of a crime under this chapter
107 shall automatically be granted an order of
108 expungement from the court in which he or she
109 pled guilty or was sentenced to expunge from all
110 official records all recordations of his or her
111 arrest, plea, trial or conviction. Upon
112 granting of the order of expungement, the
113 records and files maintained in any
114 administrative or court proceeding in an
115 associate or circuit division of the court shall
116 be confidential and only available to the
117 parties or by order of the court for good cause
118 shown. The effect of such order shall be to
119 restore such person to the status he or she
120 occupied prior to such arrest, plea or
121 conviction and as if such event had never taken
122 place. No person as to whom such order has been
123 entered shall be held thereafter under any
124 provision of any law to be guilty of perjury or
125 otherwise giving a false statement by reason of
126 his or her failure to recite or acknowledge such
127 arrest, plea, trial, conviction or expungement
128 in response to any inquiry made of him or her
129 for any purpose whatsoever and no such inquiry
130 shall be made for information relating to an
131 expungement under this section.]
