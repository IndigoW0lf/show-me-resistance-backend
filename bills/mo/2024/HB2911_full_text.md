6 being used regularly for [prostitution activity] commercial sexual exploitation, the court
7 may order that the premises shall not be occupied or used for such period as the court may
8 determine, not to exceed one year.
9 3. All persons, including owners, lessees, officers, agents, inmates or employees,
10 aiding or facilitating such a nuisance may be made defendants in any suit to enjoin the
11 nuisance, and they may be enjoined from engaging in [any prostitution activity] commercial
12 sexual exploitation anywhere within the jurisdiction of the court.
13 4. Appeals shall be allowed from the judgment of the court as in other civil actions.
573.503. Notwithstanding any provision of law to the contrary, any city not within a
2 county and any county may, by order or ordinance, require a background check be conducted
3 on all employees of any adult cabaret to ascertain whether any such employees have been
4 convicted of or have pled guilty to any misdemeanor or felony involving prostitution as it
5 existed prior to August 28, 2024, or aiding or abetting prostitution as it existed prior to
6 August 28, 2024, commercial sexual exploitation, drug possession or trafficking, money
7 laundering, tax evasion, or illegal gambling activity.
573.525. 1. It is the purpose of sections 573.525 to 573.537 to regulate sexually
2 oriented businesses in order to promote the health, safety, and general welfare of the citizens
3 of this state, and to establish reasonable and uniform regulations to prevent the deleterious
4 secondary effects of sexually oriented businesses within the state. The provisions of sections
5 573.525 to 573.537 have neither the purpose nor effect of imposing a limitation or restriction
6 on the content or reasonable access to any communicative materials, including sexually
7 oriented materials. Similarly, it is neither the intent nor effect of sections 573.525 to 573.537
8 to restrict or deny access by adults to sexually oriented materials protected by the first
9 amendment, or to deny access by the distributors and exhibitors of sexually oriented
10 entertainment to their intended market. Neither is it the intent nor effect of sections 573.525
11 to 573.537 to condone or legitimize the distribution of obscene material.
12 2. The general assembly finds that:
13 (1) Sexually oriented businesses, as a category of commercial enterprises, are
14 associated with a wide variety of adverse secondary effects, including but not limited to
15 personal and property crimes, [prostitution,] commercial sexual exploitation, potential
16 spread of disease, lewdness, public indecency, obscenity, illicit drug use and drug trafficking,
HB 2911 32
17 negative impacts on surrounding properties, urban blight, litter, and sexual assault and
18 exploitation;
19 (2) Sexually oriented businesses should be separated from sensitive land uses to
20 minimize the impact of their secondary effects upon such uses, and should be separated from
21 other sexually oriented businesses, to minimize the secondary effects associated with such
22 uses and to prevent an unnecessary concentration of sexually oriented businesses in one area;
23 (3) Each of the foregoing negative secondary effects constitutes a harm which the
24 state has a substantial interest in preventing or abating, or both. Such substantial government
25 interest in preventing secondary effects, which is the state's rationale for sections 573.525 to
26 573.537, exists independent of any comparative analysis between sexually oriented and
27 nonsexually oriented businesses. Additionally, the state's interest in regulating sexually
28 oriented businesses extends to preventing future secondary effects of current or future
29 sexually oriented businesses that may locate in the state.
573.531. 1. No person shall establish a sexually oriented business within one
2 thousand feet of any preexisting primary or secondary school, house of worship, state-
3 licensed day care facility, public library, public park, residence, or other sexually oriented
4 business. This subsection shall not apply to any sexually oriented business lawfully
5 established prior to August 28, 2010. For purposes of this subsection, measurements shall be
6 made in a straight line, without regard to intervening structures or objects, from the closest
7 portion of the parcel containing the sexually oriented business to the closest portion of the
8 parcel containing the preexisting primary or secondary school, house of worship, state-
9 licensed day care facility, public library, public park, residence, or other sexually oriented
10 business.
11 2. No person shall establish a sexually oriented business if a person with an
12 influential interest in the sexually oriented business has been found guilty of any of the
13 following specified offenses for which less than eight years has elapsed since the date of
14 conviction or the date of release from confinement for the conviction, whichever is later:
15 (1) Rape and sexual assault offenses;
16 (2) Sexual offenses involving minors;
17 (3) Offenses involving prostitution as it existed prior to August 28, 2024, or
18 commercial sexual exploitation;
19 (4) Obscenity offenses;
20 (5) Offenses involving money laundering;
21 (6) Offenses involving tax evasion;
22 (7) Any attempt, solicitation, or conspiracy to commit one of the offenses listed in
23 subdivisions (1) to (6) of this subsection; or
HB 2911 33
24 (8) Any offense committed in another jurisdiction which if committed in this state

27 in a state of nudity.

43 (2) An operator's station shall not exceed thirty-two square feet of floor area;
44 (3) If the premises has two or more operator's stations designated, the interior of the
45 premises shall be configured in such a manner that there is an unobstructed view of each area
46 of the premises to which any patron is permitted access for any purpose from at least one of
47 the operator's stations;
48 (4) The view required under this subsection shall be by direct line of sight from the
49 operator's station;
50 (5) It is the duty of the operator to ensure that at least one employee is on duty and
51 situated in an operator's station at all times that any patron is on the portion of the premises
52 monitored by such operator station; and
53 (6) It shall be the duty of the operator and of any employees present on the premises
54 to ensure that the view area specified in this subsection remains unobstructed by any doors,
55 curtains, walls, merchandise, display racks, or other materials or enclosures at all times that
56 any patron is present on the premises.
57 7. Sexually oriented businesses that do not have stages or interior configurations
58 which meet at least the minimum requirements of sections 573.525 to 573.537 shall be given
59 one hundred eighty days after August 28, 2010, to comply with the stage and building
60 requirements of sections 573.525 to 573.537. During such one hundred eighty-day period,
