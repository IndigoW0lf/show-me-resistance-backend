149 this section, provided that it shall not serve as an alternative to an national instant criminal
150 background check required by 18 U.S.C. Section 922(t). The provisional permit shall remain

158 6. The sheriff may refuse to approve an application for a concealed carry permit if he
159 or she determines that any of the requirements specified in subsection 2 of this section have

HB 2806 11
161 applicant has rendered a false statement regarding any of the provisions of sections 571.101
162 to 571.121. If the applicant is found to be ineligible, the sheriff is required to deny the
163 application, and notify the applicant in writing, stating the grounds for denial and informing
164 the applicant of the right to submit, within thirty days, any additional documentation relating
165 to the grounds of the denial. Upon receiving any additional documentation, the sheriff shall
166 reconsider his or her decision and inform the applicant within thirty days of the result of the
167 reconsideration. The applicant shall further be informed in writing of the right to appeal the
168 denial pursuant to subsections 2, 3, 4, and 5 of section 571.114. After two additional reviews
169 and denials by the sheriff, the person submitting the application shall appeal the denial
170 pursuant to subsections 2, 3, 4, and 5 of section 571.114.
