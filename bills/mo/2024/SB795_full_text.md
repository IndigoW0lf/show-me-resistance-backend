101 7. For all fiscal years ending on or before June 30,

106 social services, the cumulative amount of tax credits are
107 equally apportioned among all facilities classified as
108 shelters for victims of domestic violence and rape crisis
109 centers. If a shelter for victims of domestic violence or
110 rape crisis center fails to use all, or some percentage to
111 be determined by the director of the department of social
112 services, of its apportioned tax credits during this
113 predetermined period of time, the director of the department
SB 795 5
114 of social services may reapportion these unused tax credits
115 to those shelters for victims of domestic violence and rape
116 crisis centers that have used all, or some percentage to be
117 determined by the director of the department of social
118 services, of their apportioned tax credits during this
119 predetermined period of time. The director of the
120 department of social services may establish more than one
121 period of time and reapportion more than once during each
122 fiscal year. To the maximum extent possible, the director
123 of the department of social services shall establish the
124 procedure described in this subsection in such a manner as
125 to ensure that taxpayers can claim all the tax credits
126 possible up to the cumulative amount of tax credits
127 available for the fiscal year.
128 8. This section shall become effective January 1,
129 2000, and shall apply to all tax years after December 31,
130 1999.
131 9. For all tax years beginning on or after January 1,
132 2025, in addition to all other tax credits authorized under
133 this section, a taxpayer shall be allowed to claim a credit
134 against the taxpayer's state tax liability in an amount
135 equal to one thousand dollars if such taxpayer has converted
136 abandoned property, as such term is defined under section
137 447.700, into an operational shelter for victims of domestic
138 violence in the tax year for which the credit is sought.
139 10. For all tax years beginning on or after January 1,
140 2025, in addition to all other tax credits authorized under
141 this section, a taxpayer shall be allowed to claim a credit
142 against the taxpayer's state tax liability in an amount
143 equal to five hundred dollars if the taxpayer has rented
144 residential real estate to a victim of domestic violence, as
SB 795 6
145 such term is defined under section 455.010, in the tax year
146 for which the credit is sought.
147 11. The department of social services and the
148 department of revenue may jointly promulgate all necessary
149 rules and regulations for the administration of subsections
150 9 and 10 of this section. Any rule or portion of a rule, as
151 that term is defined in section 536.010, that is created
152 under the authority delegated in this section shall become
153 effective only if it complies with and is subject to all of
154 the provisions of chapter 536 and, if applicable, section
155 536.028. This section and chapter 536 are nonseverable, and
156 if any of the powers vested with the general assembly
157 pursuant to chapter 536 to review, to delay the effective
158 date, or to disapprove and annul a rule are subsequently
159 held unconstitutional, then the grant of rulemaking
160 authority and any rule proposed or adopted after August 28,
161 2024, shall be invalid and void.
