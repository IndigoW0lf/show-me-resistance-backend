61 suitable evidence of payment of the annual or biennial fee,
62 and such evidence of payment shall be carried at all times
63 in the vehicle for which it is issued.
64 5. The director shall make all necessary rules and
65 regulations for the administration of this section and shall
66 design all necessary forms required by this section. Any
67 rule or portion of a rule, as that term is defined in
68 section 536.010, that is created under the authority
69 delegated in this section shall become effective only if it
70 complies with and is subject to all the provisions of
71 chapter 536 and, if applicable, section 536.028. This
72 section and chapter 536 are nonseverable, and if any of the
73 powers vested with the general assembly under chapter 536 to
74 review, to delay the effective date, or to disapprove and
75 annul a rule are subsequently held unconstitutional, then
76 the grant of rulemaking authority and any rule proposed or
77 adopted after August 28, 2024, shall be invalid and void.
