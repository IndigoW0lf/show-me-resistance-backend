102ND GENERA L ASSEMBLY
INTRODUCED BY SENATOR MCCREERY.
4772S.01I KRISTINA MARTIN, Secretary
AN ACT
To repeal section 197.135, RSMo, and to enact in lieu thereof one new section relating to forensic
examinations of victims of sexual offenses.
Be it enacted by the General Assembly of the State of Missouri, as follows:
1 Section A. Section 197.135, RSMo, is repealed and one new
2 section enacted in lieu thereof, to be known as section 197.135,
3 to read as follows:
1 197.135. 1. Beginning January 1, 2023, or no later
2 than six months after the establishment of the statewide
3 telehealth network under section 192.2520, whichever is
4 later, any hospital licensed under this chapter shall
5 perform a forensic examination using an evidentiary
6 collection kit upon the request and consent of the victim of
7 a sexual offense, or the victim's guardian, when the victim
8 is at least fourteen years of age. In the case of minor
9 consent, the provisions of subsection 2 of section 595.220
10 shall apply. Victims under fourteen years of age shall be
11 referred, and victims fourteen years of age or older but
12 less than eighteen years of age may be referred, to a SAFE
13 CARE provider, as such term is defined in section 334.950,
14 for medical or forensic evaluation and case review. Nothing
15 in this section shall be interpreted to preclude a hospital
16 from performing a forensic examination for a victim under
17 fourteen years of age upon the request and consent of the
18 victim or victim's guardian, subject to the provisions of
SB 1326 2
19 section 595.220 and the rules promulgated by the department
20 of public safety.
21 2. (1) An appropriate medical provider, as such term
22 is defined in section 595.220, shall perform the forensic
23 examination of a victim of a sexual offense. The hospital
24 shall ensure that any provider performing the examination
25 has received training conducting such examinations that is,
26 at a minimum, equivalent to the training offered by the
27 statewide telehealth network under subsection 4 of section
28 192.2520. Nothing in this section shall require providers
29 to utilize the training offered by the statewide telehealth
30 network, as long as the training utilized is, at a minimum,
31 equivalent to the training offered by the statewide
32 telehealth network.
33 (2) If the provider is not a sexual assault nurse
34 examiner (SANE), or another similarly trained physician or
35 nurse, then the hospital shall utilize telehealth services
36 during the examination, such as those provided by the
37 statewide telehealth network, to provide guidance and
38 support through a SANE, or other similarly trained physician
39 or nurse, who may observe the live forensic examination and
40 who shall communicate with and support the onsite provider
41 with the examination, forensic evidence collection, and
42 proper transmission and storage of the examination evidence.
43 3. The department of health and senior services may
44 issue a waiver of the telehealth requirements of subsection
45 2 of this section if the hospital demonstrates to the
46 department, in writing, a technological hardship in
47 accessing telehealth services or a lack of access to
48 adequate broadband services sufficient to access telehealth
49 services. Such waivers shall be granted sparingly and for
SB 1326 3
50 no more than a year in length at a time, with the
51 opportunity for renewal at the department's discretion.
52 4. The department shall waive the requirements of this
53 section if the statewide telehealth network established
54 under section 192.2520 ceases operation, the director of the
55 department of health and senior services has provided
56 written notice to hospitals licensed under this chapter that
57 the network has ceased operation, and the hospital cannot,
58 in good faith, comply with the requirements of this section
59 without assistance or resources of the statewide telehealth
60 network. Such waiver shall remain in effect until such time
61 as the statewide telehealth network resumes operation or
62 until the hospital is able to demonstrate compliance with
63 the provisions of this section without the assistance or
64 resources of the statewide telehealth network.
65 5. The provisions of section 595.220 shall apply to
66 the reimbursement of the reasonable costs of the
67 examinations and the provision of the evidentiary collection
68 kits.
69 6. No individual hospital shall be required to comply
70 with the provisions of this section and section 192.2520
71 unless and until the department provides such hospital with
72 access to the statewide telehealth network for the purposes
73 of mentoring and training services required under section
74 192.2520 without charge to the hospital.
75 7. A specialty hospital shall be considered exempt
76 from the provisions of this section and section 192.2520 if
77 such hospital has a policy for the transfer of a victim of a
78 sexual offense to an appropriate hospital with an emergency
79 department. As used in this section, "specialty hospital"
80 shall mean a hospital licensed under this chapter and
SB 1326 4
81 designated by the department as something other than a
82 general acute care hospital.
