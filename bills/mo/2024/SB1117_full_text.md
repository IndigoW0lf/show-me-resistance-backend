SB 1117 2
13 resulting from the use of firearms that are stored in
14 compliance with this section.
1 563.031. 1. A person may, subject to the provisions
2 of subsection 2 of this section, use physical force upon
3 another person when and to the extent he or she reasonably
4 believes such force to be necessary to defend himself or
5 herself or a third person from what he or she reasonably
6 believes to be the use or imminent use of unlawful force by
7 such other person, unless:
8 (1) The actor was the initial aggressor; except that
9 in such case his or her use of force is nevertheless
10 justifiable provided:
11 (a) He or she has withdrawn from the encounter and
12 effectively communicated such withdrawal to such other
13 person but the latter persists in continuing the incident by
14 the use or threatened use of unlawful force; or
15 (b) He or she is a law enforcement officer and as such
16 is an aggressor pursuant to section 563.046; or
17 (c) The aggressor is justified under some other
18 provision of this chapter or other provision of law;
19 (2) Under the circumstances as the actor reasonably
20 believes them to be, the person whom he or she seeks to
21 protect would not be justified in using such protective
22 force;
23 (3) The actor was attempting to commit, committing, or
24 escaping after the commission of a forcible felony.
25 2. A person shall not use deadly force upon another
26 person under the circumstances specified in subsection 1 of
27 this section unless:
28 (1) He or she reasonably believes that such deadly
29 force is necessary to protect himself, or herself or her
SB 1117 3
30 unborn child, or another against death, serious physical
31 injury, or any forcible felony;
32 (2) Such force is used against a person who unlawfully
33 enters, remains after unlawfully entering, or attempts to
34 unlawfully enter a dwelling, residence, place of employment,
35 or vehicle lawfully occupied by such person; or
36 (3) Such force is used against a person who unlawfully
37 enters, remains after unlawfully entering, or attempts to
38 unlawfully enter private property that is owned or leased by
39 an individual, or is occupied by an individual who has been
40 given specific authority by the property owner to occupy the
41 property, or is a retail establishment or other place of
42 business wherein an individual using such force has a right
43 to be, claiming a justification of using protective force
44 under this section.
45 3. A person does not have a duty to retreat:
46 (1) From a dwelling, residence, place of employment,
47 or vehicle where the person is not unlawfully entering or
48 unlawfully remaining;
49 (2) From private property that is owned or leased by
50 such individual; or
51 (3) If the person is in any other location such person
52 has the right to be.
53 4. The justification afforded by this section extends
54 to the use of physical restraint as protective force
55 provided that the actor takes all reasonable measures to
56 terminate the restraint as soon as it is reasonable to do so.
57 5. [The defendant shall have the burden of injecting
58 the issue of justification under this section. If a
59 defendant asserts that his or her use of force is described
60 under subdivision (2) of subsection 2 of this section, the
61 burden shall then be on the state to prove beyond a
SB 1117 4
62 reasonable doubt that the defendant did not reasonably
63 believe that the use of such force was necessary to defend
64 against what he or she reasonably believed was the use or
65 imminent use of unlawful force] There shall be a presumption
66 of reasonableness under this section that the defendant
67 believed such force was necessary to defend himself or
68 herself or a third person from what he or she believed to be
69 the use or imminent use of unlawful force by another person.
1 563.085. 1. A person who uses or threatens to use
2 force pursuant to section 563.031 is justified in such
3 conduct and is immune from criminal prosecution and civil
4 action for the use or threatened use of such force by the
5 person, personal representative, or heirs of the person
6 against whom the force was used or threatened, unless the
7 person against whom force was used or threatened is a law
8 enforcement officer who was acting in the performance of his
9 or her official duties and the officer identified himself or
10 herself in accordance with any applicable law or the person
11 using or threatening to use force knew or reasonably should
12 have known that the person was a law enforcement officer.
13 As used in this subsection, the term "criminal prosecution"
14 includes arresting, detaining in custody, and charging or
15 prosecuting the defendant.
16 2. A law enforcement agency may use standard
17 procedures for investigating the use or threatened use of
18 force as described in subsection 1 of this section, but the
19 agency may not arrest the person for using or threatening to
20 use force unless the agency determines that there is
21 probable cause that the force that was used or threatened
22 was unlawful.
23 3. In a criminal prosecution or civil action, once a
24 prima facie claim of self-defense immunity has been raised
SB 1117 5
25 by the defendant at a pretrial immunity hearing, the burden
26 of proof by clear and convincing evidence is on the party
27 seeking to overcome the immunity provided in subsection 1 of
28 this section.

51 policy enacted by a political subdivision or the state
52 contracting with such business entity; and
53 (4) The business's prohibition of carrying firearms or
54 other arms was the proximate cause of the damages, loss, or
55 injury suffered by the plaintiff.
56 5. If a plaintiff prevails in an action brought under
57 this section, the plaintiff shall be entitled to actual
58 damages sustained as a result of the failure of the business

60 be entitled to recover reasonable attorney's fees, expert
61 witness costs, and court costs.

73 agent thereof, acted purposely, in committing or assisting
74 in committing the act that caused such injury.

6 shall issue a concealed carry permit authorizing the
7 carrying of a concealed firearm on or about the applicant's
8 person or within a vehicle. A concealed carry permit shall
9 be valid from the date of issuance or renewal until five
10 years from the last day of the month in which the permit was
11 issued or renewed, unless the permit expires during a

175 subsection 2 of this section. In addition to the completed

SB 1117 29
178 (1) A photocopy of a firearms safety training
179 certificate of completion or other evidence of completion of
180 a firearms safety training course that meets the standards
181 established in subsection 1 or 2 of section 571.111; and
182 (2) A nonrefundable permit fee as provided by
183 subsection 11 or 12 of this section.
184 5. (1) Before an application for a concealed carry
185 permit is approved, the sheriff shall make only such
186 inquiries as he or she deems necessary into the accuracy of
187 the statements made in the application. The sheriff may
188 require that the applicant display a Missouri driver's
189 license or nondriver's license or military identification
190 and orders showing the person being stationed in Missouri.
191 In order to determine the applicant's suitability for a
192 concealed carry permit, the applicant shall be
193 fingerprinted. No other biometric data shall be collected
194 from the applicant. The sheriff shall conduct an inquiry of
195 the National Instant Criminal Background Check System within
196 three working days after submission of the properly
197 completed application for a concealed carry permit. If no
198 disqualifying record is identified by these checks at the
199 state level, the fingerprints shall be forwarded to the
200 Federal Bureau of Investigation for a national criminal
201 history record check. Upon receipt of the completed report
202 from the National Instant Criminal Background Check System
203 and the response from the Federal Bureau of Investigation
204 national criminal history record check, the sheriff shall
205 examine the results and, if no disqualifying information is
206 identified, shall issue a concealed carry permit within
207 three working days.
208 (2) In the event the report from the National Instant
209 Criminal Background Check System and the response from the
SB 1117 30
210 Federal Bureau of Investigation national criminal history
211 record check prescribed by subdivision (1) of this
212 subsection are not completed within forty-five calendar days
213 and no disqualifying information concerning the applicant
214 has otherwise come to the sheriff's attention, the sheriff
215 shall issue a provisional permit, clearly designated on the
216 certificate as such, which the applicant shall sign in the
217 presence of the sheriff or the sheriff's designee. This
218 permit, when carried with a valid Missouri driver's or
219 nondriver's license or a valid military identification,
220 shall permit the applicant to exercise the same rights in
221 accordance with the same conditions as pertain to a
222 concealed carry permit issued under this section, provided
223 that it shall not serve as an alternative to an national
224 instant criminal background check required by 18 U.S.C.
225 Section 922(t). The provisional permit shall remain valid
226 until such time as the sheriff either issues or denies the
227 certificate of qualification under subsection 6 or 7 of this
228 section. The sheriff shall revoke a provisional permit
229 issued under this subsection within twenty-four hours of
230 receipt of any report that identifies a disqualifying
231 record, and shall notify the concealed carry permit system
232 established under subsection 5 of section 650.350. The
233 revocation of a provisional permit issued under this section
234 shall be proscribed in a manner consistent to the denial and
235 review of an application under subsection 6 of this section.
236 6. The sheriff may refuse to approve an application
237 for a concealed carry permit if he or she determines that
238 any of the requirements specified in subsection 2 of this
239 section have not been met, or if he or she has a substantial
240 and demonstrable reason to believe that the applicant has
241 rendered a false statement regarding any of the provisions
SB 1117 31
242 of sections 571.101 to 571.121. If the applicant is found
243 to be ineligible, the sheriff is required to deny the
244 application, and notify the applicant in writing, stating
245 the grounds for denial and informing the applicant of the
246 right to submit, within thirty days, any additional
247 documentation relating to the grounds of the denial. Upon
248 receiving any additional documentation, the sheriff shall
249 reconsider his or her decision and inform the applicant
250 within thirty days of the result of the reconsideration.
251 The applicant shall further be informed in writing of the
252 right to appeal the denial pursuant to subsections 2, 3, 4,
253 and 5 of section 571.114. After two additional reviews and
254 denials by the sheriff, the person submitting the
255 application shall appeal the denial pursuant to subsections
256 2, 3, 4, and 5 of section 571.114.
257 7. If the application is approved, the sheriff shall
258 issue a concealed carry permit to the applicant within a
259 period not to exceed three working days after his or her
260 approval of the application. The applicant shall sign the
261 concealed carry permit in the presence of the sheriff or his
262 or her designee.

62 of the notice from the court. The director of revenue shall
63 notify the licensee that he or she must apply for a new
64 license pursuant to chapter 302 which does not contain such
65 endorsement. This requirement does not affect the driving
66 privileges of the licensee. The notice issued by the
67 department of revenue shall be mailed to the last known
68 address shown on the individual's driving record. The
69 notice is deemed received three days after mailing.

78 (1) When a valid full order of protection or any
79 arrest warrant, discharge, or commitment for the reasons
80 listed in subdivision (3), (4), (5), (8), or (11) of
81 subsection 2 of section 571.101 is issued against a person
82 holding a concealed carry permit, upon notification of said
83 order, warrant, discharge, or commitment or upon an order of
84 a court of competent jurisdiction in a criminal proceeding,
85 a commitment proceeding, or a full order of protection
SB 1117 37
86 proceeding ruling that a person holding a concealed carry
87 permit presents a risk of harm to themselves or others, then

111 issuing county sheriff [of the county of the applicant's
112 residence]. The renewal application shall contain the same
113 required information as set forth in subsection 3 of section
114 571.101, except that in lieu of the fingerprint requirement
115 of subsection 5 of section 571.101 and the firearms safety
116 training, the applicant need only display his or her current
117 concealed carry permit. A name-based inquiry of the
SB 1117 38
118 National Instant Criminal Background Check System shall be
119 completed for each renewal application. The sheriff shall
120 review the results of the report from the National Instant
121 Criminal Background Check System, and when the sheriff has
122 determined the applicant has successfully completed all
123 renewal requirements and is not disqualified under any
124 provision of section 571.101, the sheriff shall issue a new
125 concealed carry permit which contains the date such permit
126 was renewed. The process for renewing a concealed carry
127 endorsement issued prior to August 28, 2013, shall be the

141 fee of ten dollars per month for each month it is expired
142 for up to six months. After six months, the sheriff who
143 issued the expired concealed carry permit or certificate of
144 qualification shall notify the concealed carry permit system
145 that such permit is expired and cancelled. If the person
146 has a concealed carry endorsement issued prior to August 28,
147 2013, the sheriff who issued the certificate of
148 qualification for the endorsement shall notify the director
149 of revenue that such certificate is expired regardless of
SB 1117 39
150 whether the endorsement holder has applied for a concealed
151 carry permit under subsection 3 of this section. The
152 director of revenue shall immediately remove such
153 endorsement from the individual's driving record and notify
154 the individual that his or her driver's license or
155 nondriver's license has expired. The notice shall be

171 new jurisdiction that the permit or endorsement holder has
172 changed his or her residence. The sheriff in the new
173 jurisdiction shall notify the sheriff in the old
174 jurisdiction of the permit holder's change of address and
175 the sheriff in the old jurisdiction shall transfer any
176 information on file for the permit holder to the sheriff in
177 the new jurisdiction within thirty days. The sheriff of the

180 of a change in residence. The sheriff shall report the
181 residence change to the concealed carry permit system, take
SB 1117 40
182 possession and destroy the old permit, and then issue a new
183 permit to the permit holder. The new address shall be
184 accessible by the concealed carry permit system within three
185 days of receipt of the information. If the person has a
186 concealed carry endorsement issued prior to August 28, 2013,
187 the endorsement holder shall also furnish proof to the
188 department of revenue of his or her residence change. In
189 such cases, the change of residence shall be made by the

196 within seven days after actual knowledge of the loss or

199 endorsement. The permit or endorsement holder shall furnish
200 a statement to the sheriff that the permit or driver's
201 license or nondriver's license containing the concealed
202 carry endorsement has been lost or destroyed. After
203 notification of the loss or destruction of a permit or
204 driver's license or nondriver's license containing a
205 concealed carry endorsement, the sheriff may charge a
206 processing fee of ten dollars for costs associated with

225 permit. The permit or endorsement holder shall furnish
226 proof of the name change to the sheriff within thirty days
227 of changing his or her name and display his or her concealed
228 carry permit or current driver's license or nondriver's
229 license containing a concealed carry endorsement. The

231 permit system, and the new name shall be accessible by the
232 concealed carry permit system within three days of receipt
233 of the information.
234 [8.] 7. The person with a concealed carry permit, or
235 endorsement issued prior to August 28, 2013, shall notify
236 the sheriff of a name [or address change] within thirty days
237 of the change. A concealed carry permit and, if applicable,
238 endorsement shall be automatically invalid after one hundred
239 eighty days if the permit or endorsement holder has changed
240 his or her name or changed his or her residence and not
241 notified the sheriff as required in subsections 5 and 7 of
242 this section. The sheriff shall assess a late penalty of
243 ten dollars per month for each month, up to six months and

255 member, the permit shall be renewed if the person completes
256 the renewal requirements under subsection 3 of this section
257 within two months of returning to Missouri after discharge
258 from such duty or recovery from such incapacitation. Once
259 the two-month period has expired, the provisions of
260 subsection 4 of this section shall apply except the
261 penalties shall begin to accrue upon the expiration of the
262 two-month period described in this subsection rather than on
263 the expiration date of the permit or endorsement.

SB 1117 43
276 costs associated with mailing the permit, but the costs

229 or if he or she has a substantial and demonstrable reason to
230 believe that the applicant has rendered a false statement
231 regarding any of the provisions of sections 571.205 to
232 571.230. If the applicant is found to be ineligible, the
233 sheriff is required to deny the application, and notify the
234 applicant in writing, stating the grounds for denial and
235 informing the applicant of the right to submit, within
236 thirty days, any additional documentation relating to the
237 grounds of the denial. Upon receiving any additional
238 documentation, the sheriff shall reconsider his or her
239 decision and inform the applicant within thirty days of the
240 result of the reconsideration. The applicant shall further
241 be informed in writing of the right to appeal the denial
242 under section 571.220. After two additional reviews and
243 denials by the sheriff, the person submitting the
244 application shall appeal the denial under section 571.220.

279 information on any driver's or nondriver's license shall
280 have the same personal protection for purposes of sections

282 Missouri lifetime or extended concealed carry permit or
283 provisional permit shall not be public information and shall
284 be considered personal protected information. Information
285 retained in the concealed carry permit system under this
286 subsection shall not be distributed to any federal, state,
287 or private entities and shall only be made available for a
288 single entry query of an individual in the event the
289 individual is a subject of interest in an active criminal

291 access the concealed carry permit system for administrative
292 purposes to issue a permit, verify the accuracy of permit
293 holder information, change the name or address of a permit
294 holder, suspend or revoke a permit, cancel an expired
295 permit, or cancel a permit upon receipt of a certified death
296 certificate for the permit holder. Any person who violates
297 the provisions of this subdivision by disclosing protected
298 information shall be guilty of a class A misdemeanor.
299 11. Information regarding any holder of a Missouri
300 lifetime or extended concealed carry permit is a closed
301 record. No bulk download or batch data shall be distributed
