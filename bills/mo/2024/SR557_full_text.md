SENATE RESOLUTION NO. 557
Notice is hereby given by the Senator from the Twenty-
third District of the one day notice required by rule
of intent to put a motion to adopt the following rule
change:
BE IT RESOLVED by the Senate of the One Hundred Second
General Assembly, Second Regular Session, that Senate Rules
50 and 60 be amended to read as follows:
"Rule 50. Referrals of bills and appointments to
committee shall be made by the president pro tem; and no
bill shall be considered for final passage unless it has
been reported on by a committee and printed for the use of
the senators. A report of all bills recommended "do pass"
by a committee shall be submitted to the senate by the
chairman and all committee amendments accompanying the
report shall be printed in the Journal. Every report of an
appropriations bill by the Committee on Appropriations shall
contain a notation for each section of the bill that
requires a new appropriation of general revenue or general
revenue equivalent.
After a bill has been referred to a committee, one-
third of the senators elected has the power to relieve a
committee of further consideration of a bill and place it on
the calendar for consideration. In any case where a
committee has been relieved of further consideration of a
bill as herein provided, a majority of the senators present
but not less than one-third of the senators elected, may, at
any time before final passage thereof, again refer the bill
to the same or some other committee for consideration. No
bill or resolution shall be reported adversely by any
committee until the author of the bill or resolution has
1
been given an opportunity to appear and be heard before the
committee to which it is referred.
One-third of the senators elected may relieve a
committee of an appointment and a motion to grant advice and
consent of the Senate to that appointment is then in order
upon a vote of the majority of the Senate.
Rule 60. 1. An amendment shall not go beyond the
second degree to an original bill.
2. Any section of an appropriations bill that has been
noted by the Committee on Appropriations in its report to
the senate as containing a new appropriation of general
revenue or general revenue equivalent shall be considered a
committee amendment and shall be voted upon separately upon
the bill being brought before the senate.
3. All amendments adopted by either house to a bill
pending and originating in the same shall be incorporated in
the bill, and the bill as perfected shall before the third
reading and final passage, be printed for the use of the
members. The printing of bills ordered to third reading and
final passage shall be under the supervision of the
Committee on Rules, Joint Rules, Resolutions and Ethics,
whose report shall set forth that they find the printed copy
of such bills as theretofore agreed and furnished for the
use of the members is correct. A correct record of each
day's proceedings in each house shall be furnished for the
use of the members of the general assembly before the record
is approved and no bill shall be signed by the presiding
officer of either house until such printed copy thereof
shall have been furnished for the use of the members of the
general assembly and the record of the previous day shall
have been approved. When agreed to by both houses, the bill
as finally passed shall be typed or printed and signed by
2
the presiding officer of each house and transmitted to the
governor.".
