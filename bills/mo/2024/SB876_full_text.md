153 taxpayer and a statement summarizing the investments made by
154 the eligible taxpayer.
155 9. The department of economic development may
156 promulgate rules governing the allowance of the income tax
157 credit provided for in this section, including provisions

171 their share of the income from the S corporation,
172 partnership, trust, or estate.
173 10. The department of revenue and the department of
174 economic development shall promulgate all necessary rules
175 and regulations for the administration of this section
SB 876 7
176 including, but not limited to, rules relating to the
177 verification of a taxpayer's qualified amount. Any rule or
178 portion of a rule, as that term is defined in section
179 536.010, that is created under the authority delegated in
180 this section shall become effective only if it complies with
181 and is subject to all of the provisions of chapter 536 and,
182 if applicable, section 536.028. This section and chapter
183 536 are nonseverable and if any of the powers vested with
184 the general assembly pursuant to chapter 536 to review, to
185 delay the effective date, or to disapprove and annul a rule
186 are subsequently held unconstitutional, then the grant of
187 rulemaking authority and any rule proposed or adopted after
188 August 28, 2024, shall be invalid and void.
189 11. Under section 23.253 of the Missouri sunset act:
