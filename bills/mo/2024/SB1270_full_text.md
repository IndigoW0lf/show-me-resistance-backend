23 facts indicating that such person may have violated
24 subsection 1 of this section, causes the signatures to be
25 submitted with reckless indifference as to whether such

SB 1270 10
1 116.110. Any voter who has signed an initiative or
2 referendum petition may withdraw his or her signature from
3 that petition by submitting to the secretary of state,
4 before the petition is filed with the secretary of state, a
5 sworn statement requesting that his or her signature be
6 withdrawn and affirming the name of the petition signed, the
7 name the voter used when signing the petition, the address
8 of the voter and the county of residence. It is a class A
9 misdemeanor punishable, notwithstanding the provisions of
10 section [560.021] 558.002 to the contrary, for a term of
11 imprisonment not to exceed one year in the county jail or a
12 fine not to exceed ten thousand dollars or both, to
13 knowingly file a false withdrawal statement with the
14 secretary of state.
1 116.130. 1. The secretary of state may send copies of
2 petition pages to election authorities to verify that the
3 persons whose names are listed as signers to the petition
4 are registered voters. Such verification may either be of
5 each signature or by random sampling as provided in section
6 116.120, as the secretary shall direct. If copies of the
7 petition pages are sent to an election authority for
8 verification, such copies shall be sent pursuant to the
9 following schedule:
10 (1) Copies of all pages from not less than one
11 petition shall be received in the office of the election
12 authority not later than two weeks after the petition is
13 filed in the office of secretary of state;
14 (2) Copies of all pages of a total of three petitions
15 shall be received in the office of the election authority
16 not later than three weeks after the petition is filed in
17 the office of the secretary of state;
SB 1270 11
18 (3) If more than three petitions are filed, all copies
19 of petition pages, including those petitions selected for
20 verification by random sample pursuant to section 116.120,
21 shall be received in the office of the election authority
22 not later than the fourth week after the petition is filed
23 in the office of the secretary of state.
24 Each election authority shall check the signatures against
25 voter registration records in the election authority's
26 jurisdiction, but the election authority shall count as
27 valid only the signatures of persons registered as voters in
28 the county named in the circulator's affidavit. Signatures
29 shall not be counted as valid if they have been struck
30 through or crossed out. Signatures shall be recorded in
31 dark ink.
32 2. If the election authority is requested to verify
33 the petition by random sampling, such verification shall be
34 completed and certified not later than thirty days from the
35 date that the election authority receives the petition from
36 the secretary of state. If the election authority is to
37 verify each signature, such verification [must] shall be
38 completed, certified and delivered to the secretary of state
39 by 5:00 p.m. on the last Tuesday in July prior to the
40 election, or in the event of complete verification of
41 signatures after a failed random sample, full verification
42 shall be completed, certified and delivered to the secretary
43 of state by 5:00 p.m. on the last Tuesday in July or by
44 5:00 p.m. on the Friday of the fifth week after receipt of
45 the signatures by the local election authority, whichever is
46 later.
47 3. If the election authority or the secretary of state
48 determines that the congressional district number written
SB 1270 12
49 after the signature of any voter is not the congressional
50 district of which the voter is a resident, the election
51 authority or the secretary of state shall correct the
52 congressional district number on the petition page. Failure
53 of a voter to give the voter's correct congressional
54 district number shall not by itself be grounds for not
55 counting the voter's signature.
56 4. The election authority shall return the copies of
57 the petition pages to the secretary of state with
58 annotations regarding any invalid or questionable signatures
59 which the election authority has been asked to check by the
60 secretary of state. The election authority shall verify the
61 number of pages received for that county, and also certify
62 the total number of valid signatures of voters from each
63 congressional district which the election authority has been
64 asked to check by the secretary of state.
65 5. The secretary of state is authorized to adopt rules
66 to ensure uniform, complete, and accurate checking of
67 petition signatures either by actual count or random
68 sampling. No rule or portion of a rule promulgated pursuant
69 to this section shall become effective unless it has been
70 promulgated pursuant to the provisions of chapter 536.
71 6. After a period of three years from the time of
72 submission of the petitions to the secretary of state, the
73 secretary of state, if the secretary determines that
74 retention of such petitions is no longer necessary, may
75 destroy such petitions.
1 116.190. 1. Any [citizen] Missouri registered voter
2 who wishes to challenge the official ballot title or the
3 fiscal note prepared for a proposed constitutional amendment
4 submitted by the general assembly, by initiative petition,
5 or by constitutional convention, or for a statutory
SB 1270 13
6 initiative or referendum measure, may bring an action in the
7 circuit court of Cole County. The action must be brought
8 within ten days after the official ballot title is certified
9 by the secretary of state in accordance with the provisions
10 of this chapter.
11 2. The secretary of state shall be named as a party
12 defendant in any action challenging the official ballot
13 title prepared by the secretary of state. When the action
14 challenges the fiscal note or the fiscal note summary
15 prepared by the auditor, the state auditor shall also be
16 named as a party defendant. The president pro tem of the
17 senate, the speaker of the house and the sponsor of the
18 measure and the secretary of state shall be the named party
19 defendants in any action challenging the official summary
20 statement, fiscal note or fiscal note summary prepared
21 pursuant to section 116.155.
22 3. The petition shall state the reason or reasons why
23 the summary statement portion of the official ballot title
24 is insufficient or unfair and shall request a different
25 summary statement portion of the official ballot title.
26 Alternatively, the petition shall state the reasons why the
27 fiscal note or the fiscal note summary portion of the
28 official ballot title is insufficient or unfair and shall
29 request a different fiscal note or fiscal note summary
30 portion of the official ballot title.
31 4. The action shall be placed at the top of the civil
32 docket. Insofar as the action challenges the summary
33 statement portion of the official ballot title, the court
34 shall consider the petition, hear arguments, and in its
35 decision certify the summary statement portion of the
36 official ballot title to the secretary of state. Insofar as
37 the action challenges the fiscal note or the fiscal note
SB 1270 14
38 summary portion of the official ballot title, the court
39 shall consider the petition, hear arguments, and in its
40 decision, either certify the fiscal note or the fiscal note
41 summary portion of the official ballot title to the
42 secretary of state or remand the fiscal note or the fiscal
43 note summary to the auditor for preparation of a new fiscal
44 note or fiscal note summary pursuant to the procedures set
45 forth in section 116.175. Any party [to the suit] may
46 appeal [to the supreme court] within ten days after [a
47 circuit court decision] the entry of judgment by the circuit
48 court. In making the legal notice to election authorities
49 under section 116.240, and for the purposes of section
50 116.180, the secretary of state shall certify the language
51 which the court certifies to him.
52 5. Any action brought under this section that is not
53 fully and finally adjudicated within one hundred eighty days
54 of filing, and more than fifty-six days prior to the
55 election in which the measure is to appear, including all
56 appeals, shall be extinguished, unless a court, before the
57 expiration of the foregoing periods, extends such period
58 upon [a] an express finding of good cause for such extension
59 but no extension shall cause the final adjudication to occur
60 less than fifty-six days before the date of the election.
61 Such good cause shall consist only of court-related
62 scheduling issues and shall not include requests for
63 continuance by the parties. No court, including any
64 appellate court, shall have the authority to issue any form
65 of relief after the expiration of the foregoing periods.
1 116.200. 1. After the secretary of state certifies a
2 petition as sufficient or insufficient, any [citizen]
3 Missouri registered voter may apply to the circuit court of
4 Cole County to compel [him] the secretary of state to
SB 1270 15
5 reverse his or her decision. The action must be brought
6 within ten days after the certification is made. All such
7 suits shall be advanced on the court docket and heard and
8 decided by the court as quickly as possible.
9 2. If the court decides the petition is sufficient,
10 the secretary of state shall certify it as sufficient and
11 attach a copy of the judgment. If the court decides the
12 petition is insufficient, the court shall enjoin the
13 secretary of state from certifying the measure and all other
14 officers from printing the measure on the ballot.
15 3. Any party may appeal within ten days after [a
16 decision is rendered, any party may appeal it to the supreme
17 court] the entry of the judgment by the circuit court.
1 116.332. 1. Before a constitutional amendment
2 petition, a statutory initiative petition, or a referendum
3 petition may be circulated for signatures, a sample sheet
4 [must] shall be submitted to the secretary of state in the
5 form in which it will be circulated. Sample sheets may be
6 submitted to the secretary of state any time after a general
7 election until six months prior to the next general
8 election. When a person submits a sample sheet of a
9 petition he or she shall designate to the secretary of state
10 the name and address of the person to whom any notices shall
11 be sent pursuant to sections 116.140 and 116.180 and, if a
12 committee or person, except the individual submitting the
13 sample sheet, is funding any portion of the drafting or
14 submitting of the sample sheet, the person submitting the
15 sample sheet shall submit a copy of the filed statement of
16 committee organization required under subsection 5 of
17 section 130.021 showing the date the statement was filed.
18 The secretary of state shall refer a copy of the petition
19 sheet to the attorney general for [his] approval and to the
SB 1270 16
20 state auditor for purposes of preparing a fiscal note and
21 fiscal note summary. The secretary of state and attorney
22 general [must] shall each review the petition for
23 [sufficiency as to form] compliance with section 116.050 and
24 Article III, Sections 28, 49, 50, 51, and 52(a) of the
25 Missouri Constitution and approve or reject the form of the
26 petition, stating the reasons for rejection, if any.
27 2. Within two business days of receipt of any such
28 sample sheet, the office of the secretary of state shall
29 conspicuously post on its website the text of the proposed
30 measure, a disclaimer stating that such text may not
31 constitute the full and correct text as required under
32 section 116.050, and the name of the person or organization
33 submitting the sample sheet. The secretary of state's
34 failure to comply with such posting shall be considered a
35 violation of chapter 610 and subject to the penalties
36 provided under subsection 3 of section 610.027. The posting
37 shall be removed within three days of either the withdrawal
38 of the petition under section 116.115 or the rejection for
39 any reason of the petition.
40 3. Upon receipt of a petition from the office of the
41 secretary of state, the attorney general shall examine the
42 petition [as to form] and determine whether it complies with
