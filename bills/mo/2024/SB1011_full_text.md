24 President of the United States, divide the most populous
25 township outside the city into eight subdistricts of
26 contiguous and compact territory and as nearly equal in
27 population as practicable. The subdistricts shall be
28 numbered from one upward consecutively, which numbers shall,
29 insofar as practicable, be retained upon reapportionment.
30 Two members of the county committee, a man and a woman,
31 shall be elected from each such subdistrict. Six members of
32 the committee, three men and three women, shall be elected
33 from the second and third most populous townships outside
34 the city. Four members of the committee, two men and two
35 women, shall be elected from the other townships outside the

42 and three women, shall be elected in the city as well as

50 inhabitants, the major portion of which is located in a
SB 1011 3
51 county with a charter form of government, for the portion of
52 the city located within such county and notwithstanding
53 section 82.110, it shall be the duty of the election
54 authority, not later than six months after the decennial
55 census has been reported to the President of the United
56 States, to divide such cities into not less than twenty-four
57 nor more than twenty-five wards after each decennial
58 census. Wards shall be so divided that the number of
59 inhabitants in any ward shall not exceed any other ward of
60 the city and within the same county, by more than five
61 percent, measured by the number of the inhabitants
62 determined at the preceding decennial census.
63 [4.] 5. In each county of the first classification
64 containing a portion, but not the major portion, of a city
65 which has over three hundred thousand inhabitants, ten
66 members of the committee, five men and five women, shall be

72 districts of contiguous territory as compact and as nearly
73 equal in population as may be; two members of the committee,
74 a man and a woman, shall be elected from each committee
75 district. The election authority shall divide the area of
76 the county located within legislative districts not wholly
77 contained in the county into similar committee districts;

79 elected from each committee district.
80 [5.] 6. In each city not situated in a county, two
81 members of the committee, a man and a woman, shall be
82 elected from each ward.

84 government and a population of over nine hundred thousand
85 inhabitants, the county committee persons shall be elected
86 from each township. Within ninety days after August 28,
87 2002, and within six months after each decennial census has
88 been reported to the President of the United States, the
89 election authority shall divide the county into twenty-eight
90 compact and contiguous townships containing populations as
91 nearly equal in population to each other as is practical.
92 [7.] 8. If any election authority has failed to adopt
93 a reapportionment plan by the deadline set forth in this
94 section, the county commission, sitting as a reapportionment
95 commission, shall within sixty days after the deadline,
96 adopt a reapportionment plan. Changes of township, ward, or
97 precinct lines shall not affect the terms of office of
98 incumbent party committee members elected from districts as
99 constituted at the time of their election.

5 committee shall meet on the same day at such place within
6 the city as the chair of the current city committee may
7 designate. In all counties of the first, second and third
8 classification the county courthouse shall be made available
9 for such meetings and any other county political party
10 meeting at no charge to the party committees. At the
11 meeting, each committee shall organize by electing one of
12 its members as chair and one of its members as vice chair, a
13 man and a woman, and a secretary and a treasurer, a man and
14 a woman, who may or may not be members of the committee.
15 The persons elected secretary and treasurer may vote on all
SB 1011 5
16 matters before the committee, regardless if such persons are
17 members of the committee, provided that if a person elected
18 secretary or treasurer is not a member of the committee,
19 then the person shall not vote for the nomination of
20 candidates for county office pursuant to subdivision (1) of
21 subsection 1 of section 115.365. The county chair and vice
22 chair so elected shall by virtue thereof become members of
23 the party congressional, senatorial and judicial committees
24 of the district of which their county is a part.

2 effective January 1, 2025.
