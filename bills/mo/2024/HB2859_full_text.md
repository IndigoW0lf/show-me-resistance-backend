40 from the issuing date of the warrant to the date of his arrest on the warrant, or continuance on
41 parole or conditional release shall be counted as time served under the sentence. In all other
42 cases, time served on parole or conditional release shall be counted as time served under the

57 present to the detaining authorities a similar statement of the circumstances of violation.
217.722. 1. If any probation officer has probable cause to believe that the person on
