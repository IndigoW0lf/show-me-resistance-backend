40 from the issuing date of the warrant to the date of his arrest on the warrant, or continuance on
41 parole or conditional release shall be counted as time served under the sentence. In all other
42 cases, time served on parole or conditional release shall be counted as time served under the
43 sentence.

53 defendant has, in the judgment of the parole or probation officer, violated the conditions of
54 his release. The written statement delivered with the person by the arresting officer to the

56 legal authority for detaining him. After making an arrest the parole or probation officer shall
57 present to the detaining authorities a similar statement of the circumstances of violation.
217.722. 1. If any probation officer has probable cause to believe that the person on
