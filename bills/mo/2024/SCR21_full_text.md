SENATE CONCURRENT RESOLUTION NO. 21
Relating to hypertrophic cardiomyopathy awareness day.
Whereas, hypertrophic cardiomyopathy ("HCM") is a
chronic cardiac disease involving thickening of the heart
muscle and which may lead to debilitating symptoms and
serious complications, including heart failure, atrial
fibrillation, stroke, and, in rare cases, sudden cardiac
death; and
Whereas, HCM is the most common inheritable heart
disease and may affect anyone, regardless of age, gender, or
ethnicity, with a reported prevalence ranging from one in
two hundred to one in five hundred in the general
population; and
Whereas, an estimated seven hundred thousand to one
million six hundred fifty thousand people in the United
States have HCM, but eighty-five percent of this number may
remain undiagnosed; and
Whereas, HCM shares symptoms with other common
cardiovascular and pulmonary diseases, such as shortness of
breath, chest pain, fatigue, palpitations, and fainting,
which makes it difficult to distinguish HCM from these other
diseases; and
Whereas, when untreated, all-cause mortality is three
to four times higher in patients with HCM than that of the
general population; and
Whereas, knowing one's medical history and any signs
and symptoms of HCM is an important first step in receiving
an accurate diagnosis of HCM; and
Whereas, a health care provider will need to conduct a
thorough screening with cardiac health questions to help
1
identify a risk of genetic and congenital cardiac disorders;
and
Whereas, a health care provider may conduct several
tests, including an echocardiogram, a cardiac magnetic
resonance imaging scan, or genetic testing in order to
confirm a family history of HCM, and will need to examine
the heart to diagnose HCM; and
Whereas, following a diagnosis of HCM, it is important
for patients to work with their health care provider to
learn more about their disease and to understand different
management options, including prescription medication and
surgical treatment options that may help:
Now, Therefore, Be It Resolved by the members of the
Missouri Senate, One Hundred Second General Assembly, Second
Regular Session, the House of Representatives concurring
therein, hereby designate the fourth Wednesday in February
of each year as "Hypertrophic Cardiomyopathy Awareness Day"
in Missouri; and
Be It Further Resolved that the General Assembly
encourages all residents of this state to participate in
activities to bring awareness of this disease and the need
for diagnosis and treatment; and
Be It Further Resolved that this resolution be sent to
the Governor for his approval or rejection pursuant to the
Missouri Constitution.
