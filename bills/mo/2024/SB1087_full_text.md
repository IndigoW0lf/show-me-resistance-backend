1 198.530. 1. If an enrollee in a managed care
2 organization is also a resident in a long-term care facility
3 licensed pursuant to chapter 198, or a continuing care
4 retirement community, [as defined in section 197.305,] such
5 enrollee's managed care organization shall provide the

6 enrollee with the option of receiving the covered service in
7 the long-term care facility which serves as the enrollee's
8 primary residence. For purposes of this section, "managed
9 care organization" means any organization that offers any
10 health plan certified by the department of health and senior
11 services designed to provide incentives to medical care
12 providers to manage the cost and use of care associated with
13 claims, including, but not limited to, a health maintenance
14 organization and preferred provider organization. The
15 resident enrollee's managed care organization shall
16 reimburse the resident facility for those services which
17 would otherwise be covered by the managed care organization
18 if the following conditions apply:
19 (1) The facility is willing and able to provide the
20 services to the resident; and
21 (2) The facility and those health care professionals
22 delivering services to residents pursuant to this section
23 meet the licensing and training standards as prescribed by
24 law; and
25 (3) The facility is certified through Medicare; and
26 (4) The facility and those health care professionals
27 delivering services to residents pursuant to this section
28 agree to abide by the terms and conditions of the health
29 carrier's contracts with similar providers, abide by patient
30 protection standards and requirements imposed by state or
31 federal law for plan enrollees and meet the quality
32 standards established by the health carrier for similar
33 providers.
34 2. The managed care organization shall reimburse the
35 resident facility at a rate of reimbursement not less than
36 the Medicare allowable rate pursuant to Medicare rules and
37 regulations.
SB 1087 3
38 3. The services in subsection 1 of this section shall
39 include, but are not limited to, skilled nursing care,
40 rehabilitative and other therapy services, and postacute
41 care, as needed. Nothing in this section shall limit the
42 managed care organization from utilizing contracted
43 providers to deliver the services in the enrollee's resident
44 facility.
45 4. A resident facility shall not prohibit a health
46 carrier's participating providers from providing covered
47 benefits to an enrollee in the resident facility. A
48 resident facility or health care professional shall not
49 impose any charges on an enrollee for any service that is
50 ancillary to, a component of, or in support of the services
51 provided under this section when the services are provided
52 by a health carrier's participating provider, or otherwise
53 create a disincentive for the use of the health carrier's
54 participating providers. Any violation of the requirements
55 of this subsection by the resident facility shall be
56 considered abuse or neglect of the resident enrollee.

7 operation, stock, leasehold interests by whatever form for
8 any facility previously licensed or certified for
9 participation in the Medicaid program. Increased costs for
10 the successor owner, management or leaseholder that result
11 from such a change shall not be recognized for purposes of
12 reimbursement;
SB 1087 4
13 (2) In the case of a newly built facility or part
14 thereof which is less than two years of age and enters the
15 Title XIX program under this chapter after July 1, 1983, a
16 reimbursement rate shall be assigned based on the lesser of
17 projected estimated operating costs or one hundred ten
18 percent of the median rate for the facility's class to
19 include urban and rural categories for each level of care
20 including ICF only and SNF/ICF. The rates set under this
21 provision shall be effective for a period of twelve months
22 from the effective date of the provider agreement at which
23 time the rate for the future year shall be set in accordance
24 with reported costs of the facility recognized under the

26 (4) of this subsection. Rates set under this section may in
27 no case exceed the maximum ceiling amounts in effect under
28 the reimbursement regulation;
29 (3) Reimbursement for capital related expenses for
30 newly built facilities entering the Title XIX program after
31 March 18, 1983, shall be calculated as the building and
32 building equipment rate, movable equipment rate, land rate,
33 and working capital rate.
34 (a) The building and building equipment rate will be
35 the lower of:
36 a. Actual acquisition costs, which is the original
37 cost to construct or acquire the building[, not to exceed
38 the costs as determined in section 197.357]; or
39 b. Reasonable construction or acquisition cost
40 computed by applying the regional Dodge Construction Index
41 for 1981 with a trend factor, if necessary, or another
42 current construction cost measure multiplied by one hundred
43 eight percent as an allowance for fees authorized as
44 architectural or legal not included in the Dodge Index
SB 1087 5
45 Value, multiplied by the square footage of the facility not
46 to exceed three hundred twenty-five square feet per bed,
47 multiplied by the ratio of forty minus the actual years of
48 the age of the facility divided by forty; and multiplied by
49 a return rate of twelve percent; and divided by ninety-three
50 percent of the facility's total available beds times three
51 hundred sixty-five days.
52 (b) The maximum movable equipment rate will be fifty-
53 three cents per bed day.
54 (c) The maximum allowable land area is defined as five
55 acres for a facility with one hundred or less beds and one
56 additional acre for each additional one hundred beds or
57 fraction thereof for a facility with one hundred one or more
58 beds.
59 (d) The land rate will be calculated as:
60 a. For facilities with land areas at or below the
61 maximum allowable land area, multiply the acquisition cost
62 of the land by the return rate of twelve percent, divide by
63 ninety-three percent of the facility's total available beds
64 times three hundred sixty-five days.
65 b. For facilities with land areas greater than the
66 maximum allowable land area, divide the acquisition cost of
67 the land by the total acres, multiply by the maximum
68 allowable land area, multiply by the return rate of twelve
69 percent, divide by ninety-three percent of the facility's
70 total available beds times three hundred sixty-five days.
71 (e) The maximum working capital rate will be twenty
72 cents per day;
73 (4) If a provider does not provide the actual
74 acquisition cost to determine a reimbursement rate under
75 subparagraph a. of paragraph (a) of subdivision (3) of
76 subsection 1 of this section, the sum of the building and
SB 1087 6
77 building equipment rate, movable equipment rate, land rate,
78 and working capital rate shall be set at a reimbursement
79 rate of six dollars;
80 (5) For each state fiscal year a negotiated trend
81 factor shall be applied to each facility's Title XIX per
82 diem reimbursement rate. The trend factor shall be
83 determined through negotiations between the department and
84 the affected providers and is intended to hold the providers
85 harmless against increase in cost. In no circumstances
86 shall the negotiated trend factor to be applied to state
87 funds exceed the health care finance administration market
88 basket price index for that year. The provisions of this
89 subdivision shall apply to fiscal year 1996 and thereafter.
90 2. The provisions of subdivisions (1), (2), (3), and
91 (4) of subsection 1 of this section shall remain in effect
92 until July 1, 1989, unless otherwise provided by law.

3 board of directors, limit or define the classes of persons
4 who shall be eligible to become members or beneficiaries,
5 limit and define the benefits which it will furnish, and may
6 define such benefits as it undertakes to furnish into
7 classes or kinds. It may make available to its members or
8 beneficiaries such health services, or reimbursement
9 therefor, as the board of directors of any such corporation
10 may approve; if maternity benefits are provided to any
11 members of any plan, then maternity benefits shall be
12 provided to any member of such plan without discrimination
13 as to whether the member is married or unmarried, and if
14 maternity benefits are provided to a beneficiary of any
15 plan, then maternity benefits shall be provided to such
SB 1087 7
16 beneficiary of such plan without discrimination as to
17 whether the beneficiary is married or unmarried.
18 2. [If an ambulatory surgical facility as defined by
19 subdivision (2) of section 197.200, has received a
20 certificate of need as provided in chapter 197,] A health
21 services corporation shall provide benefits to [the
22 facility] an ambulatory surgical center, as defined by
23 section 197.200, on the same basis as it does to all other
24 health care facilities, whether contracting members or
25 noncontracting members. A health services corporation shall
26 use the same standards that are applied to any other health
27 care facility within the same health services area in
28 defining the benefits that the corporation will furnish to
29 the ambulatory surgical facility, the classes to which such

98 shall not expand its licensed bed capacity in
99 that licensure category for a period of five
100 years from the date the licensure is
101 relinquished.
102 5. Any existing licensed and operating
103 health care facility offering long-term care
104 services may replace one-half of its licensed
105 beds at the same site or a site not more than
106 thirty miles from its current location if, for
107 at least the most recent four consecutive
SB 1087 16
108 calendar quarters, the facility operates only
109 fifty percent of its then licensed capacity with
110 every resident residing in a private room. In

113 health and senior services vacant beds as
114 unavailable for occupancy for at least the most
115 recent four consecutive calendar quarters;

123 writing that the existing facility beds to be
124 replaced will not later be used to provide long-
125 term care services. If the facility is being
126 operated under a lease, both the lessee and the
127 owner of the existing facility shall stipulate
128 the same in writing.

135 owners regardless of corporate or business
136 structure and the health care facility being
137 replaced remains unlicensed and unused for any
138 long-term care services whether they do or do
139 not require a license from the date of licensure
140 of the replacement facility.]
