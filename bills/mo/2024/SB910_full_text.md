120 application for the waiver of geographic proximity. If no
121 action is taken by the boards within forty-five days after

147 registered nurse's delivery of health care services. The
148 description shall include provisions that the advanced
149 practice registered nurse shall submit a minimum of ten
150 percent of the charts documenting the advanced practice
151 registered nurse's delivery of health care services to the
152 collaborating physician for review by the collaborating
153 physician, or any other physician designated in the
154 collaborative practice arrangement, every fourteen days;
155 (10) The collaborating physician, or any other
156 physician designated in the collaborative practice
157 arrangement, shall review every fourteen days a minimum of

171 except in extraordinary circumstances that shall be
172 documented, to participate in a chart review and to provide

176 arts pursuant to section 334.125 and the board of nursing
177 pursuant to section 335.036 may jointly promulgate rules
178 regulating the use of collaborative practice arrangements.
179 Such rules shall be limited to the methods of treatment that
180 may be covered by collaborative practice arrangements and
181 the requirements for review of services provided pursuant to
182 collaborative practice arrangements including delegating
183 authority to prescribe controlled substances. Any rules
184 relating to geographic proximity shall allow a collaborating
185 physician and a collaborating advanced practice registered

199 board of registration for the healing arts nor the board of
200 nursing may separately promulgate rules relating to
201 collaborative practice arrangements. Such jointly
202 promulgated rules shall be consistent with guidelines for
203 federally funded clinics. The rulemaking authority granted
204 in this subsection shall not extend to collaborative
205 practice arrangements of hospital employees providing
206 inpatient care within hospitals as defined pursuant to

211 disciplinary action against a physician for health care
212 services delegated to a registered professional nurse
213 provided the provisions of this section and the rules
214 promulgated thereunder are satisfied. Upon the written
215 request of a physician subject to a disciplinary action
216 imposed as a result of an agreement between a physician and
217 a registered professional nurse or registered physician
218 assistant, whether written or not, prior to August 28, 1993,
219 all records of such disciplinary licensure action and all
220 records pertaining to the filing, investigation or review of
221 an alleged violation of this chapter incurred as a result of
222 such an agreement shall be removed from the records of the
223 state board of registration for the healing arts and the
224 division of professional registration and shall not be
225 disclosed to any public or private entity seeking such
226 information from the board or the division. The state board
227 of registration for the healing arts shall take action to
228 correct reports of alleged violations and disciplinary
SB 910 11
229 actions as described in this section which have been
230 submitted to the National Practitioner Data Bank. In

232 or her medical practice, a physician completing forms or
233 documents shall not be required to report any actions of the
234 state board of registration for the healing arts for which
235 the records are subject to removal under this section.
236 6. Within thirty days of any change and on each
237 renewal, the state board of registration for the healing
238 arts shall require every physician to identify whether the
239 physician is engaged in any collaborative practice
240 arrangement, including collaborative practice arrangements
241 delegating the authority to prescribe controlled substances,
242 or physician assistant collaborative practice arrangement
243 and also report to the board the name of each licensed
244 professional with whom the physician has entered into such
245 arrangement. The board shall make this information
246 available to the public. The board shall track the reported
247 information and may routinely conduct random reviews of such
248 arrangements to ensure that arrangements are carried out for
249 compliance under this chapter.
250 7. [Notwithstanding any law to the contrary,] (1) A
251 certified registered nurse anesthetist, as defined in
252 subdivision (8) of section 335.016, may, but shall [be
253 permitted to provide anesthesia services without a

274 prohibit or prevent a certified registered nurse anesthetist
275 as defined in subdivision (8) of section 335.016 from
276 entering into a collaborative practice arrangement under
277 this section, except that the collaborative practice
278 arrangement may not delegate the authority to prescribe any

280 section 195.017, or Schedule II - hydrocodone.
281 8. A collaborating physician shall not enter into a

300 practicing in a setting where the collaborating physician is
301 not continuously present. This limitation shall not apply
302 to collaborative arrangements of providers of population-
303 based public health services, as defined by 20 CSR 2150-
304 5.100 as of April 30, 2008, or to collaborative practice
305 arrangements between a primary care physician and a primary
306 care advanced practice registered nurse or a behavioral
307 health physician and a behavioral health advanced practice
308 registered nurse, where the collaborating physician is new
309 to a patient population to which the advanced practice
310 registered nurse is familiar.
311 10. No agreement made under this section shall
312 supersede current hospital licensing regulations governing
313 hospital medication orders under protocols or standing
314 orders for the purpose of delivering inpatient or emergency
315 care within a hospital as defined in section 197.020 if such
316 protocols or standing orders have been approved by the
317 hospital's medical staff and pharmaceutical therapeutics
318 committee.
319 11. No contract or other term of employment shall
320 require a physician to act as a collaborating physician for
321 an advanced practice registered nurse against the
322 physician's will. A physician shall have the right to
323 refuse to act as a collaborating physician, without penalty,
324 for a particular advanced practice registered nurse. No
SB 910 14
325 contract or other agreement shall limit the collaborating
326 physician's ultimate authority over any protocols or
327 standing orders or in the delegation of the physician's
328 authority to any advanced practice registered nurse, but
329 this requirement shall not authorize a physician in
330 implementing such protocols, standing orders, or delegation
331 to violate applicable standards for safe medical practice
332 established by hospital's medical staff.
333 12. No contract or other term of employment shall
334 require any advanced practice registered nurse to serve as a
335 collaborating advanced practice registered nurse for any
336 collaborating physician against the advanced practice
337 registered nurse's will. An advanced practice registered
338 nurse shall have the right to refuse to collaborate, without
339 penalty, with a particular physician.

41 select, issue orders for, and administer controlled
42 substances listed in Schedules II, III, IV, and V of section
43 195.017 or other drugs or anesthetic agents for and during
44 the course of providing anesthesia care to a patient for a
45 surgical, obstetrical, therapeutic, or diagnostic procedure
