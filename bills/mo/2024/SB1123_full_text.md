148 between the charter school and the college or university for
149 purposes of teacher training and staff development,

158 tenths percent of the amount of state and local funding
159 allocated to the charter school under section 160.415, not
160 to exceed one hundred twenty-five thousand dollars, adjusted
161 for inflation. The department of elementary and secondary
162 education shall remit the retained funds for each charter
163 school to the school's sponsor, provided the sponsor remains
164 in good standing by fulfilling its sponsorship obligations
165 under sections 160.400 to 160.425 and 167.349 with regard to
166 each charter school it sponsors, including appropriate

182 terms;

184 performance, monitors compliance, informs intervention and
185 renewal decisions, and ensures autonomy provided under
186 applicable law; and

195 [13.] 11. No university, college or community college
196 shall grant a charter to a nonprofit corporation if an
197 employee of the university, college or community college is
198 a member of the corporation's board of directors.
199 [14.] 12. No sponsor shall grant a charter under
200 sections 160.400 to 160.425 and 167.349 without ensuring
201 that a criminal background check and family care safety
202 registry check are conducted for all members of the
203 governing board of the charter schools or the incorporators
204 of the charter school if initial directors are not named in
205 the articles of incorporation, nor shall a sponsor renew a
SB 1123 8
206 charter without ensuring a criminal background check and
207 family care safety registry check are conducted for each
208 member of the governing board of the charter school.
209 [15.] 13. No member of the governing board of a
210 charter school shall hold any office or employment from the

213 in section 105.450, in any entity employed by or contracting
214 with the board. No board member shall be an employee of a
215 company that provides substantial services to the charter
216 school. All members of the governing board of the charter
217 school shall be considered decision-making public servants
218 as defined in section 105.450 for the purposes of the

221 [16.] 14. A sponsor shall develop the policies and
222 procedures for:
223 (1) The review of a charter school proposal including
224 an application that provides sufficient information for
225 rigorous evaluation of the proposed charter and provides
226 clear documentation that the education program and academic
227 program are aligned with the state standards and grade-level
228 expectations, and provides clear documentation of effective
229 governance and management structures, and a sustainable
230 operational plan;
231 (2) The granting of a charter;
232 (3) The performance contract that the sponsor will use
233 to evaluate the performance of charter schools. Charter
234 schools shall meet current state academic performance
235 standards as well as other standards agreed upon by the
236 sponsor and the charter school in the performance contract;
SB 1123 9
237 (4) The sponsor's intervention, renewal, and

239 the charter sponsor may intervene in the operation of the

242 end of the term, consistent with subsections 8 and 9 of
243 section 160.405;
244 (5) Additional criteria that the sponsor will use for
245 ongoing oversight of the charter; and
246 (6) Procedures to be implemented if a charter school
247 should close, consistent with the provisions of subdivision
248 (15) of subsection 1 of section 160.405.
249 The department shall provide guidance to sponsors in
250 developing such policies and procedures.
251 [17.] 15. (1) A sponsor shall provide timely
252 submission to the state board of education of all data
253 necessary to demonstrate that the sponsor is in material

256 shall ensure each sponsor is in compliance with all
257 requirements under sections 160.400 to 160.425 and 167.349
258 for each charter school sponsored by any sponsor. The state
259 board shall notify each sponsor of the standards for
260 sponsorship of charter schools, delineating both what is
261 mandated by statute and what best practices dictate. The
262 state board shall evaluate sponsors to determine compliance
263 with these standards every three years. The evaluation
264 shall include a sponsor's policies and procedures in the
265 areas of charter application approval; required charter
266 agreement terms and content; sponsor performance evaluation
267 and compliance monitoring; and charter renewal,
SB 1123 10
268 intervention, and revocation decisions. Nothing shall
269 preclude the department from undertaking an evaluation at
270 any time for cause.
271 (2) If the department determines that a sponsor is in
272 material noncompliance with its sponsorship duties, the
273 sponsor shall be notified and given reasonable time for
274 remediation. If remediation does not address the compliance
275 issues identified by the department, the commissioner of
276 education shall conduct a public hearing and thereafter
277 provide notice to the charter sponsor of corrective action
278 that will be recommended to the state board of education.
279 Corrective action by the department may include withholding
280 the sponsor's funding and suspending the sponsor's authority
281 to sponsor a school that it currently sponsors or to sponsor
282 any additional school until the sponsor is reauthorized by
283 the state board of education under section 160.403.
284 (3) The charter sponsor may, within thirty days of
285 receipt of the notice of the commissioner's recommendation,
286 provide a written statement and other documentation to show
287 cause as to why that action should not be taken. Final
288 determination of corrective action shall be determined by
289 the state board of education based upon a review of the
290 documentation submitted to the department and the charter
291 sponsor.
292 (4) If the state board removes the authority to
293 sponsor a currently operating charter school under any
294 provision of law, the Missouri charter public school
295 commission shall become the sponsor of the school.
296 [18.] 16. If a sponsor notifies a charter school of
297 closure under subsection 8 of section 160.405, the
298 department of elementary and secondary education shall
299 exercise its financial withholding authority under
SB 1123 11
300 subsection 12 of section 160.415 to assure all obligations
301 of the charter school shall be met. The state, charter
302 sponsor, or resident district shall not be liable for any
303 outstanding liability or obligations of the charter school.
1 160.422. 1. Any city not within a county shall not
2 adopt, enforce, impose, or administer an ordinance, local
3 policy, or local resolution that prohibits property sold,
4 leased, or transferred by the city not within a county from
5 being used for any lawful educational purpose by a charter
6 school.
7 2. Any city not within a county shall not impose,
8 enforce, or apply any deed restriction that expressly, or by
9 its operation, prohibits property sold, leased, or
10 transferred by the city not within a county from being used
11 for any lawful educational purpose by a charter school. Any
12 deed restriction or affirmative use deed restriction that
13 affirmatively allows for only one or more specified uses or
14 purposes that do not include any educational use or purpose
15 is prohibited under this section. Any deed restriction or
16 affirmative use deed restriction in effect on the effective
17 date of this section that prohibits or does not permit
18 property previously used for any educational purpose from
19 being used for any future educational purpose is void.
20 3. If any city not within a county offers property of
21 the city not within a county for sale, lease, or rent, the
22 city not within a county shall not refuse to sell, lease, or
23 rent the property to a charter school solely because the
24 charter school intends to use the property for an
25 educational purpose, if the intent of the charter school is
26 to use the property for a lawful educational purpose. If
27 the city not within a county offers property of the city not
28 within a county for sale, lease, or rent, the city not
SB 1123 12
29 within a county is not required to sell, lease, or rent the
30 property to a charter school solely because the charter
31 school intends to use the property for an educational
32 purpose.
33 4. Any ordinance, policy, regulation, deed, or
34 contract made in violation of this section shall be void
35 from its inception.
