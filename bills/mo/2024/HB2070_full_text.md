12 between one point and another within this state or so far as such telecommunications services
13 are offered or provided by a telecommunications company between one point and another
14 within this state, except that nothing contained in this section shall be construed as conferring
15 jurisdiction upon the commission over the rates charged by a telephone cooperative for
16 providing telecommunications service within an exchange or within a local calling scope as
17 determined by the commission, except for exchange access service;
18 (3) To all water corporations, and to the land, property, dams, water supplies, or
19 power stations thereof and the operation of same within this state, except that nothing
20 contained in this section shall be construed as conferring jurisdiction upon the commission
21 over the service or rates of any municipally owned water plant or system in any city of this
22 state except where such service or rates are for water to be furnished or used beyond the
23 corporate limits of such municipality;
24 (4) To all sewer systems and their operations within this state and to persons or
25 corporations owning, leasing, operating or controlling the same;
26 (5) To all public utility corporations and persons whatsoever subject to the provisions

28 application of any interested person, decline jurisdiction and supervision over the sale and
29 distribution of electricity and the owning, operating, and controlling of related plant if such
30 sale and distribution is by a person authorized to provide such services in an adjoining state
31 with fewer than twenty residential customers in Missouri, all of whom are located within two
32 milesofthebordersofthestateofMissouriandifsuchcustomersareunabletoreceiveutility
33 servicesfromaninvestor-ownerutilityorruralelectriccooperativeduetoanaturalbarrier. If
34 the public service commission shall decline such jurisdiction and supervision, the Missouri
35 customers of such out-of-state utility shall receive services under the same terms and
36 conditions as the utility provides service to its customers in the nearest adjoining state;
37 (6) To the adoption of rules as are supported by evidence as to reasonableness and

393.106. 1. As used in this section, the following terms mean:
2 (1) "Auxiliary power", the energy used to operate equipment and other load that is
3 directly related to the production of energy by an independent power producer or electrical
4 corporation, obtained through generation at the site or through adjacent transformation and
HB 2070 3
5 transmission interconnect, but does not include energy used for space heating, lighting, air
6 conditioning, office needs of buildings, and other nongenerating uses at the generation site;
7 (2) "Independent power producer" or "IPP", an entity that is also considered a
8 nonutility power producer in the United States. IPPs are wholesale electricity producers that
9 operate within the franchised service territories of host utilities and are usually authorized to
10 sell at market-based rates. Unlike traditional electric utilities, IPPs do not possess
11 transmission facilities or sell electricity in the retail market;
12 (3) "Permanent service", electrical service provided through facilities which have
13 been permanently installed on a structure and which are designed to provide electric service
14 for the structure's anticipated needs for the indefinite future, as contrasted with facilities
15 installed temporarily to provide electrical service during construction. Service provided
16 temporarily shall be at the risk of the electrical supplier and shall not be determinative of the
17 rights of the provider or recipient of permanent service;
18 (4) "Structure" or "structures", an agricultural, residential, commercial, industrial or
19 other building or a mechanical installation, machinery or apparatus at which retail electric
20 energy is being delivered through a metering device which is located on or adjacent to the
21 structure and connected to the lines of an electrical supplier. Such terms shall include any
22 contiguous or adjacent additions to or expansions of a particular structure. Nothing in this
23 sectionshallbeconstruedtoconferanyrightonanelectricsuppliertoservenewstructureson
24 a particular tract of land because it was serving an existing structure on that tract.
25 2. Once an electrical corporation or joint municipal utility commission, or its
26 predecessor in interest, lawfully commences supplying retail electric energy to a structure
27 through permanent service facilities, it shall have the right to continue serving such structure,
28 and other suppliers of electrical energy shall not have the right to provide service to the
29 structure except as might be otherwise permitted in the context of municipal annexation,
30 pursuant to section 386.800 and section 394.080, or pursuant to a territorial agreement
31 approved under section 394.312, or pursuant to sections 393.2000 to 393.2170 relating to
32 thesale ofelectricenergyonandafter June1,2025. Thepublicservicecommission,upon

34 the public interest for a reason other than a rate differential. The commission's jurisdiction
35 under this section is limited to public interest determinations and excludes questions as to the
36 lawfulness of the provision of service, such questions being reserved to courts of competent
37 jurisdiction. Except as provided in this section, nothing contained herein shall affect the
38 rights, privileges or duties of existing corporations pursuant to this chapter. Nothing in this
39 section shall be construed to make lawful any provision of service which was unlawful prior
40 to July 11, 1991. Nothing in this section shall be construed to make unlawful the continued
41 lawful provision of service to any structure which may have had a different supplier in the
HB 2070 4
42 past, if such a change in supplier was lawful at the time it occurred. However, those
43 customers who had cancelled service with their previous supplier or had requested
44 cancellation by May 1, 1991, shall be eligible to change suppliers as per previous procedures.
45 No customer shall be allowed to change electric suppliers by disconnecting service between
46 May 1, 1991, and July 11, 1991.
47 3. Notwithstanding the provisions of subsection 2 of this section or any other
48 provision of chapter 386 or 394 to the contrary, auxiliary power may be purchased on a
49 wholesale basis, under the applicable federal tariffs of a regional transmission organization
50 instead of under retail service tariffs filed with the public service commission by an electrical
51 corporation, for use at an electric generation facility located in any county of the first
52 classification with more than ninety-two thousand but fewer than one hundred one thousand
53 inhabitants which commenced commercial operations prior to August 28, 2021, and which is
54 operated as an independent power producer.
55 4. Notwithstanding the provisions of this section, and sections 91.025, 394.080, and
56 394.315 to the contrary, in the event that a retail electric supplier is providing service to a
57 structure located within a city, town, or village that has ceased to be a rural area, and such
58 structure is demolished and replaced by a new structure, such retail electric service supplier
59 may provide permanent service to the new structure upon the request of the owner of the new
60 structure.
393.110. 1. Sections 393.110 to 393.285 shall apply to the manufacture and
2 furnishing of gas for light, heat or power and the furnishing of natural gas for light, heat or
3 power, and the generation, furnishing and transmission of electricity for light, heat or power,
4 the supplying and distributing of water for any purpose whatsoever, and the furnishing of a
5 sewer system for the collection, carriage, treatment or disposal of sewage for municipal,
6 domestic or other beneficial or necessary purpose, except as set forth in the provisions of
7 sections 393.2000 to 393.2160 relating to the sale of electric energy on and after June 1,
8 2025.
9 2. Notwithstanding any provision in chapter 386 or this chapter to the contrary, the
10 public service commission shall not have jurisdiction over the rates, financing, accounting, or
11 management of any electrical corporation which is required by its bylaws to operate on the
12 not-for-profit cooperative business plan, with its consumers who receive service as the
13 stockholders of such corporation, and which holds a certificate of public convenience and
14 necessity to serve a majority of its consumer-owners in counties of the third classification as
15 of August 28, 2003. Nothing in this section shall be construed as amending or superseding
16 the commission's authority granted in and pursuant to subsection 1 of section 386.310, in
17 section 386.800, section 393.106, and section 394.312.
HB 2070 5
393.130. 1. Every gas corporation, every electrical corporation, every water
2 corporation, and every sewer corporation shall furnish and provide such service
3 instrumentalities and facilities as shall be safe and adequate and in all respects just and
4 reasonable. All charges made or demanded by any such gas corporation, electrical
5 corporation, water corporation or sewer corporation for gas, electricity, water, sewer or any
6 service rendered or to be rendered shall be just and reasonable and not more than allowed by
7 law or by order or decision of the commission. Every unjust or unreasonable charge made or
8 demanded for gas, electricity, water, sewer or any such service, or in connection therewith, or
9 in excess of that allowed by law or by order or decision of the commission is prohibited,
10 subject to the provisions of sections 393.2000 to 393.2160 relating to the sale of electric
11 energy on and after June 1, 2025.

17 collects or receives from any other person or corporation for doing a like and
18 contemporaneous service with respect thereto under the same or substantially similar
19 circumstances or conditions.
20 3. No gas corporation, electrical corporation, water corporation or sewer corporation
21 shall make or grant any undue or unreasonable preference or advantage to any person,
22 corporation or locality, or to any particular description of service in any respect whatsoever,
23 or subject any particular person, corporation or locality or any particular description of
24 service to any undue or unreasonable prejudice or disadvantage in any respect whatsoever.
25 4. Nothing in this section shall be taken to prohibit a gas corporation, electrical
26 corporation, water corporation or sewer corporation from establishing a sliding scale for a
27 fixed period for the automatic adjustment of charges for gas, electricity, water, sewer or any
28 service rendered or to be rendered and the dividends to be paid stockholders of such gas
29 corporation, electrical corporation, water corporation or sewer corporation; provided, that the
30 sliding scale shall first have been filed with and approved by the commission; but nothing in
31 this subsection shall operate to prevent the commission after the expiration of such fixed
32 period from fixing proper, just and reasonable rates and charges to be made for service as
33 authorized in sections 393.110 to 393.285.
34 5. No water corporation shall be permitted to charge any municipality or fire

39 and reasonable rate to be charged for water. Any such fee or rental charge being made for
40 such fire hydrants whether by contract or otherwise at the time this act shall take effect may
41 remain in effect for a period of one hundred twenty days after this section shall take effect.

5 service, is unjust and unreasonable, and is prohibited, subject to the provisions of sections
6 393.2000 to 393.2160 relating to the sale of electric energy on and after June 1, 2025.
393.230. 1. The commission shall have the power to ascertain the value of the
2 property of every gas corporation, electrical corporation, water corporation and sewer
3 corporationinthisstateandeveryfactwhichinitsjudgmentmayordoeshaveanybearingon
4 such value. The commission shall have power to make revaluations from time to time and to

9 2. For the purpose of ascertaining the matters and things specified in this section,
10 concerning the value of the property of gas corporations, electrical corporations, water
11 corporations and sewer corporations, the commission may cause a hearing or hearings to be
12 held at such time or times and place or places as the commission may designate. Before any
13 hearing is had the commission shall give the gas corporation, electrical corporation, water
14 corporation or sewer corporation affected thereby at least thirty days' notice, specifying the
15 time and place of such hearing, and such notice shall be sufficient to authorize the
16 commission to inquire into the matters designated in this section, but this provision shall not
17 prevent the commission from making any preliminary examination or investigation into the
HB 2070 7
18 matters herein referred to, or from inquiring into such matters in any other investigation or
19 hearing. All gas corporations, electrical corporations, water corporations and sewer
20 corporationsaffectedshallbeentitledtobeheardandtointroduceevidenceatsuchhearingor
21 hearings. The commission is empowered to resort to any other source of information
22 available. The evidence introduced at such hearings shall be reduced to writing and certified
23 under the seal of the commission. The commission shall make and file its findings of fact in
24 writing upon all matters concerning which evidence shall have been introduced before it
25 which in its judgment have bearing on the value of the property of the gas corporation,
26 electrical corporation, water corporation or sewer corporation affected.
27 3. Such findings shall be subject to review by any circuit court of this state in the
28 same manner and within the same time as other orders and decisions of the commission. The
29 findings of the commission so made and filed, when properly certified under the seal of the
30 commission, shall be admissible in evidence in any action, proceeding or hearing before the
31 commission or any court, in which the commission, the state or an officer, department or
32 institution thereof, or any county, city or municipality or other body politic and the gas
33 corporation, electrical corporation, water corporation or sewer corporation affected may be
34 interested whether arising under the provisions of this chapter or otherwise, and such
35 findings, when sointroduced, shall be conclusive evidence ofthe facts therein stated as ofthe
36 date therein stated under conditions then existing, and such facts can only be controverted by
37 showing a subsequent change in conditions bearing upon the facts therein determined.
38 4. The commission may from time to time cause further hearings and investigations
39 to be had for the purpose of making revaluations or ascertaining the value of any betterments,
40 improvements, additions or extensions made by any gas corporation, electrical corporation,
41 water corporation or sewer corporation subsequent to any prior hearing or investigation, and
42 may examine into all matters which may change, modify or affect any finding of fact
43 previously made, and may at such time make findings of fact supplementary to those
44 theretofore made. Such hearings shall be had upon the same notice and be conducted in the
45 same manner, and the findings so made shall have the same force and effect as is provided
46 herein for such original notice, hearing and findings; provided, that such findings made at
47 such supplemental hearings or investigations shall be considered in connection with and as a
48 part of the original findings except insofar as such supplemental findings shall change or
49 modify the findings made at the original hearing or investigation.
393.240. 1. The commission shall have power, after hearing, to require any or all gas
2 corporations, electrical corporations, water corporations and sewer corporations to carry a
3 proper and adequate depreciation account in accordance with such rules, regulations and
4 forms of account as the commission may prescribe. This section shall be subject to the
HB 2070 8
5 provisions of sections 393.2000 to 393.2160 relating to the sale of electric energy on and
6 after June 1, 2025.
7 2. The commission may, from time to time, ascertain and determine and by order fix
8 the proper and adequate rates of depreciation of the several classes of property of such
9 corporation, person or public utility. Each gas corporation, electrical corporation, water
10 corporation and sewer corporation shall conform its depreciation accounts to the rates so
11 ascertained, determined and fixed, and shall set aside the moneys so provided for out of
12 earnings and carry the same in a depreciation fund and expend such fund only for such
13 purposesandundersuchrulesandregulations,bothastooriginalexpenditureandsubsequent
14 replacement, as the commission may prescribe. The income from investments of moneys in
15 such fund shall likewise be carried in such fund.
393.250. 1. Reorganizations of gas corporations, electrical corporations, water
2 corporations and sewer corporations shall be subject to the supervision and control of the
3 commission, and no such reorganization shall be had without the authorization of the
4 commission. This section shall be subject to the provisions of sections 393.2000 to
5 393.2160 relating to the sale of electric energy on and after June 1, 2025.
6 2. Upon all such reorganizations the amount of capitalization, including therein all
7 stocks and bonds and other evidence of indebtedness, shall be such as is authorized by the
8 commission, which in making its determinations, shall not exceed the fair value of the
9 property involved, taking into consideration its original cost of construction, duplication cost,
10 present condition, earning power at reasonable rates and all other relevant matters and any
11 additional sum or sums as shall be actually paid in cash; provided, however, that the
12 commission may make due allowance for the discount of bonds.
13 3. Anyreorganizationagreementbeforeitbecomeseffectiveshallbeamendedsothat
14 the amount of capitalization shall conform to the amount authorized by the commission. The
15 commission may by its order impose such condition or conditions as it may deem reasonable
16 and necessary.
393.270. 1. Before proceeding under a complaint presented as provided in sections
2 393.110 to 393.285, the commission shall cause notice of such complaint, and the purpose
3 thereof, to be served upon the person or corporation affected thereby. Such person or
4 corporation shall have an opportunity to be heard in respect to the matters complained of at a
5 time and place to be specified in such notice. An investigation may be instituted by the
6 commission as to any matter of which complaint may be made as provided in sections
7 393.110 to 393.285, orto enableit to ascertain the facts requisite to the exerciseof any power
8 conferred upon it.
9 2. After a hearing and after such investigation as shall have been made by the
10 commission or its officers, agents, examiners or inspectors, the commission within lawful
HB 2070 9
11 limits may, by order, fix the maximum price of gas, electricity, water or sewer service not
12 exceeding that fixed by statute to be charged by such corporation or person, for the service to
13 be furnished; and may order such improvement in the manufacture, distribution or supply of
14 gas, in the manufacture, transmission or supply of electricity, in the distribution or supply of
15 water, in the collection, carriage, treatment and disposal of sewage, or in the methods
16 employed by such persons or corporation as will in its judgment be adequate, just and
17 reasonable.
18 3. The price fixed by the commission under sections 393.110 to 393.285 shall be the
19 maximum price to be charged by such corporation or person for gas, electricity or water for
20 the service to be furnished within the territory and for a period to be fixed by the commission
21 in the order, not exceeding three years, except in the case of a sliding scale, and thereafter
22 until the commission shall, upon its own motion or upon the complaint of any corporation or
23 person interested, fix a higher or lower maximum price of gas, electricity, water or sewer
24 service to be thereafter charged.
25 4. In determining the price to be charged for gas, electricity, or water the commission
26 mayconsider all facts which in its judgment have any bearing upona proper determination of
27 the question although not set forth in the complaint and not within the allegations contained
28 therein, with due regard, among other things, to a reasonable average return upon capital
29 actually expended and to the necessity of making reservations out of income for surplus and
30 contingencies.
31 5. In determining the price to be charged for sewer service the commission may
32 consider all facts which in its judgment have any bearing upon a proper determination of the
33 question although not set forth in the complaint and not within the allegations contained
34 therein,with dueregard, amongother things, toa reasonable average returnupon thevalue of
35 thepropertyactuallyusedinthepublicserviceandtothenecessityofmakingreservationsout
36 of income for surplus and contingencies.
37 6. This section shall be subject to the provisions of sections 393.2000 to 393.2160
38 relating to the sale of electric energy on and after June 1, 2025.
393.297. 1. It is the intent of the general assembly through the passage of this act:
2 (1) To maintain a fair and equitable tax structure and to preserve the local tax base by
3 requiring all persons who provide electricity or gas service to pay an equitable share; and
4 (2) To equalize the amount of business taxes, franchise fees and payments in lieu of
5 taxes on competing suppliers of electricity and gas service.
6 (3) To restore to political subdivisions revenue sources that existed prior to any
7 previously implemented gas industry restructuring.
HB 2070 10
8 (4) To remove disparities in the liability of natural gas suppliers for business taxes,
9 franchise fees, and payments in lieu of taxes, which disparities have arisen as a result of any
10 previously implemented gas industry restructuring.
11 2. Political subdivisions provide police, fire and public health services, including the
12 inspection of gas and electric equipment and other facilities used in the consumption of gas
13 and electricity. Political subdivisions impose license taxes, franchise fees and sales taxes on
14 providers of electricity and gas services, and require payments in lieu of taxes from publicly
15 owned utilities in order to pay for these and other services related to the transportation, use
16 and consumption of electricity and gas services and for the general operation of government.
17 3. Missouri has historically restricted competition with respect to electricity and gas
18 services by authorizing the Missouri public service commission to limit the number of
19 providers and has allowed political subdivisions to require franchises for these services.
20 Persons entering the gas and electric markets within Missouri receive substantial revenues
21 from consumers in Missouri, thereby creating a purposeful economic presence in this state.
22 In addition, these persons may also cause electricity and gas to be transported over rights-of-
23 way and utility easements and may use electric lines orgas lines which are owned, controlled
24 and maintained by other public and private entities in this state. Unless all participants in the
25 electricity and gas markets pay comparable taxes and fees, there will be significant tax and
26 franchise fee revenue losses by political subdivisions and unfair competitive disparities
27 among such participants.
28 4. The legislature finds that electricity and gas are essential, but potentially
29 dangerous, commodities in modern society. The electricity transmission and distribution
30 system is an interconnected and interdependent grid. Therefore, the legislature finds that it is
31 in the interest of public health and safety to require registration of all sellers of electricity and
32 gas for use or consumption within Missouri.
33 5. It is not the intent of this act to regulate the transportation of natural gas, methane,
34 or propane in interstate commerce to the extent that such regulation is preempted by the
35 Constitution of the United States.
36 6. The provisions of sections 393.297 to 393.302 shall be subject to the provisions
37 of sections 393.2000 to 393.2160 relating to the sale of electric energy on and after June
38 1, 2025.
393.355. 1. As used in this section, the following terms shall mean:
2 (1) "Electrical corporation", the same meaning given to the term in section 386.020,
3 but shall not include an electrical corporation as described in subsection 2 of section 393.110;
4 (2) "Facility", a:
5 (a) Facility whose primary industry is the processing of primary metals;
HB 2070 11
6 (b) Facility whose primary industry is the production or fabrication of steel, North
7 American Industrial Classification System 331110; or
8 (c) Facility with a new or incremental increase in load equal to or in excess of a
9 monthly demand of fifty megawatts.
