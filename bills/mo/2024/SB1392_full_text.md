1 135.713. 1. Any taxpayer who makes a qualifying
2 contribution to an educational assistance organization after

11 taxpayer's dependent or, in the case of a business taxpayer,
12 on behalf of the business's agent's dependent.
13 2. The amount of the tax credit claimed shall not
14 exceed fifty percent of the taxpayer's state tax liability
15 for the tax year for which the credit is claimed. The state
16 treasurer shall certify the tax credit amount to the

30 [such annual increase will cease when the amount of tax

48 period. The state treasurer may establish more than one
SB 1392 3
49 period and reallocate more than once during each calendar
50 year. The state treasurer shall establish the procedure

59 sections 166.700 to 166.720 shall be effective in any fiscal
60 year immediately subsequent to any fiscal year in which the
61 amount appropriated for pupil transportation under section
62 163.161 equals or exceeds forty percent of the projected
63 amount necessary to fully fund transportation aid funding
64 for fiscal year 2021. If the amount appropriated for
65 transportation under section 163.161 in any succeeding year
66 falls below such amount, no additional scholarships for
67 newly qualified students shall be awarded.]

223 16. A sponsor shall develop the policies and
224 procedures for:
225 (1) The review of a charter school proposal including
226 an application that provides sufficient information for
SB 1392 18
227 rigorous evaluation of the proposed charter and provides
228 clear documentation that the education program and academic
229 program are aligned with the state standards and grade-level
230 expectations, and provides clear documentation of effective
231 governance and management structures, and a sustainable
232 operational plan;
233 (2) The granting of a charter;
234 (3) The performance contract that the sponsor will use
235 to evaluate the performance of charter schools. Charter
236 schools shall meet current state academic performance
237 standards as well as other standards agreed upon by the
238 sponsor and the charter school in the performance contract;
239 (4) The sponsor's intervention, renewal, and
240 revocation policies, including the conditions under which
241 the charter sponsor may intervene in the operation of the
242 charter school, along with actions and consequences that may
243 ensue, and the conditions for renewal of the charter at the
244 end of the term, consistent with subsections 8 and 9 of
245 section 160.405;
246 (5) Additional criteria that the sponsor will use for

251 The department shall provide guidance to sponsors in
252 developing such policies and procedures.
253 17. (1) A sponsor shall provide timely submission to
254 the state board of education of all data necessary to
255 demonstrate that the sponsor is in material compliance with
256 all requirements of sections 160.400 to 160.425 and section
257 167.349. The state board of education shall ensure each
SB 1392 19
258 sponsor is in compliance with all requirements under
259 sections 160.400 to 160.425 and 167.349 for each charter
260 school sponsored by any sponsor. The state board shall
261 notify each sponsor of the standards for sponsorship of
262 charter schools, delineating both what is mandated by
263 statute and what best practices dictate. The state board
264 shall evaluate sponsors to determine compliance with these
265 standards every three years. The evaluation shall include a
266 sponsor's policies and procedures in the areas of charter
267 application approval; required charter agreement terms and
268 content; sponsor performance evaluation and compliance
269 monitoring; and charter renewal, intervention, and
270 revocation decisions. Nothing shall preclude the department
271 from undertaking an evaluation at any time for cause.
272 (2) If the department determines that a sponsor is in
273 material noncompliance with its sponsorship duties, the
274 sponsor shall be notified and given reasonable time for
275 remediation. If remediation does not address the compliance
276 issues identified by the department, the commissioner of
277 education shall conduct a public hearing and thereafter
278 provide notice to the charter sponsor of corrective action
279 that will be recommended to the state board of education.
280 Corrective action by the department may include withholding
281 the sponsor's funding and suspending the sponsor's authority
282 to sponsor a school that it currently sponsors or to sponsor
283 any additional school until the sponsor is reauthorized by
284 the state board of education under section 160.403.
285 (3) The charter sponsor may, within thirty days of
286 receipt of the notice of the commissioner's recommendation,
287 provide a written statement and other documentation to show
288 cause as to why that action should not be taken. Final
289 determination of corrective action shall be determined by
SB 1392 20
290 the state board of education based upon a review of the
291 documentation submitted to the department and the charter
292 sponsor.
293 (4) If the state board removes the authority to
294 sponsor a currently operating charter school under any
295 provision of law, the Missouri charter public school
296 commission shall become the sponsor of the school.
297 18. If a sponsor notifies a charter school of closure
298 under subsection 8 of section 160.405, the department of
299 elementary and secondary education shall exercise its
300 financial withholding authority under subsection 12 of
301 section 160.415 to assure all obligations of the charter
302 school shall be met. The state, charter sponsor, or
303 resident district shall not be liable for any outstanding
304 liability or obligations of the charter school.
