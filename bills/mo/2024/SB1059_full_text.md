7 modifier for the district, and subtracting from this product
SB 1059 9
8 the district's local effort and subtracting payments from
9 the classroom trust fund under section 163.043.
10 2. Other provisions of law to the contrary
11 notwithstanding:
12 (1) For districts with an average daily attendance of
13 more than three hundred fifty in the school year preceding
14 the payment year:
15 (a) For the 2008-09 school year, the state revenue per
16 weighted average daily attendance received by a district
17 from the state aid calculation under subsections 1 and 4 of
18 this section, as applicable, and the classroom trust fund
19 under section 163.043 shall not be less than the state
20 revenue received by a district in the 2005-06 school year
21 from the foundation formula, line 14, gifted, remedial
22 reading, exceptional pupil aid, fair share, and free
23 textbook payment amounts multiplied by the dollar value
24 modifier, and dividing this product by the weighted average
25 daily attendance computed for the 2005-06 school year;
26 (b) For each year subsequent to the 2008-09 school
27 year, the amount shall be no less than that computed in
28 paragraph (a) of this subdivision, multiplied by the

40 the 2004-05 or 2005-06 school year from the foundation
41 formula, line 14, gifted, remedial reading, exceptional

51 3. School districts that meet the requirements of
52 section 163.021 shall receive categorical add-on revenue as

62 adjusted to accommodate available appropriations.
63 4. For any school district meeting the eligibility
64 criteria for state aid as established in section 163.021,
65 but which is considered an option district under section
66 163.042 and therefore receives no state aid, the
67 commissioner of education shall present a plan to the
68 superintendent of the school district for the waiver of
69 rules and the duration of said waivers, in order to promote
70 flexibility in the operations of the district and to enhance

71 and encourage efficiency in the delivery of instructional
72 services as provided in section 163.042.
73 5. (1) No less than seventy-five percent of the state

95 spent per the second preceding year's weighted average daily
96 attendance for certificated compensation and tuition
97 expenditures the previous year from revenue produced by
98 local and county tax sources in the teachers' fund, plus the
99 amount of the incidental fund to teachers' fund transfer
100 calculated to be local and county tax sources by dividing
101 local and county tax sources in the incidental fund by total
102 revenue in the incidental fund.
SB 1059 12
103 In the event a district fails to comply with this provision,
104 the amount by which the district fails to spend funds as
105 provided herein shall be deducted from the district's state
106 revenue received under the provisions of subsections 1 and 2
107 of this section for the following year, provided that the
108 state board of education may exempt a school district from
109 this provision if the state board of education determines
110 that circumstances warrant such exemption.
111 6. (1) If a school district's annual audit discloses
112 that students were inappropriately identified as eligible
113 for free and reduced price lunch, special education, or
114 limited English proficiency and the district does not
115 resolve the audit finding, the department of elementary and
116 secondary education shall require that the amount of aid
117 paid pursuant to the weighting for free and reduced price
118 lunch, special education, or limited English proficiency in
119 the weighted average daily attendance on the inappropriately
120 identified pupils be repaid by the district in the next
121 school year and shall additionally impose a penalty of one
122 hundred percent of such aid paid on such pupils, which
123 penalty shall also be paid within the next school year.
124 Such amounts may be repaid by the district through the
125 withholding of the amount of state aid.
126 (2) In the 2017-18 school year and in each subsequent
127 school year, if a district experiences a decrease in its
128 gifted program enrollment of twenty percent or more from the
129 previous school year, an amount equal to the product of the
130 difference between the number of students enrolled in the
131 gifted program in the current school year and the number of
132 students enrolled in the gifted program in the previous
133 school year multiplied by six hundred eighty dollars shall
134 be subtracted from the district's current year payment
SB 1059 13
135 amount. The provisions of this subdivision shall apply to
136 districts entitled to receive state aid payments under both
137 subsections 1 and 2 of this section but shall not apply to
138 any school district with an average daily attendance of
139 three hundred fifty or less.
140 7. Notwithstanding any provision of law to the
141 contrary, in any fiscal year during which the total formula
142 appropriation is insufficient to fully fund the entitlement
143 calculation of this section, the department of elementary
144 and secondary education shall adjust the state adequacy
145 target in order to accommodate the appropriation level for
146 the given fiscal year. In no manner shall any payment
147 modification be rendered for any district qualified to
148 receive payments under subsection 2 of this section based on
149 insufficient appropriations.
150 8. Notwithstanding any provision of law to the
151 contrary, school districts that receive revenue from the tax
152 authorized under sections 148.030, 148.140, 148.620, and
153 148.720 shall, beginning January 1, 2020, and every January
154 first thereafter, report the amount of said revenue received
155 by the district to the department. The department shall,
156 based on the data submitted by the district, determine the
157 total amount of revenue the district would have received
158 from the tax authorized under sections 148.030, 148.140,
159 148.620, and 148.720 absent the provisions of section
160 148.720, and remit the following amount to each applicable
161 district not less than thirty days after the conclusion of
162 each calendar year. The amount remitted to each district
163 shall be the total of the revenue received by the district
164 from the tax authorized under sections 148.030, 148.140,
165 148.620, and 148.720 during the applicable calendar year
166 times one and five thousand six hundred twenty-five ten
SB 1059 14
167 thousandths minus the total of the revenue received by the
168 district from the tax authorized under sections 148.030,
169 148.140, 148.620, and 148.720 during the same calendar
170 year. This payment shall be in addition to payments
171 authorized under subsections 1, 2, and 7 of this section and
172 shall be made from the annual appropriation to fund this
173 section.
174 9. Nothing in this section shall be construed to
175 authorize a district in need, as such term is defined in
176 section 162.1400, to spend or transfer any state funds
177 except as authorized pursuant to the provisions of section
178 162.1402.
1 163.043. 1. For fiscal year 2007 and each subsequent
2 fiscal year, the "Classroom Trust Fund", which is hereby
3 created in the state treasury, shall be distributed by the
4 state board of education to each school district in this
5 state qualified to receive state aid pursuant to section
6 163.021 on an average daily attendance basis.
7 2. The moneys distributed pursuant to this section
8 shall be spent at the discretion of the local school

SB 1059 15
21 notwithstanding any other provision of law to the contrary,
22 all unclaimed lottery prize money.
23 4. The provisions of this section shall not apply to
24 any option district as defined in section 163.042.
25 5. For the 2010-11 school year and for each subsequent
26 year, all proceeds a school district receives from the
27 classroom trust fund in excess of the amount the district
28 received from the classroom trust fund in the 2009-10 school
29 year shall be placed to the credit of the district's
30 teachers' and incidental funds.
31 6. Nothing in this section shall be construed to
32 authorize a district in need, as such term is defined in

34 except as authorized pursuant to the provisions of section
35 162.1402.
1 163.044. 1. Beginning with the 2007 fiscal year and
2 each subsequent fiscal year, the general assembly shall

5 attendance of three hundred fifty students or less in the
6 school year preceding the payment year:
7 (1) Ten million dollars shall be distributed to the
8 eligible districts in proportion to their average daily
9 attendance; and
10 (2) Five million dollars shall be directed to the
11 eligible districts that have an operating levy for school
12 purposes in the current year equal to or greater than the
13 performance levy and any school districts which have an
14 operating levy for school purposes in the current year less
15 than the performance levy solely due to a modification of
16 such district's levy required under subdivision (4) of
17 subsection 5 of section 137.073. A tax-rate-weighted
SB 1059 16
18 average daily attendance shall be calculated for each
19 eligible district in proportion to its operating levy for
20 school purposes for the current year divided by the
21 performance levy with that result multiplied by the
22 district's average daily attendance in the school year
23 preceding the payment year. The total appropriation
24 pursuant to this subdivision shall then be divided by the
25 sum of the tax-rate-weighted average daily attendance of the
26 eligible districts, and the resulting amount per tax-rate-
27 weighted average daily attendance shall be multiplied by
28 each eligible district's tax-rate-weighted average daily
29 attendance to determine the amount to be paid to each
30 eligible district.
31 2. The payment under this section shall not be
32 transferred to the capital projects fund.

34 districts receiving payments under this section may use the
35 moneys for, including but not limited to, the following:

40 within the district.
41 4. Nothing in this section shall be construed to
42 authorize a district in need, as such term is defined in
43 section 162.1400, to spend or transfer any state funds
44 except as authorized pursuant to the provisions of section
45 162.1402.
1 165.011. 1. The following funds are created for the
2 accounting of all school moneys: "Teachers' Fund",
3 "Incidental Fund", "Capital Projects Fund" and "Debt Service
4 Fund". The treasurer of the school district shall open an
SB 1059 17
5 account for each fund specified in this section, and all
6 moneys received from the county school fund and all moneys
7 derived from taxation for teachers' wages shall be placed to
8 the credit of the teachers' fund. All tuition fees, state
9 moneys received under section 163.031, and all other moneys
10 received from the state except as herein provided shall be
11 placed to the credit of the teachers' and incidental funds
12 at the discretion of the district board of education, except
13 as provided in subsection 5 of section 163.031. Money
14 received from other districts for transportation and money
15 derived from taxation for incidental expenses shall be
16 credited to the incidental fund. All money derived from
17 taxation or received from any other source for the erection
18 of buildings or additions thereto and the remodeling or
19 reconstruction of buildings and the furnishing thereof, for
20 the payment of lease-purchase obligations, for the purchase
21 of real estate, or from sale of real estate, schoolhouses or
22 other buildings of any kind, or school furniture, from
23 insurance, from sale of bonds other than refunding bonds
24 shall be placed to the credit of the capital projects fund.
25 All moneys derived from the sale or lease of sites,
26 buildings, facilities, furnishings, and equipment by a
27 school district as authorized under section 177.088 shall be
28 credited to the capital projects fund. Money derived from
29 taxation for the retirement of bonds and the payment of
30 interest thereon shall be credited to the debt service fund,
31 which shall be maintained as a separate bank account.
32 Receipts from delinquent taxes shall be allocated to the
33 several funds on the same basis as receipts from current
34 taxes, except that where the previous years' obligations of
35 the district would be affected by such distribution, the
36 delinquent taxes shall be distributed according to the tax
SB 1059 18
37 levies made for the years in which the obligations were
38 incurred. All refunds received shall be placed to the
39 credit of the fund from which the original expenditures were
40 made. Money donated to the school districts shall be placed
41 to the credit of the fund where it can be expended to meet
42 the purpose for which it was donated and accepted. Money
43 received from any other source whatsoever shall be placed to
44 the credit of the fund or funds designated by the board.
45 2. The school board may transfer any portion of the
46 unrestricted balance remaining in the incidental fund to the
47 teachers' fund. Any district that uses an incidental fund
48 transfer to pay for more than twenty-five percent of the
49 annual certificated compensation obligation of the district
50 and has an incidental fund balance on June thirtieth in any
51 year in excess of fifty percent of the combined incidental
52 teachers' fund expenditures for the fiscal year just ended
53 shall be required to transfer the excess from the incidental
54 fund to the teachers' fund. If a balance remains in the
55 debt service fund, after the total outstanding indebtedness
56 for which the fund was levied is paid, the board may
57 transfer the unexpended balance to the capital projects
58 fund. If a balance remains in the bond proceeds after
59 completion of the project for which the bonds were issued,
60 the balance shall be transferred from the incidental or
61 capital projects fund to the debt service fund. After
62 making all placements of interest otherwise provided by law,
63 a school district may transfer from the capital projects
64 fund to the incidental fund the interest earned from
65 undesignated balances in the capital projects fund. A
66 school district may borrow from one of the following funds:
67 teachers' fund, incidental fund, or capital projects fund,
68 as necessary to meet obligations in another of those funds;
SB 1059 19
69 provided that the full amount is repaid to the lending fund
70 within the same fiscal year.
71 3. Tuition shall be paid from either the teachers' or
72 incidental funds. Employee benefits for certificated staff
73 shall be paid from the teachers' fund.
74 4. Other provisions of law to the contrary
75 notwithstanding, the school board of a school district that
76 meets the provisions of subsection 5 of section 163.031 may
77 transfer from the incidental fund to the capital projects
78 fund the sum of:
79 (1) The amount to be expended for transportation
80 equipment that is considered an allowable cost under state
81 board of education rules for transportation reimbursements
82 during the current year; plus
83 (2) Any amount necessary to satisfy obligations of the
84 capital projects fund for state-approved area vocational-
85 technical schools; plus
86 (3) Current year obligations for lease-purchase
87 obligations entered into prior to January 1, 1997; plus
88 (4) The amount necessary to repay costs of one or more
89 guaranteed energy savings performance contracts to renovate
90 buildings in the school district, provided that the contract
91 is only for energy conservation measures as defined in
92 section 640.651 and provided that the contract specifies
93 that no payment or total of payments shall be required from
94 the school district until at least an equal total amount of
95 energy and energy-related operating savings and payments
96 from the vendor pursuant to the contract have been realized
97 by the school district; plus
98 (5) An amount not to exceed the greater of:
99 (a) One hundred sixty-two thousand three hundred
100 twenty-six dollars; or
SB 1059 20
101 (b) Seven percent of the state adequacy target
102 multiplied by the district's weighted average daily
103 attendance,
104 provided that transfer amounts in excess of current year
105 obligations of the capital projects fund authorized under
106 this subdivision may be transferred only by a resolution of
107 the school board approved by a majority of the board members
108 in office when the resolution is voted on and identifying
109 the specific capital projects to be funded directly by the
110 district by the transferred funds and an estimated
111 expenditure date.
112 5. Beginning in the 2006-07 school year, a district
113 meeting the provisions of subsection 5 of section 163.031
114 and not making the transfer under subdivision (5) of
115 subsection 4 of this section, nor making payments or
116 expenditures related to obligations made under section
117 177.088 may transfer from the incidental fund to the debt
118 service fund or the capital projects fund the greater of:
119 (1) The state aid received in the 2005-06 school year
120 as a result of no more than eighteen cents of the sum of the
121 debt service and capital projects levy used in the
122 foundation formula and placed in the respective debt service
123 or capital projects fund, whichever fund had the designated
124 tax levy; or
125 (2) Five percent of the state adequacy target
126 multiplied by the district's weighted average daily
127 attendance.
128 6. Beginning in the 2006-07 school year, the
129 department of elementary and secondary education shall
130 deduct from a school district's state aid calculated
131 pursuant to section 163.031 an amount equal to the amount of
SB 1059 21
132 any transfer of funds from the incidental fund to the
133 capital projects fund or debt service fund performed during
134 the previous year in violation of this section; except that
135 the state aid shall be deducted over no more than five
136 school years following the school year of an unlawful
137 transfer based on a plan from the district approved by the
138 commissioner of elementary and secondary education.
139 7. A school district may transfer unrestricted funds
140 from the capital projects fund to the incidental fund in any
141 year to avoid becoming financially stressed as defined in
142 subsection 1 of section 161.520. If on June thirtieth of
143 any fiscal year the sum of unrestricted balances in a school
144 district's incidental fund and teacher's fund is less than
145 twenty percent of the sum of the school district's
146 expenditures from those funds for the fiscal year ending on
147 that June thirtieth, the school district may, during the
148 next succeeding fiscal year, transfer to its incidental fund
149 an amount up to and including the amount of the unrestricted
150 balance in its capital projects fund on that June
151 thirtieth. For purposes of this subsection, in addition to
152 any other restrictions that may apply to funds in the school
153 district's capital projects fund, any funds that are derived
154 from the proceeds of one or more general obligation bond
155 issues shall be considered restricted funds and shall not be
156 transferred to the school district's incidental fund.
157 8. Nothing in this section shall be construed to
158 authorize a district in need, as such term is defined in
159 section 162.1400, to spend or transfer any state funds
160 except as authorized pursuant to the provisions of section
161 162.1402.
1 165.051. If any school district has money in the
2 teachers', incidental, capital projects or debt service fund
SB 1059 22
3 not needed within a reasonable period of time for the
4 purpose for which the money was received, the school board
5 in the district, if it deems it advisable, may invest the
6 funds in either open time deposits or certificates of
7 deposit secured under the provisions of sections 110.010 and
8 110.020; or in bonds, redeemable at maturity at par, of the
9 state of Missouri, of the United States, or of any wholly
10 owned corporation of the United States; or in other short
11 term obligations of the United States, or in any instrument
12 permitted by law for the investment of state moneys. No
13 open time deposits shall be made or bonds purchased to
14 mature beyond the date that the funds are needed for the
15 purpose for which they were received by the school
16 district. Interest accruing from the investment of the
17 surplus funds in such deposits or bonds shall be credited to
18 the fund from which the money was invested. Nothing in this
19 section shall be construed to authorize a district in need,
20 as such term is defined in section 162.1400, to spend or
21 transfer any state funds except as authorized pursuant to
22 the provisions of section 162.1402.
