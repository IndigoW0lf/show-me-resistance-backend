AN ACT
To repeal section 287.067, RSMo, and to enact in lieu thereof two new sections relating to
workers' compensation for certain first responders.
Be it enacted by the General Assembly of the state of Missouri, as follows:
Section A. Section 287.067, RSMo, is repealed and two new sections enacted in lieu
2 thereof, to be known as sections 287.067 and 287.068, to read as follows:
287.067. 1. (1) In this chapter the term "occupational disease" is hereby defined to
2 mean, unless a different meaning is clearly indicated by the context, an identifiable disease
3 arising with or without human fault out of and in the course of the employment. Ordinary
4 diseases of life to which the general public is exposed outside of the employment shall not be
5 compensable, except where the diseases follow as an incident of an occupational disease as
6 defined in this section. The disease need not to have been foreseen or expected but after its
7 contraction it must appear to have had its origin in a risk connected with the employment and
8 to have flowed from that source as a rational consequence.
9 (2) For the purposes of this section, the term "hazardous duty" has the same
10 meaning given to such term under 5 CFR 550.902.
11 2. An injury ordeath by occupational disease is compensableonly if the occupational
12 exposure was the prevailing factor in causing both the resulting medical condition and
13 disability. The "prevailing factor" is defined to be the primary factor, in relation to any other
14 factor, causing both the resulting medical condition and disability. Ordinary, gradual
15 deterioration, or progressive degeneration of the body caused by aging or by the normal
16 activities of day-to-day living shall not be compensable.
EXPLANATION â€” Matter enclosed in bold-faced brackets [thus] in the above bill is not enacted and is
intended to be omitted from the law. Matter in bold-face type in the above bill is proposed language.
HB 2817 2
17 3. An injury due to repetitive motion is recognized as an occupational disease for
18 purposes of this chapter. An occupational disease due to repetitive motion is compensable
19 only if the occupational exposure was the prevailing factor in causing both the resulting
20 medical condition and disability. The "prevailing factor" is defined to be the primary factor,
21 in relation to any other factor, causing both the resulting medical condition and disability.
22 Ordinary, gradual deterioration, or progressive degeneration of the body caused by aging or
23 by the normal activities of day-to-day living shall not be compensable.
24 4. "Loss of hearing due to industrial noise" is recognized as an occupational disease
25 for purposes of this chapter and is hereby defined to be a loss of hearing in one or both ears
26 due to prolonged exposure to harmful noise in employment. "Harmful noise" means sound
27 capable of producing occupational deafness.
28 5. "Radiation disability" is recognized as an occupational disease for purposes of this
29 chapter and is hereby defined to be that disability due to radioactive properties or substances
30 or to Roentgen rays (X-rays) or exposure to ionizing radiation caused by any process
31 involving the use of or direct contact with radium or radioactive properties or substances or
32 the use of or direct exposure to Roentgen rays (X-rays) or ionizing radiation.
33 6. (1) Disease of the lungs or respiratory tract[,]; diseases of the heart or
34 cardiovascular system including, but not limited to, diseases of the blood or bone
35 marrow, hypotension, and hypertension[, or disease of the heart or cardiovascular system,
36 including]; and diseases of the body systems or organs from carcinoma[,] may be
37 recognized as occupational diseases for the purposes of this chapter and are defined to be
38 disability due to exposure to smoke, gases, carcinogens, or inadequate oxygen[,] of paid or
39 volunteer firefighters, firefighter paramedics, or firefighter emergency medical
40 technicians of a [paid] fire department or fire district or paid police officers of a paid
41 police department certified under chapter 590 [if a direct causal relationship is established,
42 or].
43 (2) For purposes of this chapter, psychological stress and mental disorders may
44 be recognized as occupational diseases of paid, volunteer, or retiredfirefighters [of a paid
45 fire department], paramedics, or emergency medical technicians, or paid peace officers of
46 a police department who are certified under chapter 590 [if a direct causal relationship is
47 established]. Such psychological stress and mental disorders shall be defined to be
48 disability due to stressful exposures if such psychological stress and mental disorders
49 arise from their employment.
50 7. (1) Any infectious disease; disease of the lungs or respiratory tract; disease of
51 the heart or cardiovascular system including, but not limited to, disease of the blood or
52 bone marrow, hypotension, and hypertension; or disease of the body systems or organs
53 from carcinoma contracted by a paid, volunteer, or retired firefighter, paramedic, or

54 emergencymedicaltechnicianshallbepresumedtobeanoccupationaldiseaseifthereis
55 reasonable medical evidence that the paid, volunteer, or retired firefighter, paramedic,
56 or emergency medical technician was free of such disease at the beginning of his or her
57 employment. It shall be the duty of the employer of the paid, volunteer, or retired
58 firefighter, paramedic, or emergency medical technician to provide such reasonable
59 medical evidence.
60 (2) If the employer fails to produce such reasonable medical evidence, the paid,
61 volunteer, or retired firefighter, paramedic, or emergency medical technician shall have
62 the benefit of the presumption regardless of the absence of reasonable medical evidence.
63 (3) This subsection shall apply to paid, volunteer, and retired firefighters,

70 severe acute respiratory syndrome.
71 8. (1) Asusedinthissection,"psychologicalstress"and"mentaldisorder"shall
72 be presumed to be occupational diseases that were contracted in the course and scope of
73 employment, regardless of whether their onset is sudden or gradual, if such
74 "psychological stress" or "mental disorder" requires medical services or results in
75 physical or mental disability, diagnosed by a psychiatrist or psychologist, of a paid,
76 volunteer, or retired firefighter, paramedic, or emergency medical technician or of a
77 paid police officer of a paid police department certified under chapter 590.

94 result from exposure to heat absorption, inhalation, ingestion, or radiation, contracted
95 by a paid, volunteer, or retired firefighter, firefighter paramedic, or firefighter
96 emergency medical technician. References to "the body systems or organs from
97 carcinoma" shall be presumed to be references to cancer and an occupational disease if:
98 (1) The paid, volunteer, or retired firefighter, firefighter paramedic, or
99 firefighter emergency medical technician has been assigned to at least five years of
100 hazardous duty as a firefighter, firefighter paramedic, or firefighter emergency medical
101 technician;
102 (2) The paid, volunteer, or retired firefighter, firefighter paramedic, or
103 firefighter emergency medical technician was exposed to an agent, whether known or
104 unknown, classified by the International Agency for Research on Cancer, or any
105 successor organization, as a group 1 or 2A carcinogen or classified as a cancer-causing
106 agent by the American Cancer Society, the American Association for Cancer Research,
107 the Agency for Healthcare Research and Quality, the American Society of Clinical
108 Oncology, the National Institute for Occupational Safety and Health, or the United
109 States National Cancer Institute;

117 if:
118 (1) There is evidence that the exposure to personal use of cigarettes, tobacco
119 products, or other conditions presenting an extremely high risk for the development of
120 the cancer was, more likely than not, the prevailing factor in the cause of progression of
121 the cancer, and such exposure occurred outside the scope of employment as a paid,
122 volunteer, or retired firefighter, firefighter paramedic, or firefighter emergency medical
123 technician; or
124 (2) There is evidence that the paid, volunteer, or retired firefighter, firefighter
125 paramedic, or firefighter emergency medical technician developed the type of cancer
126 alleged before becoming a member of the fire department or fire district.
HB 2817 5
127 12. The presumption described in subsection 8 of this section shall be rebuttable
128 if:
129 (1) There is evidence that the condition existed prior to the commencement of
130 the employment;
131 (2) The prevailing factor in causing such condition is unrelated to the
132 employment; or
133 (3) The prevailing factor in causing such condition is from exposures occurring
134 outside the scope of the employment.
135 13. Any employee who is exposed to and contracts any contagious or communicable
136 disease arising out of and in the course of his or her employment shall be eligible for benefits
137 under this chapter as an occupational disease.
138 [8.] 14. With regard to occupational disease due to repetitive motion, if the exposure
139 totherepetitivemotionwhichisfoundtobethecauseofthe injuryisfora periodoflessthan
140 three months and the evidence demonstrates that the exposure to the repetitive motion with
141 the immediate prior employer was the prevailing factor in causing the injury, the prior
142 employer shall be liable for such occupational disease.
143 [9.] 15. (1) (a) Posttraumatic stress disorder (PTSD), as described in the Diagnostic
144 and Statistical Manual of Mental Health Disorders, Fifth Edition, published by the American
145 Psychiatric Association, (DSM-5) is recognized as a compensable occupational disease for
146 purposes of this chapter when diagnosed in a first responder, as that term is defined under
147 section 67.145.
148 (b) Benefits payable to a first responder under this section shall not require a physical
149 injury to the first responder, and are not subject to any preexisting PTSD.

151 demonstrated by clear and convincing evidence that PTSD has resulted from the course and
152 scope of employment, and the first responder is examined and diagnosed with PTSD by an
153 authorized treating physician, due to the first responder experiencing one of the following
154 qualifying events:
155 a. Seeing for oneself a deceased minor;
156 b. Witnessing directly the death of a minor;
157 c. Witnessing directly the injury to a minor who subsequently died prior to or upon
158 arrival at a hospital emergency department, participating in the physical treatment of, or
159 manually transporting, an injured minor who subsequently died prior to or upon arrival at a
160 hospital emergency department;
161 d. Seeing for oneself a person who has suffered serious physical injury of a nature
162 that shocks the conscience;

167 physical injury that shocks the conscience;
168 g. Participating in the physical treatment of an injury, including attempted suicide, or
169 manually transporting an injured person who suffered serious physical injury, if the injured
170 person subsequently died prior to or upon arrival at a hospital emergency department; or
171 h. Involvement in an event that caused or may have caused serious injury or harm to
172 the first responder or had the potential to cause the death of the first responder, whether
173 accidental or by an intentional act of another individual.
174 (2) The time for notice of injury or death in cases of compensable PTSD under this
175 section is measured from exposure to one of the qualifying stressors listed in the DSM-5
176 criteria, or the diagnosis of the disorder, whichever is later. Any claim for compensation for
177 such injury shall be properly noticed within fifty-two weeks after the qualifying exposure, or
178 the diagnosis of the disorder, whichever is later.
