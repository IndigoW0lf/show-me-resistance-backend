24 action under section 571.015, or has committed two or more
25 prior unrelated offenses which would be felonies if
26 committed by an adult, the court shall order a hearing, and
27 may in its discretion, dismiss the petition and transfer the
28 child to a court of general jurisdiction for prosecution
29 under the general law.
30 2. Before the court holds a hearing authorized under
31 subsection 1 of this section to determine if a child should
32 be transferred to the court of general jurisdiction and
33 prosecuted under the general law, the court shall hold an
34 evidentiary probable cause hearing to determine if probable
35 cause exists to proceed with the allegations contained in
36 the petition. The probable cause hearing shall be held
37 after the detention hearing but before the hearing under
38 subsection 1 of this section. The juvenile officer shall
39 have the burden of proving probable cause to proceed by a
40 preponderance of the evidence, and the juvenile shall have
41 the right to testify, present evidence, cross-examine
42 witnesses, and present arguments of law and fact with
43 respect to the issue of probable cause.
44 3. Upon apprehension and arrest, jurisdiction over the
45 criminal offense allegedly committed by any person between
46 eighteen and twenty-one years of age over whom the juvenile
47 court has retained continuing jurisdiction shall
48 automatically terminate and that offense shall be dealt with
SB 1229 3
49 in the court of general jurisdiction as provided in section
50 211.041.
51 [3.] 4. Knowing and willful age misrepresentation by a
52 juvenile subject shall not affect any action or proceeding
53 which occurs based upon the misrepresentation. Any evidence
54 obtained during the period of time in which a child
55 misrepresents his or her age may be used against the child
56 and will be subject only to rules of evidence applicable in
57 adult proceedings.
58 [4.] 5. Written notification of a transfer hearing
59 shall be given to the juvenile and his or her custodian in
60 the same manner as provided in sections 211.101 and
61 211.111. Notice of the hearing may be waived by the
62 custodian. Notice shall contain a statement that the
63 purpose of the hearing is to determine whether the child is
64 a proper subject to be dealt with under the provisions of
65 this chapter, and that if the court finds that the child is
66 not a proper subject to be dealt with under the provisions
67 of this chapter, the petition will be dismissed to allow for
68 prosecution of the child under the general law.
69 [5.] 6. The juvenile officer may consult with the
70 office of prosecuting attorney concerning any offense for
71 which the child could be certified as an adult under this
72 section. The prosecuting or circuit attorney shall have
73 access to police reports, reports of the juvenile or deputy
74 juvenile officer, statements of witnesses and all other
75 records or reports relating to the offense alleged to have
76 been committed by the child. The prosecuting or circuit
77 attorney shall have access to the disposition records of the
78 child when the child has been adjudicated pursuant to
79 subdivision (3) of subsection 1 of section 211.031. The
80 prosecuting attorney shall not divulge any information
SB 1229 4
81 regarding the child and the offense until the juvenile court
82 at a judicial hearing has determined that the child is not a
83 proper subject to be dealt with under the provisions of this
84 chapter.
85 [6.] 7. A written report shall be prepared in
86 accordance with this chapter developing fully all available
87 information relevant to the criteria which shall be
88 considered by the court in determining whether the child is
89 a proper subject to be dealt with under the provisions of
90 this chapter and whether there are reasonable prospects of
91 rehabilitation within the juvenile justice system. These
92 criteria shall include but not be limited to:
93 (1) The seriousness of the offense alleged and whether
94 the protection of the community requires transfer to the
95 court of general jurisdiction;
96 (2) Whether the offense alleged involved viciousness,
97 force and violence;
98 (3) Whether the offense alleged was against persons or
99 property with greater weight being given to the offense
100 against persons, especially if personal injury resulted;
101 (4) Whether the offense alleged is a part of a
102 repetitive pattern of offenses which indicates that the
103 child may be beyond rehabilitation under the juvenile code;
104 (5) The record and history of the child, including
105 experience with the juvenile justice system, other courts,
106 supervision, commitments to juvenile institutions and other
107 placements;
108 (6) The sophistication and maturity of the child as
109 determined by consideration of his or her home and
110 environmental situation, emotional condition and pattern of
111 living;
112 (7) The age of the child;
SB 1229 5
113 (8) The program and facilities available to the
114 juvenile court in considering disposition;
115 (9) Whether or not the child can benefit from the
116 treatment or rehabilitative programs available to the
117 juvenile court; and
118 (10) Racial disparity in certification.
119 [7.] 8. If the court dismisses the petition to permit
120 the child to be prosecuted under the general law, the court
121 shall enter a dismissal order containing:
122 (1) Findings showing that the court had jurisdiction
123 of the cause and of the parties;
124 (2) Findings showing that the child was represented by
125 counsel;
126 (3) Findings showing that the hearing was held in the
127 presence of the child and his or her counsel; [and]
128 (4) Findings, based on evidence adduced by the
129 juvenile officer and the child at the evidentiary probable
130 cause hearing, showing that probable cause exists to proceed
131 with the allegations contained in the petition; and
132 (5) Findings showing the reasons underlying the
133 court's decision to transfer jurisdiction.
134 [8.] 9. A copy of the petition and order of the
135 dismissal shall be sent to the prosecuting attorney.
136 [9.] 10. When a petition has been dismissed thereby
137 permitting a child to be prosecuted under the general law
138 and the prosecution of the child results in a conviction,
139 the jurisdiction of the juvenile court over that child is
140 forever terminated, except as provided in subsection [10] 11
141 of this section, for an act that would be a violation of a
142 state law or municipal ordinance.
143 [10.] 11. If a petition has been dismissed thereby
144 permitting a child to be prosecuted under the general law
SB 1229 6
145 and the child is found not guilty by a court of general
146 jurisdiction, the juvenile court shall have jurisdiction
147 over any later offense committed by that child which would
148 be considered a misdemeanor or felony if committed by an
149 adult, subject to the certification provisions of this
150 section.
151 [11.] 12. If the court does not dismiss the petition
152 to permit the child to be prosecuted under the general law,
