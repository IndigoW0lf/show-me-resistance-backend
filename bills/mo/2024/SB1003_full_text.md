12 secretary of state pursuant to this chapter on or before
13 5:00 p.m. on the final day for filing petitions with the
14 secretary of state shall not be counted. A petition
15 circulator shall be deemed registered at the time such
16 circulator delivers a signed circulator's affidavit pursuant

23 laws of any other jurisdiction if that offense would be
24 considered forgery under the laws of this state.
25 2. Each petition circulator shall subscribe and swear
26 to the proper affidavit on each petition page such
27 circulator submits before a notary public commissioned in

35 affidavit knowing it to be false is guilty of a class A
36 misdemeanor punishable, notwithstanding the provisions of
37 section 560.021 to the contrary, for a term of imprisonment
38 not to exceed one year in the county jail or a fine not to
39 exceed ten thousand dollars or both.
