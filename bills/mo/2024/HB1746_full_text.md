83 8. This section is intended for the specific and unique purpose of determining the
84 ratemaking rate base of small water utilities and shall be exclusively applied to large water
85 public utilities in the acquisition of a small water utility. This section is not intended to apply
86 beyond its specific purpose and shall not be construed in any manner to apply to electric
87 corporations, natural gas corporations, or any other utility regulated by the public service
88 commission.
393.1030. 1. Thecommissionshall,inconsultationwiththedepartment,prescribeby
2 rule a portfolio requirement for all electric utilities to generate or purchase electricity
3 generated from renewable energy resources. Such portfolio requirement shall provide that
4 electricity from renewable energy resources shall constitute the following portions of each
5 electric utility's sales:
6 (1) No less than two percent for calendar years 2011 through 2013;
7 (2) No less than five percent for calendar years 2014 through 2017;
8 (3) No less than ten percent for calendar years 2018 through 2020; and
9 (4) No less than fifteen percent in each calendar year beginning in 2021.
10
11 At least two percent of each portfolio requirement shall be derived from solar energy. The
12 portfolio requirements shall apply to all power sold to Missouri consumers whether such
13 power is self-generated or purchased from another source in or outside of this state. A utility
14 maycomplywiththestandardinwholeorinpartbypurchasingRECs. Eachkilowatt-hourof
HB 1746 12
15 eligible energy generated in Missouri shall count as 1.25 kilowatt-hours for purposes of
16 compliance.
17 2. (1) This subsection applies to electric utilities with more than two hundred
18 fifty thousand but less than one million retail customers in Missouri as of the end of
19 calendar year 2022.
20 (2) Energy meeting the criteria of the renewable energy portfolio requirements
21 set forth in subsection 1 of this section that is generated from renewable energy
22 resources and contracted for by an accelerated renewable buyer shall:
23 (a) Have all associated renewable energy certificates retired by the accelerated
24 renewable buyer, or on their behalf, and the certificates shall not be used to meet the
25 electric utility's portfolio requirements pursuant to subsection 1 of this section;
26 (b) Be excluded from the total electric utility's sales used to determine the
27 portfolio requirements pursuant to subsection 1 of this section; and
28 (c) Be used to offset all or a portion of its electric load for purposes of
29 determiningcompliancewith theportfoliorequirements pursuanttosubsection 1 ofthis
30 section.
31 (3) Theacceleratedrenewablebuyershallbeexemptfromanyrenewableenergy
32 standard compliance costs as may be established by the utility and approved by the
33 commission, based on the amount of renewable energy certificates retired pursuant to
34 this subsection in proportion to the accelerated renewable buyer's total electric energy
35 consumption, on an annual basis.
36 (4) An "accelerated renewable buyer" means a customer of an electric utility,
37 with an aggregate load over eighty average megawatts, that enters into a contract or
38 contracts to obtain:
39 (a) Renewable energy certificates fromrenewable energy resources as defined in
40 section 393.1025; or
41 (b) Energy and renewable energy certificates from solar or wind generation
42 resources located within the Southwest Power Pool or Midcontinent Independent
43 System Operator regions and initially placed in commercial operation after January 1,
44 2020, including any contract with the electric utility for such generation resources that
45 does not allocate to or recover from any other customer of the utility the cost of such
46 resources.
47 (5) Each electric utility shall certify, and verify as necessary, to the commission
48 that the accelerated renewable buyer has satisfied the exemption requirements of this
49 subsection for each year, or an accelerated renewable buyer may choose to certify
50 satisfaction of this exemption by reporting to the commission individually. The
51 commission may promulgate such rules and regulations as may be necessary to
HB 1746 13
52 implement the provisions of this subsection. Nothing in this section shall be construed
53 as imposing or authorizing the imposition of any reporting, regulatory, or financial
54 burden on an accelerated renewable buyer.
55 3. The commission, in consultation with the department and within one year of
56 November 4, 2008, shall select a program for tracking and verifying the trading of renewable
57 energy credits. An unused credit may exist for up to three years from the date of its creation.
58 A credit may be used only once to comply with sections 393.1020 to 393.1030 and may not
59 also be used to satisfy any similar nonfederal requirement. An electric utility may not use a
60 credit derived from a green pricing program. Certificates from net-metered sources shall
61 initially be owned by the customer-generator. The commission, except where the department
62 is specified, shall make whatever rules are necessary to enforce the renewable energy
63 standard. Such rules shall include:
64 (1) A maximum average retail rate increase of one percent determined by estimating
65 and comparing the electric utility's cost of compliance with least-cost renewable generation
66 and the cost of continuing to generate or purchase electricity from entirely nonrenewable
67 sources, taking into proper account future environmental regulatory risk including the risk of
68 greenhouse gas regulation. Notwithstanding the foregoing, until June 30, 2020, if the
69 maximum average retail rate increase would be less than or equal to one percent if an electric
70 utility's investment in solar-related projects initiated, owned or operated by the electric utility
71 is ignored for purposes of calculating the increase, then additional solar rebates shall be paid
72 and included in rates in an amount up to the amount that would produce a retail rate increase
73 equal to the difference between a one percent retail rate increase and the retail rate increase
74 calculated when ignoring an electric utility's investment in solar-related projects initiated,
75 owned, or operated by the electric utility. Notwithstanding any provision to the contrary in
76 this section, even if the payment of additional solar rebates will produce a maximum average
77 retail rate increase of greater than one percent when an electric utility's investment in solar-
78 related projects initiated, owned or operated by the electric utility are included in the
79 calculation, the additional solar rebate costs shall be included in the prudently incurred costs
80 to be recovered as contemplated by subdivision (4) of this subsection;
81 (2) Penalties of at least twice the average market value of renewable energy credits
82 for the compliance period for failure to meet the targets of subsection 1 of this section. An
83 electric utility will be excused if it proves to the commission that failure was due to events
84 beyond its reasonable control that could not have been reasonably mitigated, or that the
85 maximumaverageretailrateincreasehasbeenreached. Penaltiesshallnotberecoveredfrom
86 customers. Amounts forfeited under this section shall be remitted to the department to
87 purchase renewable energy credits needed for compliance. Any excess forfeited revenues
HB 1746 14
88 shall be used by the division of energy solely for renewable energy and energy efficiency
89 projects;
90 (3) Provisions for an annual report to be filed by each electric utility in a format
91 sufficient to document its progress in meeting the targets;
92 (4) Provision for recovery outside the context of a regular rate case of prudently
93 incurred costs and the pass-through of benefits to customers of any savings achieved by an
94 electrical corporation in meeting the requirements of this section.
95 [3.] 4. As provided for in this section, except for those electrical corporations that
96 qualify for an exemption under section 393.1050, each electric utility shall make available to
97 its retail customers a solar rebate for new or expanded solar electric systems sited on
98 customers' premises, up to a maximum of twenty-five kilowatts per system, measured in
99 direct current that were confirmed by the electric utility to have become operational in
100 compliance with the provisions of section 386.890. The solar rebates shall be two dollars per
101 watt for systems becoming operational on or before June 30, 2014; one dollar and fifty cents
102 per watt for systems becoming operational between July 1, 2014, and June 30, 2015; one
103 dollar per watt for systems becoming operational between July 1, 2015, and June 30, 2016;
104 fifty cents per watt for systems becoming operational between July 1, 2016, and June 30,
105 2017; fifty cents per watt for systems becoming operational between July 1, 2017, and June
106 30, 2019; twenty-five cents per watt for systems becoming operational between July 1, 2019,
107 and June 30, 2020; and zero cents per watt for systems becoming operational after June 30,
108 2020. An electric utility may, through its tariffs, require applications for rebates to be
109 submitted up to one hundred eighty-two days prior to the June thirtieth operational date.
110 Nothing in this section shall prevent an electrical corporation from offering rebates after July
111 1, 2020, through an approved tariff. If the electric utility determines the maximum average
112 retail rate increase provided for in subdivision (1) of subsection [2] 3 of this section will be
113 reachedinanycalendaryear,theelectricutility shallbeentitledtoceasepayingrebatestothe
114 extent necessary to avoid exceeding the maximum average retail rate increase if the electrical
115 corporation files with the commission to suspend its rebate tariff for the remainder of that
116 calendar year at least sixty days prior to the change taking effect. The filing with the
117 commission to suspend the electrical corporation's rebate tariff shall include the calculation
118 reflecting that the maximum average retail rate increase will be reached and supporting
119 documentation reflecting that the maximum average retail rate increase will be reached. The
120 commission shall rule on the suspension filing within sixty days of the date it is filed. If the
121 commission determines that the maximum average retail rate increase will be reached, the
122 commission shall approve the tariff suspension. The electric utility shall continue to process
123 and pay applicable solar rebates until a final commission ruling; however, if the continued
124 paymentcausestheelectricutilitytopayrebatesthatcauseittoexceedthemaximumaverage
HB 1746 15
125 retail rate increase, the expenditures shall be considered prudently incurred costs as
126 contemplatedby subdivision(4)ofsubsection[2] 3ofthis sectionandshall berecoverableas
127 such by the electric utility. As a condition of receiving a rebate, customers shall transfer to
128 the electric utility all right, title, and interest in and to the renewable energy credits associated
129 withthe new orexpanded solar electric system thatqualified the customer for the solar rebate
130 for a period of ten years from the date the electric utility confirmed that the solar electric
131 system was installed and operational.
132 [4.] 5. The department shall, in consultation with the commission, establish by rule a
133 certification process for electricity generated from renewable resources and used to fulfill the
134 requirements of subsection 1 of this section. Certification criteria for renewable energy
135 generation shall be determined by factors that include fuel type, technology, and the
136 environmental impacts of the generating facility. Renewable energy facilities shall not cause
137 undueadverse air, water, orland use impacts,including impactsassociated with the gathering
138 of generation feedstocks. If any amount of fossil fuel is used with renewable energy
139 resources, only the portion of electrical output attributable to renewable energy resources
140 shall be used to fulfill the portfolio requirements.
141 [5.] 6. In carrying out the provisions of this section, the commission and the
142 department shall include methane generated from the anaerobic digestion of farm animal
143 waste and thermal depolymerization or pyrolysis for converting waste material to energy as
144 renewable energy resources for purposes of this section.
145 [6.] 7. The commission shall have the authority to promulgate rules for the
146 implementation of this section, but only to the extent such rules are consistent with, and do
147 not delay the implementation of, the provisions of this section. Any rule or portion of a rule,
148 as that term is defined in section 536.010, that is created under the authority delegated in this
149 sectionshallbecomeeffectiveonlyifitcomplieswithandissubjecttoalloftheprovisionsof
150 chapter 536 and, if applicable, section 536.028. This section and chapter 536 are
151 nonseverable and if any of the powers vested with the general assembly pursuant to chapter
152 536 to review, to delay the effective date, or to disapprove and annul a rule are subsequently
153 held unconstitutional, then the grant of rulemaking authority and any rule proposed or
154 adopted after August 28, 2013, shall be invalid and void.
393.1506. 1. Notwithstanding any provisions of chapter 386 and this chapter to the
2 contrary, a water or sewer corporation that provides water [or sewer] service to more than
3 eight thousand customer connections, sewer service to more than eight thousand customer
4 connections, or a combination of either to more than eight thousand customer
5 connections may file a petition and proposed rate schedules with the commission to establish
6 or change a WSIRA that will provide for the recovery of the appropriate pretax revenues
7 associated with the eligible infrastructure system projects, less the appropriate pretax
HB 1746 16
8 revenues associated with any retired utility plant that is being replaced by the eligible
9 infrastructure system projects. The WSIRA shall not produce revenues in excess of fifteen
10 percent of the water or sewer corporation's base revenue requirement approved by the
11 commission in the water or sewer corporation's most recent general rate proceeding;
12 provided, however, that neither WSIRA revenues attributable to replacement of customer-
13 owned lead service lines, nor any reconciliation amounts described in subdivision (2) of
14 subsection 5 of section 393.1509, shall count toward the program cap. The WSIRA and any
15 future changes thereto shall be calculated and implemented in accordance with the provisions
16 of sections 393.1503 to 393.1509. WSIRA revenues shall be subject to refund based upon a
17 finding and order of the commission, to the extent provided in subsections 5 and 8 of section
18 393.1509.
19 2. The commission shall not approve a WSIRA for a water or sewer corporation that
20 hasnothadageneralrateproceedingdecidedordismissedbyissuanceofacommissionorder
21 within the past three years of the filing of a petition pursuant to this section unless the water
22 or sewer corporation has filed for or is the subject of a new general rate proceeding.
23 3. In no event shall a water or sewer corporation collect a WSIRA for a period
24 exceeding three years unless the water or sewer corporation has filed for or is the subject of a
25 pending general rate proceeding; provided that the WSIRA may be collected until the
26 effective date of new rate schedules established as a result of the new general rate proceeding
27 oruntil the subject general rate proceeding isotherwise decidedor dismissed by issuanceof a
28 commission order without new rates being established.
29 4. Except as provided in this subsection, in no event shall a water or sewer
30 corporation collect a WSIRA if also collecting revenues from a commission approved
31 infrastructuresystemreplacementsurchargeasprovidedinsections393.1000to393.1006. In
32 no event shall a customer be charged both an infrastructure system replacement surcharge as
33 provided in sections 393.1000 to 393.1006 and a WSIRA. In the event a water or sewer
34 corporation is collecting infrastructure system replacement surchargerevenues under sections
35 393.1000 to 393.1006, that was approved prior to August 28, 2021, when the initial WSIRA
36 is filed, the approved infrastructure system replacement surcharge revenues shall be included
37 in the new WSIRA filing.
393.1645. 1. Subject to the limitations provided for in subsection 2 of this
2 section, and upon proper application by an eligible customer prior to public
3 announcement of a growth project, a new or existing account meeting the criteria in
4 this subsection shall qualify for one of the discounts set forth in subdivision (1) or (2) of
5 this subsection:
6 (1) When the customer is a new customer and the new load is reasonably
7 projected to be at least two hundred seventy thousand ccf annually, the discount shall

8 equaluptotwenty-fivepercentsubjecttothelimitingprovisionsofthissectionandshall
9 apply for four years; or
10 (2) When the customer is an existing customer and the new load is reasonably
11 projected to be at least one hundredthirty-five thousand ccf annually, the discount shall
12 equal twenty-five percent subject to the limiting provisions of this section and shall
13 apply for four years.
14
15 To obtain one of the discounts set forth in subdivision (1) or (2) of this subsection, the
16 customer's load shall be incremental, net of any offsetting load reductions due to the
17 termination of other accounts of the customer or an affiliate of the customer within
18 twelve months priorto the commencement of service to thenew load, thecustomer shall
19 receive an economic development incentive from the local, regional, state, or federal
20 government, or from an agency or program of any such government, in conjunction
21 with the incremental load, and the customer shall meet the criteria set forth in the gas
22 corporation's economic development rider tariff sheet, as approved by the commission,
23 that are not inconsistent with the provisions of this subsection. Unless otherwise
24 provided for by the gas corporation's tariff, the applicable discount shall be a
25 percentage applied to all variable base-rate components of the bill. The discount shall
26 beappliedtosuchincrementalloadfromthedatewhenthemeterhasbeenpermanently
27 set until the date that such incremental load no longer meets the criteria required to
28 qualify for the discount as determined under the provisions of subsection 2 of this
29 section, or a maximum of four years. The gas corporation may include in its tariff
30 additionaloralternativetermsandconditionstoacustomer'sutilizationofthediscount,
31 subject to approval of such terms and conditions by the commission. The customer, on
32 forms supplied by the gas corporation, shall apply for the applicable discount provided
33 for by this subsection at least ninety days prior to the date the customer requests that
34 the incremental usage receive one of the discounts provided for by this subsection and
35 shall enter into a written agreement with the gas corporation reflecting the discount
36 percentages and other pertinent details prior to which no discount will be available. If
37 the incremental usage is not separately metered, the gas corporation's determination of
38 the incremental usage shall control. The gas corporation shall verify the customer's
39 consumption annually to determine continued qualification for the applicable discount.
40 Notwithstandingtheforegoingprovisionsofthissubsection,thecents-per-ccfrealization
41 resulting from application of any discounted rates as calculated shall be higher than the
42 gas corporation's variable cost to serve such incremental usage and the applicable
43 discounted rate also shall make a positive contribution to fixed costs associated with
44 service to such incremental usage. If in a subsequent general rate proceeding the
HB 1746 18
45 commissiondeterminesthatapplicationofadiscountedrateisnotadequatetocoverthe
46 gas corporation's variable cost to serve accounts in question and provide a positive
47 contribution to fixed costs then the commission shall reduce the discount for those
48 accounts prospectively to the extent necessary to do so.
49 2. In each general rate proceeding concluded after August 28, 2024, the
50 difference in revenues generated by applying the discounted rates provided for by this
51 section and the revenues that would have been generated without such discounts shall
52 not be imputed into the gas corporation's revenue requirement, but instead such
53 revenue requirement shall be set using the revenues generated by such discounted rates,
54 and the impact of the discounts provided for by this section shall be allocated to all the
55 gas corporation's customer classes, including the classes with customers that qualify for
56 discounts under this section, through the application of a uniform percentage
57 adjustment to the revenue requirement responsibility of all customer classes. To
58 qualify for the discounted rates provided for in this section, customers shall meet the
59 applicable criteria within twenty-four months of initially receiving discounts based on
60 metering data for calendar months thirteen through twenty-four and annually
61 thereafter. If such data indicates that the customer did not meet the applicable
62 criteria for any subsequent twelve-month period, the customer shall thereafter no
63 longer qualify for a discounted rate. Customer usage existing at the time the customer
64 makes application for discounted rates under this section shall not constitute
65 incremental usage. The discounted rates provided for by this section apply only to
66 variable base-rate components, with charges or credits arising from any rate
67 adjustment mechanism authorized by law to be applied to customers qualifying for
68 discounted rates under this section in the same manner as such rate adjustments would
69 apply in the absence of this section.

116 subject to a separate commission order or proceeding relating to such retirement or
117 abandonment as contemplated by subdivision (2) of this subsection, and a description of the
118 order or other proceeding;
119 (b) The energy transition costs;
HB 1746 22
120 (c) An indicator of whether the electrical corporation proposes to finance all or a
121 portion of the energy transition costs using securitized utility tariff bonds. If the electrical
122 corporation proposes to finance a portion of the costs, the electrical corporation shall identify
123 the specific portion in the petition. By electing not to finance all or any portion of such
124 energy transition costs using securitized utility tariff bonds, an electrical corporation shall not
125 be deemed to waive its right to recover such costs pursuant to a separate proceeding with the
126 commission;
127 (d) An estimate of the financing costs related to the securitized utility tariff bonds;
128 (e) An estimate of the securitized utility tariff charges necessary to recover the
129 securitized utility tariff costs and financing costs and the period for recovery of such costs;
130 (f) A comparison between the net present value of the costs to customers that are
131 estimatedtoresultfromtheissuanceofsecuritizedutilitytariffbondsandthecoststhatwould
132 result from the application of the traditional method of financing and recovering the
133 undepreciated investment of facilities that may become securitized utility tariff costs from
134 customers. The comparison should demonstrate that the issuance of securitized utility tariff
135 bonds and the imposition of securitized utility tariff charges are expected to provide
136 quantifiable net present value benefits to customers;
137 (g) A proposed future ratemaking process to reconcile any differences between
138 securitized utility tariff costs financed by securitized utility tariff bonds and the final
139 securitized costs incurred by the electrical corporation or assignee provided that any such
140 reconciliation shall not affect the amount of securitized utility tariff bonds or the associated
141 securitized utility tariff charges paid by customers; and
142 (h) Direct testimony supporting the petition.
143 (2) An electrical corporation may petition the commission for a financing order to
144 finance qualified extraordinary costs. The petition shall include all of the following:
145 (a) A description of the qualified extraordinary costs, including their magnitude, the
146 reasons those costs were incurred by the electrical corporation and the retail customer rate
147 impact that would result from customary ratemaking treatment of such costs;
148 (b) An indicator of whether the electrical corporation proposes to finance all or a
149 portion of the qualified extraordinary costs using securitized utility tariff bonds. If the
150 electrical corporation proposes to finance a portion of the costs, the electrical corporation
151 shall identify the specific portion in the petition. By electing not to finance all or any portion
152 of such qualified extraordinary costs using securitized utility tariff bonds, an electrical
153 corporation shall not be deemed to waive its right to reflect such costs in its retail rates
154 pursuant to a separate proceeding with the commission;
155 (c) An estimate of the financing costs related to the securitized utility tariff bonds;
HB 1746 23
156 (d) An estimate of the securitized utility tariff charges necessary to recover the
157 qualified extraordinary costs and financing costs and the period for recovery of such costs;
158 (e) A comparison between the net present value of the costs to customers that are
159 estimatedtoresultfromtheissuanceofsecuritizedutilitytariffbondsandthecoststhatwould
160 result from the application of the customary method of financing and reflecting the qualified
161 extraordinary costs in retail customer rates. The comparison should demonstrate that the
162 issuance of securitized utility tariff bonds and the imposition of securitized utility tariff
163 charges are expected to provide quantifiable net present value benefits to retail customers;
164 (f) A proposed future ratemaking process to reconcile any differences between
165 securitized utility tariff costs financed by securitized utility tariff bonds and the final
166 securitized costs incurred by the electrical corporation or assignee provided that any such
167 reconciliation shall not affect the amount of securitized utility tariff bonds or the associated
168 securitized utility tariff charges paid by customers; and
169 (g) Direct testimony supporting the petition.
170 (3) (a) Proceedings on a petition submitted pursuant to this subsection begin withthe
171 petition by an electrical corporation and shall be disposed of in accordance with the
172 requirements of this section and the rules of the commission, except as follows:
173 a. The commission shall establish a procedural schedule that permits a commission
174 decision no later than two hundred fifteen days after the date the petition is filed;
175 b. No later than two hundred fifteen days after the date the petition is filed, the
176 commission shall issue a financing order approving the petition, an order approving the
177 petition subject to conditions, or an order rejecting the petition; provided, however, that the
178 electrical corporation shall provide notice of intent to file a petition for a financing order to
179 the commission no less than sixty days in advance of such filing;
180 c. Judicial review of a financing order may be had only in accordance with sections
181 386.500 and 386.510.
182 (b) In performing its responsibilities under this section in approving, approving
183 subject to conditions, or rejecting a petition for a financing order, the commission may retain
184 counsel, one or more financial advisors, or other consultants as it deems appropriate. Such
185 outside counsel, advisor or advisors, or consultants shall owe a duty of loyalty solely to the
186 commission and shall have no interest in the proposed securitized utility tariff bonds. The
187 costs associated with any such engagements shall be paid by the petitioning corporation and
188 shall be included as financed costs in the securitized utility tariff charge and shall not be an
189 obligation of the state and shall be assigned solely to the subject transaction. The
190 commission may directly contract counsel, financial advisors, or other consultants as
191 necessary for effectuating the purposes of this section. Such contracting procedures
192 shall not be subject to the provisions of chapter 34; however the commission shall
HB 1746 24
193 establish a policy for the bid process. Such policy shall be publicly available and any
194 information related to contracts under the established policy shall be included in
195 publicly available rate case documentation.
196 (c) A financing order issued by the commission, after a hearing, to an electrical
197 corporation shall include all of the following elements:
198 a. The amount of securitized utility tariff costs to be financed using securitized utility
199 tariff bonds and a finding that recovery of such costs is just and reasonable and in the public
200 interest. The commission shall describe and estimate the amount of financing costs that may
201 be recovered through securitized utility tariff charges and specify the period over which
202 securitized utility tariff costs and financing costs may be recovered;
203 b. A finding that the proposed issuance of securitized utility tariff bonds and the
204 imposition and collection of a securitized utility tariff charge are just and reasonable and in
205 the public interest and are expected to provide quantifiable net present value benefits to
206 customers as compared to recovery of the components of securitized utility tariff costs that
207 would have been incurred absent the issuance of securitized utility tariff bonds.
208 Notwithstanding any provisions of this section to the contrary, in considering whether to
209 find the proposed issuance of securitized utility tariff bonds and the imposition and collection
210 of a securitized utility tariff charge are just and reasonable and in the public interest, the
211 commission may consider previous instances where it has issued financing orders to the
212 petitioning electrical corporation and such electrical corporation has previously issued
213 securitized utility tariff bonds;
214 c. A finding that the proposed structuring and pricing of the securitized utility tariff
215 bonds are reasonably expected to result in the lowest securitized utility tariff charges
216 consistent with market conditions at the time the securitized utility tariffbonds are priced and
217 the terms of the financing order;
218 d. Arequirementthat,forsolongasthesecuritizedutilitytariffbondsareoutstanding
219 and until all financing costs have been paid in full, the imposition and collection of
220 securitized utility tariff charges authorized under a financing order shall be nonbypassable
221 and paid by all existing and future retail customers receiving electrical service from the
222 electrical corporation or its successors or assignees under commission-approved rate
223 schedules except for customers receiving electrical service under special contracts on August
224 28, 2021, even if a retail customer elects to purchase electricity from an alternative electric
225 supplier following a fundamental change in regulation of public utilities in this state;
226 e. A formula-based true-up mechanism for making, at least annually, expeditious
227 periodic adjustments in the securitized utility tariff charges that customers are required to pay
228 pursuant to the financing order and for making any adjustments that are necessary to correct
229 for any overcollection or undercollection of the charges or to otherwise ensure the timely
HB 1746 25
230 paymentofsecuritized utilitytariffbondsand financingcostsand otherrequiredamountsand
231 charges payable under the securitized utility tariff bonds;
232 f. The securitized utility tariff property that is, or shall be, created in favor of an
233 electrical corporation or its successors or assignees and that shall be used to pay or secure
234 securitized utility tariff bonds and approved financing costs;
235 g. The degree of flexibility to be afforded to the electrical corporation in establishing
236 the terms and conditions of the securitized utility tariff bonds, including, but not limited to,
237 repayment schedules, expected interest rates, and other financing costs;
238 h. How securitized utility tariff charges will be allocated among retail customer
239 classes. The initial allocation shall remain in effect until the electrical corporation completes
240 a general rate proceeding, and once the commission's order from that general rate proceeding
241 becomes final, all subsequent applications of an adjustment mechanism regarding securitized
242 utility tariff charges shall incorporate changes in the allocation of costs to customers as
243 detailed in the commission's order from the electrical corporation's most recent general rate
244 proceeding;
245 i. A requirement that, after the final terms of an issuance of securitized utility tariff
246 bonds have been established and before the issuance of securitized utility tariff bonds, the
247 electrical corporation determines the resulting initial securitized utility tariff charge in
248 accordance with the financing order, and that such initial securitized utility tariff charge be
249 final and effective upon the issuance of such securitized utility tariff bonds with such charge
250 to be reflected on a compliance tariff sheet bearing such charge;
251 j. A method of tracing funds collected as securitized utility tariff charges, or other
252 proceeds of securitized utility tariff property, determining that such method shall be deemed
253 the method of tracing such funds and determining the identifiable cash proceeds of any
254 securitized utility tariff property subject to a financing order under applicable law;
255 k. A statement specifying a future ratemaking process to reconcile any differences
256 between the actual securitized utility tariff costs financed by securitized utility tariff bonds
257 and the final securitized utility tariff costs incurred by the electrical corporation or assignee
258 provided that any such reconciliation shall not affect the amount of securitized utility tariff
259 bonds or the associated securitized utility tariff charges paid by customers;
260 l. Aprocedurethatshallallowtheelectricalcorporationtoearnareturn,atthecostof
261 capital authorized from time to time by the commission in the electrical corporation's rate

263 capital accounts established under the terms of any indenture, ancillary agreement, or other
264 financing documents pertaining to the securitized utility tariff bonds;
265 m. In a financing order granting authorization to securitize energy transition costs or
266 in a financing order granting authorization to securitize qualified extraordinary costs that
HB 1746 26
267 include retired or abandoned facility costs, a procedure for the treatment of accumulated
268 deferred income taxes and excess deferred income taxes in connection with the retired or
269 abandoned or to be retired or abandoned electric generating facility, or in connection with
270 retired or abandoned facilities included in qualified extraordinary costs. The accumulated
271 deferred income taxes, including excess deferred income taxes, shall be excluded from rate
272 base in future general rate cases and the net tax benefits relating to amounts that will be
273 recovered through the issuance of securitized utility tariff bonds shall be credited to retail
274 customersbyreducingtheamountofsuchsecuritizedutilitytariffbondsthatwouldotherwise
275 be issued. The customer credit shall include the net present value of the tax benefits,
276 calculated using a discount rate equal to the expected interest rate of the securitized utility
277 tariff bonds, for the estimated accumulated and excess deferred income taxes at the time of
278 securitization including timing differences created by the issuance of securitized utility tariff
279 bonds amortized over the period of the bonds multiplied by the expected interest rate on such
280 securitized utility tariff bonds;
281 n. Anoutsidedate,whichshallnotbeearlierthanoneyearafterthedatethefinancing
282 order is no longer subject to appeal, when the authority to issue securitized utility tariff bonds
283 granted in such financing order shall expire; and
284 o. Includeanyotherconditionsthatthecommissionconsidersappropriateandthatare
285 not inconsistent with this section.
286 (d) A financing order issued to an electrical corporation may provide that creation of
287 the electrical corporation's securitized utility tariff property is conditioned upon, and
288 simultaneous with, the sale or other transfer of the securitized utility tariff property to an
289 assignee and the pledge of the securitized utility tariff property to secure securitized utility
290 tariff bonds.
291 (e) If the commission issues a financing order, the electrical corporation shall file
292 withthecommissionatleastannuallya petitionoraletterapplyingtheformula-basedtrue-up
293 mechanism and, based on estimates of consumption for each rate class and other
294 mathematical factors, requesting administrative approval to make the applicable
295 adjustments. The review of the filing shall be limited to determining whether there are
296 anymathematicalorclericalerrorsintheapplicationoftheformula-basedtrue-upmechanism
297 relating to the appropriate amount of any overcollection or undercollection of securitized
298 utility tariff charges and the amount of an adjustment. The adjustments shall ensure the
299 recovery of revenues sufficient to provide for the payment of principal, interest, acquisition,
300 defeasance, financing costs, or redemption premium and other fees, costs, and charges in
301 respect of securitized utility tariff bonds approved under the financing order. Within thirty
302 days after receiving an electrical corporation's request pursuant to this paragraph, the
303 commission shall either approve the request or inform the electrical corporation of any
HB 1746 27
304 mathematical or clerical errors in its calculation. If the commission informs the electrical
305 corporationofmathematicalorclericalerrorsinitscalculation,theelectricalcorporationshall
306 correct its error and refile its request. The time frames previously described in this paragraph
307 shall apply to a refiled request.

310 order is irrevocable and, except for changes made pursuant to the formula-based true-up
311 mechanism authorized in this section, the commission may not amend, modify, or terminate
312 the financing order by any subsequent action or reduce, impair, postpone, terminate, or
313 otherwise adjust securitized utility tariff charges approved in the financing order. After the
314 issuance of a financing order, the electrical corporation retains sole discretion regarding
315 whether to assign, sell, or otherwise transfer securitized utility tariff property or to cause
316 securitized utility tariff bonds to be issued, including the right to defer or postpone such
317 assignment, sale, transfer, or issuance.
318 (g) The commission, in a financing order and subject to the issuance advice letter
319 process under paragraph (h) of this subdivision, shall specify the degree of flexibility to be
320 afforded the electrical corporation in establishing the terms and conditions for the securitized
321 utility tariff bonds to accommodate changes in market conditions, including repayment
322 schedules, interest rates, financing costs, collateral requirements, required debt service and
323 other reserves and the ability of the electrical corporation, at its option, to effect a series of
324 issuancesofsecuritizedutilitytariffbondsandcorrelatedassignments,sales,pledges,orother
325 transfers of securitized utility tariff property. Any changes made under this paragraph to
326 terms and conditions for the securitized utility tariff bonds shall be in conformance with the
327 financing order.
328 (h) As the actual structure and pricing of the securitized utility tariff bonds will be
329 unknown at the time the financing order is issued, prior to the issuance of each series of
330 bonds, an issuance advice letter shall be provided to the commission by the electrical
331 corporation following the determination of the final terms of such series of bonds no later
332 than one day after the pricing of the securitized utility tariff bonds. The commission shall
333 havetheauthoritytodesignatearepresentativeorrepresentativesfromcommissionstaff,who
334 may be advised by a financial advisor or advisors contracted with the commission, to provide
335 input to the electrical corporation and collaborate with the electrical corporation in all facets
336 of the process undertaken by the electrical corporation to place the securitized utility tariff
337 bonds to market so the commission's representative or representatives can provide the
338 commissionwithanopiniononthereasonablenessofthepricing,terms,andconditionsofthe
339 securitized utility tariff bonds on an expedited basis. Neither the designated representative or

342 to market although they shall be permitted to attend all meetings convened by the electrical
343 corporation to address placement of the bonds to market. The form of such issuance advice
344 letter shall be included in the financing order and shall indicate the final structure of the
345 securitized utility tariff bonds and provide the best available estimate of total ongoing
346 financing costs. The issuance advice letter shall report the initial securitized utility tariff
347 chargesandotherinformationspecifictothesecuritizedutilitytariffbondstobeissued,asthe
348 commission may require. Unless an earlier date is specified in the financing order, the
349 electrical corporation may proceed with the issuance of the securitized utility tariff bonds
350 unless, prior to noon on the fourth business day after the commission receives the issuance
351 advice letter, the commission issues a disapproval letter directing that the bonds as proposed
352 shall not be issued and the basis for that disapproval. The financing order may provide such
353 additional provisions relating to the issuance advice letter process as the commission
354 considers appropriate and as are not inconsistent with this section.
355 (4) (a) In performing the responsibilities of this section in connection with the
356 issuance of a financing order, approving the petition, an order approving the petition subject
357 to conditions, or an order rejecting the petition, the commission shall undertake due diligence
358 as it deems appropriate prior to the issuance of the order regarding the petition pursuant to
359 whichthe commissionmay requestadditional information from the electrical corporation and
360 may engage one or more financial advisors, one or more consultants, and counsel as the
361 commission deems necessary. Any financial advisor or advisors, counsel, and consultants
362 engaged by the commission shall have a fiduciary duty with respect to the proposed issuance
363 of securitized utility bonds solely to the commission. All expenses associated with such
364 services shall be included as part of the financing costs of the securitized utility tariff bonds
365 and shall be included in the securitized utility tariff charge.
366 (b) If an electrical corporation's petition for a financing order is denied or withdrawn,
367 or for any reason securitized utility tariff bonds are not issued, any costs of retaining one or
368 more financial advisors, one or more consultants, and counsel on behalf of the commission
369 shall be paid by the petitioning electrical corporation and shall be eligible for full recovery,
370 including carrying costs, if approved by the commission in the electrical corporation's future
371 rates.
372 (5) At the request of an electrical corporation, the commission may commence a
373 proceeding and issue a subsequent financing order that provides for refinancing, retiring, or
374 refunding securitized utility tariff bonds issued pursuant to the original financing order if the
375 commission finds that the subsequent financing order satisfies all of the criteria specified in
376 thissectionforafinancingorder. Effectiveuponretirementoftherefundedsecuritizedutility

378 adjust the related securitized utility tariff charges accordingly.
379 (6) (a) Afinancingorderremainsineffectandsecuritizedutilitytariffpropertyunder
380 the financing order continues to exist until securitized utility tariff bonds issued pursuant to
381 the financing order have been paid in full or defeased and, in each case, all commission-
382 approved financing costs of such securitized utility tariff bonds have been recovered in full.
383 (b) A financing order issued to an electrical corporation remains in effect and
384 unabated notwithstanding the reorganization, bankruptcy, or other insolvency proceedings,
385 merger, or sale of the electrical corporation or its successors or assignees.
386 3. (1) The commission may not, in exercising its powers and carrying out its duties
387 regarding any matter within its authority, consider the securitized utility tariff bonds issued
388 pursuant to a financing order to be the debt of the electrical corporation other than for federal
389 and state income tax purposes, consider the securitized utility tariff charges paid under the
390 financing order to be the revenue of the electrical corporation for any purpose, consider the
391 securitizedutility tariffcostsor financingcostsspecifiedinthe financingorderto bethe costs
392 of the electrical corporation, nor may the commission determine any action taken by an
393 electrical corporation which is consistent with the financing order to be unjust or
394 unreasonable, and section 386.300 shall not apply to the issuance of securitized utility
395 tariff bonds.
396 (2) Securitized utility tariff charges shall not be utilized or accounted for in
397 determining the electrical corporation's average overall rate, as defined in section 393.1655
398 and as used to determine the maximum retail rate impact limitations provided for by
399 subsections 3 and 4 of section 393.1655.
400 (3) No electrical corporation is required to file a petition for a financing order under
401 this section or otherwise utilize this section. An electrical corporation's decision not to file a
402 petition for a financing order under this section shall not be admissible in any commission
403 proceedingnorshallitbeotherwiseutilizedorreliedonbythecommissioninanyproceeding
404 respecting the electrical corporation's rates or its accounting, including, without limitation,
405 any general rate proceeding, fuel adjustment clause docket, or proceedings relating to
406 accounting authority, whether initiated by the electrical corporation or otherwise. The
407 commission may not order or otherwise directly or indirectly require an electrical corporation
408 to use securitized utility tariff bonds to recover securitized utility tariff costs or to finance any
409 project, addition, plant, facility, extension, capital improvement, equipment, or any other
410 expenditure.
411 (4) The commission may not refuse to allow an electrical corporation to recover
412 securitized utility tariff costs in an otherwise permissible fashion, or refuse or condition
413 authorization or approval of the issuance and sale by an electrical corporation of securities or
HB 1746 30
414 the assumption by the electrical corporation of liabilities or obligations, because of the
415 potential availability of securitized utility tariff bond financing.
416 (5) After the issuance of a financing order with or without conditions, the electrical
417 corporation retains sole discretion regarding whether to cause the securitized utility tariff
418 bonds to be issued, including the right to defer or postpone such sale, assignment, transfer, or
419 issuance. Nothing shall prevent the electrical corporation from abandoning the issuance of
420 securitized utility tariff bonds under the financing order by filing with the commission a
421 statement of abandonment and the reasons therefor; provided, that the electrical corporation's
422 abandonment decision shall not be deemed imprudent because of the potential availability of
423 securitized utility tariff bond financing; and provided further, that an electrical corporation's
424 decision to abandon issuance of such bonds may be raised by any party, including the
425 commission, as a reason the commission should not authorize, or should modify, the rate-
426 making treatment proposed by the electrical corporation of the costs associated with the

431 (6) The commission may not, directly or indirectly, utilize or consider the debt
432 reflected by the securitized utility tariff bonds in establishing the electrical corporation's
433 capital structure used to determine any regulatory matter, including but not limited to the
434 electrical corporation's revenue requirement used to set its rates.
435 (7) The commission may not, directly or indirectly, consider the existence of
436 securitized utility tariff bonds or the potential use of securitized utility tariff bond financing
437 proceeds in determining the electrical corporation's authorized rate of return used to
438 determine the electrical corporation's revenue requirement used to set its rates.
439 4. The electric bills of an electrical corporation that has obtained a financing order
440 andcausedsecuritizedutilitytariffbondstobeissuedshallcomplywiththeprovisionsofthis
441 subsection; however, the failure of an electrical corporation to comply with this subsection
442 does not invalidate, impair, or affect any financing order, securitized utility tariff property,
443 securitized utility tariff charge, or securitized utility tariff bonds. The electrical corporation
444 shall do the following:
445 (1) Explicitly reflect that a portion of the charges on such bill represents securitized
446 utility tariff charges approved in a financing order issued to the electrical corporation and, if
447 the securitized utility tariff property has been transferred to an assignee, shall include a
448 statement to the effect that the assignee is the owner of the rights to securitized utility tariff
449 charges and that the electrical corporation or other entity, if applicable, is acting as a
HB 1746 31
450 collection agent or servicer for the assignee. The tariff applicable to customers shall indicate
451 the securitized utility tariff charge and the ownership of the charge;
452 (2) Include the securitized utility tariff charge on each customer's bill as a separate
453 line item and include both the rate and the amount of the charge on each bill.
454 5. (1) (a) All securitized utility tariff property that is specified in a financing order
455 constitutes an existing, present intangible property right or interest therein, notwithstanding
456 that the imposition and collection of securitized utility tariff charges depends on the electrical
457 corporation,to whichthe financingorder isissued,performing its servicing functions relating
458 to the collection of securitized utility tariff charges and on future electricity consumption.
459 The property exists:
460 a. Regardless of whether or not the revenues or proceeds arising from the property
461 have been billed, have accrued, or have been collected; and
462 b. Notwithstanding the fact that the value or amount of the property is dependent on
463 the future provision of service to customers by the electrical corporation or its successors or
464 assignees and the future consumption of electricity by customers.
465 (b) Securitized utility tariff property specified in a financing order exists until
466 securitized utility tariff bonds issued pursuant to the financing order are paid in full and all
467 financing costs and other costs of such securitized utility tariff bonds have been recovered in
468 full.
469 (c) All or any portion of securitized utility tariff property specified in a financing
470 order issued to an electrical corporation may be transferred, sold, conveyed, or assigned to a
471 successororassigneethatiswhollyowned,directlyorindirectly,bytheelectricalcorporation
472 and created for the limited purpose of acquiring, owning, or administering securitized utility
473 tariff property or issuing securitized utility tariff bonds under the financing order. All or any
474 portion of securitized utility tariff property may be pledged to secure securitized utility tariff
475 bonds issued pursuant to the financing order, amounts payable to financing parties and to
476 counterparties under any ancillary agreements, and other financing costs. Any transfer, sale,
477 conveyance, assignment, grant of a security interest in or pledge of securitized utility tariff
478 property by an electrical corporation, or an affiliate of the electrical corporation, to an
479 assignee, to the extent previously authorized in a financing order, does not require the prior
480 consent and approval of the commission.
481 (d) If an electrical corporation defaults on any required remittance of securitized
482 utility tariff charges arising from securitized utility tariff property specified in a financing
483 order, a court, upon application by an interested party, and without limiting any other
484 remedies available to the applying party, shall order the sequestration and payment of the
485 revenues arising from the securitized utility tariff property to the financing parties or their
486 assignees. Any such financing order remains in full force and effect notwithstanding any
HB 1746 32
487 reorganization, bankruptcy, or other insolvency proceedings with respect to the electrical
488 corporation or its successors or assignees.
489 (e) Theinterestofatransferee,purchaser,acquirer,assignee,orpledgeeinsecuritized
490 utility tariff property specified in a financing order issued to an electrical corporation, and in
491 the revenue and collections arising from that property, is not subject to setoff, counterclaim,
492 surcharge, or defense by the electrical corporation or any other person or in connection with
493 the reorganization, bankruptcy, or other insolvency of the electrical corporation or any other
494 entity.
495 (f) Anysuccessortoanelectricalcorporation,whetherpursuanttoanyreorganization,
496 bankruptcy, or other insolvency proceeding or whether pursuant to any merger or acquisition,
497 sale, or other business combination, or transfer by operation of law, as a result of electrical
498 corporation restructuring or otherwise, shall perform and satisfy all obligations of, and have
499 thesamerightsunderafinancingorderas,theelectricalcorporationunderthefinancingorder
500 in the same manner and to the same extent as the electrical corporation, including collecting
501 and paying to the person entitled to receive the revenues, collections, payments, or proceeds
502 of the securitized utility tariff property. Nothing in this section is intended to limit or impair
503 any authority of the commission concerning the transfer or succession of interests of public
504 utilities.
505 (g) Securitized utility tariff bonds shall be nonrecourse to the credit or any assets of
506 the electrical corporation other than the securitized utility tariff property as specified in the
507 financing order and any rights under any ancillary agreement.
508 (2) (a) The creation, perfection, priority, and enforcement of any security interest in
509 securitized utility tariff property to secure the repayment of the principal and interest and
510 other amounts payable in respect of securitized utility tariff bonds, amounts payable under
511 any ancillary agreement and other financing costs are governed by this section and not by the
512 provisions of the code, except as otherwise provided in this section.
513 (b) A security interest in securitized utility tariff property is created, valid, and
514 binding at the later of the time:
515 a. The financing order is issued;
516 b. A security agreement is executed and delivered by the debtor granting such
517 security interest;
518 c. The debtor has rights in such securitized utility tariff property or the power to
519 transfer rights in such securitized utility tariff property; or
520 d. Value is received for the securitized utility tariff property.
521
522 The description of securitized utility tariff property in a security agreement is sufficient if the
523 description refers to this section and the financing order creating the securitized utility tariff
HB 1746 33
524 property. A security interest shall attach as provided in this paragraph without any physical
525 delivery of collateral or other act.
526 (c) Upon the filing of a financing statement with the office of the secretary of state as
527 provided in this section, a security interest in securitized utility tariff property shall be
528 perfected against all parties having claims of any kind in tort, contract, or otherwise against
529 the person granting the security interest, and regardless of whether the parties have notice of
530 the security interest. Without limiting the foregoing, upon such filing a security interest in
531 securitized utility tariff property shall be perfected against all claims of lien creditors, and
532 shall have priority over all competing security interests and other claims other than any
533 security interest previously perfected in accordance with this section.
534 (d) The priority of a security interest in securitized utility tariff property is not
535 affected by the commingling of securitized utility tariff charges with other amounts. Any
536 pledgee or secured party shall have a perfected security interest in the amount of all
537 securitized utility tariff charges that are deposited in any cash or deposit account of the
538 qualifying electrical corporation in which securitized utility tariff charges have been
539 commingled with other funds and any other security interest that may apply to those funds
540 shall be terminated when they are transferred to a segregated account for the assignee or a
541 financing party.
542 (e) No application of the formula-based true-up mechanism as provided in this
543 section will affect the validity, perfection, or priority of a security interest in or transfer of
544 securitized utility tariff property.
545 (f) If a default occurs under the securitized utility tariff bonds that are secured by a
546 security interest in securitized utility tariff property, the financing parties or their
547 representatives may exercise the rights and remedies available to a secured party under the
548 code, including the rights and remedies available under part 6 of article 9 of the code. The
549 commission may also order amounts arising from securitized utility tariff charges be
550 transferred to a separate account for the financing parties' benefit, to which their lien and
551 security interest shall apply. On application by or on behalf of the financing parties, the
552 circuitcourt for thecountyorcity inwhich theelectricalcorporation's headquartersislocated
553 shall order the sequestration and payment to them of revenues arising from the securitized
554 utility tariff charges.
555 (3) (a) Any sale, assignment, or other transfer of securitized utility tariff property
556 shall be an absolute transfer and true sale of, and not a pledge of or secured transaction
557 relating to, the seller's right, title, and interest in, to, and under the securitized utility tariff
558 property if the documents governing the transaction expressly state that the transaction is a
559 sale or other absolute transfer other than for federal and state income tax purposes. For all
560 purposes other than federal and state income tax purposes, the parties' characterization of a
HB 1746 34
561 transaction as a sale of an interest in securitized utility tariff property shall be conclusive that
562 the transaction is a true sale and that ownership has passed to the party characterized as the
563 purchaser, regardless of whether the purchaser has possession of any documents evidencing
564 or pertaining to the interest. A sale or similar outright transfer of an interest in securitized
565 utility tariff property may occur only when all of the following have occurred:
566 a. The financing order creating the securitized utility tariff property has become
567 effective;
568 b. The documents evidencing the transfer of securitized utility tariff property have
569 been executed by the assignor and delivered to the assignee; and
570 c. Value is received for the securitized utility tariff property.
571
572 After such a transaction, the securitized utility tariff property is not subject to any claims of
573 the transferor or the transferor's creditors, other than creditors holding a prior security interest
574 in the securitized utility tariff property perfected in accordance with this section.
575 (b) The characterization of the sale, assignment, or other transfer as an absolute
576 transfer and true sale and the corresponding characterization of the property interest of the
577 purchaser shall not be affected or impaired by the occurrence of any of the following factors:
578 a. Commingling of securitized utility tariff charges with other amounts;
579 b. The retention by the seller of (i) a partial or residual interest, including an equity
580 interest, in the securitized utility tariff property, whether direct or indirect, or whether
581 subordinate or otherwise, or (ii) the right to recover costs associated with taxes, franchise
582 fees, or license fees imposed on the collection of securitized utility tariff charges;
583 c. Any recourse that the purchaser may have against the seller;
584 d. Any indemnification rights, obligations, or repurchase rights made or provided by
585 the seller;
586 e. The obligation of the seller to collect securitized utility tariff charges on behalf of
587 an assignee;
588 f. The transferor acting as the servicer of the securitized utility tariff charges or the
589 existence of any contract that authorizes or requires the electrical corporation, to the extent
590 that any interest in securitized utility tariff property is sold or assigned, to contract with the
591 assigneeor any financing party that it will continue to operate its system to provide service to
592 its customers, will collect amounts in respect of the securitized utility tariff charges for the
593 benefit and account of such assignee or financing party, and will account for and remit such
594 amounts to or for the account of such assignee or financing party;
595 g. The treatment of the sale, conveyance, assignment, or other transfer for tax,
596 financial reporting, or other purposes;

597 h. The granting or providing to bondholders a preferred right to the securitized utility
598 tariff property or credit enhancement by the electrical corporation or its affiliates with respect
599 to such securitized utility tariff bonds;
600 i. Any application of the formula-based true-up mechanism as provided in this
601 section.
602 (c) Any right that an electrical corporation has in the securitized utility tariffproperty
603 beforeitspledge,sale,ortransferoranyotherrightcreatedunderthissectionorcreatedinthe
604 financing order and assignable under this section or assignable pursuant to a financing order
605 is property in the form of a contract right or a chose in action. Transfer of an interest in
606 securitized utility tariff property to an assignee is enforceable only upon the later of:
607 a. The issuance of a financing order;
608 b. The assignor having rights in such securitized utility tariff property or the power to
609 transfer rights in such securitized utility tariff property to an assignee;
610 c. The execution and delivery by the assignor of transfer documents in connection
611 with the issuance of securitized utility tariff bonds; and
612 d. The receipt of value for the securitized utility tariff property.
613
614 An enforceable transfer of an interest in securitized utility tariff property to an assignee is

617 subsection 7 of this section. The transfer is perfected against third parties as of the date of
618 filing.
619 (d) The priority of a transfer perfected under this section is not impaired by any later
620 modificationofthefinancingorderorsecuritizedutilitytariffpropertyorbythecommingling
621 of funds arising from securitized utility tariff property with other funds. Any other security
622 interest that may apply to those funds, other than a security interest perfected under this
623 section, is terminated when they are transferred to a segregated account for the assignee or a
624 financing party. If securitized utility tariff property has been transferred to an assignee or
625 financing party, any proceeds of that property shall be held in trust for the assignee or
626 financing party.
627 (e) The priority of the conflicting interests of assignees in the same interest or rights
628 in any securitized utility tariff property is determined as follows:
629 a. Conflicting perfected interests or rights of assignees rank according to priority in
630 time of perfection. Priority dates from the time a filing covering the transfer is made in
631 accordance with subsection 7 of this section;
632 b. A perfected interest or right of an assignee has priority over a conflicting
633 unperfected interest or right of an assignee;
HB 1746 36
634 c. A perfected interest or right of an assignee has priority over a person who becomes
635 a lien creditor after the perfection of such assignee's interest or right.

637 inanysaleagreement,purchaseagreement,orothertransferagreement,grantedorpledgedto
638 a pledgee in any security agreement, pledge agreement, or other security document, or
639 indicated in any financing statement is only sufficient if such description or indication refers
640 to the financing order that created the securitized utility tariff property and states that the
641 agreement or financing statement covers all or part of the property described in the financing
642 order. This section applies to all purported transfers of, and all purported grants or liens or
643 security interests in, securitized utility tariff property, regardless of whether the related sale
644 agreement, purchase agreement, other transfer agreement, security agreement, pledge
645 agreement,orother security documentwas entered into,orany financing statementwasfiled.
646 7. The secretary of state shall maintain any financing statement filed to perfect a sale
647 or other transfer of securitized utility tariff property and any security interest in securitized
648 utility tariff property under this section in the same manner that the secretary of state
649 maintains financing statements filed under the code to perfect a security interest in collateral
650 owned by a transmitting utility. Except as otherwise provided in this section, all financing
651 statements filed pursuant to this section shall be governed by the provisions regarding
652 financing statements and the filing thereof under the code, including part 5 of article 9 of the
653 code. A security interest in securitized utility tariff property may be perfected only by the
654 filing of a financing statement in accordance with this section, and no other method of
655 perfection shall be effective. Notwithstanding any provision of the code to the contrary, a
656 financing statement filed pursuant to this section is effective until a termination statement is
657 filedunderthecode,andnocontinuationstatementneedbefiledtomaintainitseffectiveness.
658 A financing statement filed pursuant to this section may indicate that the debtor is a
659 transmitting utility, and without regard to whether the debtor is an electrical corporation, an
660 assigneeorotherwise qualifies asa transmittingutility under the code,but the failureto make
661 such indication shall not impair the duration and effectiveness of the financing statement.
662 8. The law governing the validity, enforceability, attachment, perfection, priority, and
663 exercise of remedies with respect to the transfer of an interest or right or the pledge or
664 creation of a security interest in any securitized utility tariff property shall be the laws of this
665 state.
666 9. Neither the state nor its political subdivisions are liable on any securitized utility
667 tariff bonds, and the bonds are not a debt or a general obligation of the state or any of its
668 political subdivisions, agencies, or instrumentalities, nor are they special obligations or
669 indebtednessofthestateoranyagencyorpoliticalsubdivision. Anissueofsecuritizedutility
670 tariff bonds does not, directly, indirectly, or contingently, obligate the state or any agency,
HB 1746 37
671 political subdivision, or instrumentality of the state to levy any tax or make any appropriation
672 for payment of the securitized utility tariff bonds, other than in their capacity as consumers of
673 electricity. All securitized utility tariff bonds shall contain on the face thereof a statement to
674 the following effect: "Neither the full faith and credit nor the taxing power of the state of
675 Missouri is pledged to the payment of the principal of, or interest on, this bond.".
676 10. All of the following entities may legally invest any sinking funds, moneys, or
677 other funds in securitized utility tariff bonds:
678 (1) Subject to applicable statutory restrictions on state or local investment authority,
679 the state, units of local government, political subdivisions, public bodies, and public officers,
680 except for members of the commission, the commission's technical advisory and other staff,

687 nature.
688 11. (1) The state and its agencies, including the commission, pledge and agree with
689 bondholders, the owners of the securitized utility tariff property, and other financing parties
690 that the state and its agencies will not take any action listed in this subdivision. This
691 subdivision does not preclude limitation or alteration if full compensation is made by law for
692 the full protection of the securitized utility tariff charges collected pursuant to a financing
693 orderandofthebondholders andanyassigneeorfinancingparty enteringintoacontract with
694 the electrical corporation. The prohibited actions are as follows:
695 (a) Alter the provisions of this section, which authorize the commission to create an
696 irrevocable contract right or chose in action by the issuance of a financing order, to create
697 securitized utility tariff property, and make the securitized utility tariff charges imposed by a
698 financing order irrevocable, binding, or nonbypassable charges for all existing and future
699 retail customers of the electrical corporation except its existing special contract customers;
700 (b) Take or permit any action that impairs or would impair the value of securitized

709 financing costs and other fees, expenses, or charges incurred, and any contracts to be
710 performed, in connection with the related securitized utility tariff bonds have been paid and
711 performed in full.
