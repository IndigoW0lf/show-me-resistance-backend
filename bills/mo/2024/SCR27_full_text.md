SENATE CONCURRENT RESOLUTION NO. 27
Relating to SCN2A awareness day.
Whereas, mutations of the SCN2A gene are the leading
single cause of neurodevelopmental disorders such as autism,
childhood seizures, and intellectual disabilities; and
Whereas, SCN2A disorders are also associated with a
spectrum of syndromes ranging from severe, life-threatening
conditions to developmental delays, including sleep
disturbances, gastrointestinal dysfunction, movement
disorders, pain, and dysautonomia; and
Whereas, research predicts that approximately one in
nine thousand people will be diagnosed with SCN2A-related
disorders; and
Whereas, while SCN2A-related disorders can be easily
identified by DNA testing, SCN2A-related disorders
frequently go undetected due to a lack of awareness, even
within the medical community; and
Whereas, the field of study of SCN2A-related disorders
is growing, but additional studies are needed to develop
therapies and treatments:
Now, Therefore, Be It Resolved by the members of the
Missouri Senate, One Hundred Second General Assembly, Second
Regular Session, the House of Representatives concurring
therein, hereby designate February 24 of each year as "SCN2A
Awareness Day" in Missouri; and
Be It Further Resolved that the General Assembly
encourages all residents of this state to participate in
activities and wear purple, blue, or green on this day to
bring awareness of these conditions and the need for
treatment; and
1
Be It Further Resolved that this resolution be sent to
the Governor for his approval or rejection pursuant to the
Missouri Constitution.
