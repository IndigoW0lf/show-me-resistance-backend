124 proceeding arising from the construction contract to be
125 conducted in another state; and
126 (8) An agreement, provision, covenant, clause, or
127 understanding in, collateral to, implied in, or affecting a
128 construction contract stating the payment by the owner to
129 the contractor, or the payment by the contractor to a
130 subcontractor or supplier, or the payment by a subcontractor
131 to a sub-subcontractor or supplier at any tier, is a
132 condition precedent for payment to either the subcontractor,
133 sub-subcontractor, or supplier at whatever tier who has
134 performed in accordance with the terms of its construction
135 contract.
136 4. (1) In any construction contract between an owner
137 and a contractor, the parties shall include a provision that
138 requires the owner to pay the contractor within forty days
139 after receipt of an invoice or pay application following
140 satisfactory completion of the portion of the work for which
141 the contractor has sought payment. Any construction
142 contract that does not contain such a provision shall be
143 deemed to include such provision notwithstanding any
144 language to the contrary contained in the construction
145 contract or other contract documents incorporated therein or
SB 1257 6
146 otherwise governing the construction contract. An owner
147 shall not be required to pay amounts invoiced or subject to
148 a contractor's pay application to the extent they are
149 subject to withholding under the contractor's construction
150 contract with the owner due to the contractor's material
151 noncompliance with the terms of the construction contract.
152 The amount withheld shall not exceed the reasonable value of
153 the work in material noncompliance with the terms of the
154 construction contract.
155 (2) If an owner intends to withhold all or part of the
156 amount invoiced by or subject to, the contractor's pay
157 application, the owner shall give notice to the contractor
158 in writing of its intention to withhold all or part of the
159 contractor's payment. Such notice shall be given within
160 fifteen days after the owner receives the contractor's
161 invoice or pay application and shall provide:
162 (a) The amount the owner intends to withhold;
163 (b) The specific reasons why the owner intends to
164 withhold payment identifying the work that is believed to be
165 materially noncompliant;
166 (c) The name of the party and trade responsible for
167 the noncompliant work with sufficient information to allow
168 the contractor to determine which, if any, subcontractor, or
169 supplier may be responsible for the materially noncompliant
170 work; and
171 (d) The extent or percentage of the amount withheld,
172 apportioned between all parties and trades, if more than
173 one, believed to be ultimately responsible for the
174 materially noncompliant work. Any notice that fails to
175 reasonably apportion responsibility between or among
176 multiple parties and trades shall be deemed to be null and
177 void and ineffective.
SB 1257 7
178 Failure by the owner to give the notice within fifteen days
179 after the owner receives the contractor's invoice or pay
180 application shall be deemed to be acceptance of the
181 contractor's pay application in full, subject only to the
182 owner's right to claim later that materially noncompliant
183 work was subsequently discovered and that such work was not
184 reasonably discoverable prior to the date for giving such
185 notice.
186 5. (1) In any construction contract between a
187 contractor and a subcontractor, the parties shall include a
188 provision that requires the contractor to pay the
189 subcontractor within seven days after receipt of payment
190 from the owner for the subcontractor's work. Any
191 construction contract that does not contain such a provision
192 shall be deemed to include such provision notwithstanding
193 any language to the contrary contained in the construction
194 contract or other contract documents incorporated therein or
195 otherwise governing the construction contract. Within two
196 business days after receipt of payment from the owner for
197 one or more subcontractors' work, the contractor shall
198 notify each subcontractor in writing, or electronically, of
199 the amount of payment received by the contractor for such
200 subcontractor's work. The contractor shall within seven
201 days of receipt of funds from the owner remit to each
202 subcontractor its full share of the sum received by the
203 contractor from the owner for the subcontractor's work. Any
204 funds received by the contractor from the owner for a
205 subcontractor's work which the owner does not intend to pay
206 to the subcontractor shall promptly be returned to the owner.
207 (2) If an owner withholds all or part of the amount
208 invoiced by, or subject to, the contractor's pay application
209 or gives notice of its intent to do so as provided in
SB 1257 8
210 subsection 4 of this section, the contractor shall within
211 seven days after receipt of such information or notice,
212 provide a copy of the notice or information to each
213 subcontractor affected thereby. The failure by the
214 contractor to give such notice or information to the
215 subcontractor, within seven days after receipt of such
216 notice or information from the owner, shall be deemed to be
217 acceptance by the contractor of the subcontractor's invoice
218 or pay application, subject only to the contractor's right
219 to claim later that materially noncompliant work was
220 subsequently discovered and that such work was not
221 reasonably discoverable prior to the date for giving the
222 notice or information.
223 (3) Partial payment by the owner to the contractor
224 shall not be a basis for the contractor to withhold more
225 from the subcontractor than the owner withheld from the
226 contractor for the subcontractor's work. The contractor
227 shall not withhold from the subcontractor any more than the
228 owner identifies as the responsibility of the subcontractor.
229 (4) A sub-subcontractor or supplier shall have the
230 same rights and responsibilities in relation to its
231 subcontractor as the subcontractor has to its contractor.
232 (5) All rights and responsibilities shall flow down to
233 all parties in the construction contract chain no matter the
234 tier. A lower tier subcontractor or supplier, at whatever
235 tier, shall have the same rights and responsibilities in
236 relationship to the party with whom it has a construction
237 contract as that party has with another party with whom it
238 has a construction contract, including, but not limited to,
239 the following construction contract chains:
SB 1257 9
240 (a) A subcontractor to a contractor shall have the
241 same rights and responsibilities as to the contractor as the
242 contractor has in its relationship with the owner;
243 (b) A supplier to a subcontractor shall have the same
244 rights and responsibilities as to the subcontractor as the
245 subcontractor has in its relationship with the contractor;
246 and
247 (c) A supplier to a contractor shall have the same
248 rights and responsibilities as to the contractor as the
249 contractor has in its relationship with the owner.
250 6. The provisions of this section shall not apply to
251 the repair or remodeling of, or the addition to any owner-
252 occupied residential property of four units or less where
253 the owner currently occupies, or intends to occupy and does
254 occupy as a residence within a reasonable time after the
255 completion of the repair, remodeling, or addition which is
256 the subject of the construction contract.
257 7. The provisions of this section shall apply only to
258 construction contracts and other agreements, provisions,
259 covenants, clauses, or understandings entered into on or
260 after August 28, 2024.
