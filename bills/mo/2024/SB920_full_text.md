SB 920 10
269 (2) If the department determines that a sponsor is in
270 material noncompliance with its sponsorship duties, the
271 sponsor shall be notified and given reasonable time for
272 remediation. If remediation does not address the compliance
273 issues identified by the department, the commissioner of
274 education shall conduct a public hearing and thereafter
275 provide notice to the charter sponsor of corrective action
276 that will be recommended to the state board of education.
277 Corrective action by the department may include withholding
278 the sponsor's funding and suspending the sponsor's authority
279 to sponsor a school that it currently sponsors or to sponsor
280 any additional school until the sponsor is reauthorized by
281 the state board of education under section 160.403.
282 (3) The charter sponsor may, within thirty days of
283 receipt of the notice of the commissioner's recommendation,
284 provide a written statement and other documentation to show
285 cause as to why that action should not be taken. Final
286 determination of corrective action shall be determined by
287 the state board of education based upon a review of the
288 documentation submitted to the department and the charter
289 sponsor.
290 (4) If the state board removes the authority to
291 sponsor a currently operating charter school under any
292 provision of law, the Missouri charter public school
293 commission shall become the sponsor of the school.
294 18. If a sponsor notifies a charter school of closure
295 under subsection 8 of section 160.405, the department of
296 elementary and secondary education shall exercise its
297 financial withholding authority under subsection 12 of
298 section 160.415 to assure all obligations of the charter
299 school shall be met. The state, charter sponsor, or
SB 920 11
300 resident district shall not be liable for any outstanding
301 liability or obligations of the charter school.
