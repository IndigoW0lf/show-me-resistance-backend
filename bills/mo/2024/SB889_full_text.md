13 owner to determine whether or not his property is within the
14 district, and a plat of the proposed district;
15 (5) The wards shall be compact and contiguous and
16 contain equal populations as nearly as possible, and shall

23 (7) A prayer for the organization of the district.
1 85.1030. No petition with the requisite signatures
2 shall be declared null and void on account of alleged
3 defects, but the county clerk may at any time permit the
4 petition to be amended to conform with the facts, by
5 correcting any errors in the description of the territory,
6 or in any other particular, except that the boundaries of
7 the district may not be enlarged by taking in additional
8 territory, without notice to the owners of the property thus
9 affected, which notice may be made by publication or service
10 of such pleadings and orders on the owners so affected.
11 Similar petitions or duplicate copies of the same petition
12 for the organization of the same district, revising the

14 chosen name for the district, may be filed at any time
15 before a hearing is had on the petition, and shall, together

3 been filed shall thereafter for all purposes of sections
4 85.1000 to 85.1400, except as otherwise provided, maintain

3 and presented pursuant to the provisions of sections 85.1000
4 to 85.1400, and that the allegations of the petition are
5 true, the county clerk shall, by order duly entered of
6 record, adjudicate all questions of jurisdiction, declare

4 it shall dismiss the proceedings and adjudge the costs
5 against the sponsors of the petition, or petitions, in such
6 proportion as it deems just and equitable. Nothing herein
7 shall be construed to prevent the filing of a subsequent
8 petition, or petitions, for similar improvements or for a
9 similar district, and the right so to renew such proceeding
10 is hereby expressly granted and authorized.

113 benefits shall be determined by the board of directors of
114 the police protection district within the level of available
115 revenues of the pension program and other available revenues
116 of the district. If an employee contributory plan is
SB 889 19
117 adopted, then at least one voting member of the board of
118 trustees shall be a member of the police district elected by
119 the contributing members, which shall not be the same as the

141 her support. The type and amount of such benefits shall be
142 determined by the board of directors of the police
143 protection district within available revenues of the
144 district, including the pension program of the district.
145 The provision and receipt of such benefits shall not make
146 the recipient an employee of the district. Directors who
147 are also volunteer members may receive such benefits while

10 district, per one hundred dollars of assessed value in such
11 area. The tax rate so computed shall include any tax on

7 event, the municipality and the police protection district
8 shall, by ordinance duly enacted by the governing board of
SB 889 21
9 each, agree upon the terms by which such police protection

1 85.1145. To levy and collect taxes as herein provided,
2 the board shall in each year determine the amount of money
3 necessary to be raised by taxation, and shall fix a rate of

20 petition shall describe the property to be included in the
21 district and shall describe the property owned by the
22 petitioners and shall be deemed to give assent of the
23 petitioners to the inclusion in the district of the property
24 described in the petition; and such petition shall be in
SB 889 33
25 substantially the form set forth in section 85.1290 dealing
26 with referendums and verified in like manner; provided,
27 however, that in the event that there are more than twenty-
28 five property owners or taxpaying electors signing the
29 petition, it shall be deemed sufficient description of their
30 property in the petition as required in this section to list
31 the addresses of such property; or
32 (2) All of the owners of any territory or tract of
33 land near or adjacent to a police protection district who
34 own all of the real estate in such territory or tract of
35 land may file a petition with the board praying that such
36 real property be included in the district. The petition
37 shall describe the property owned by the petitioners and
38 shall be deemed to give assent of the petitioners to the
39 inclusion in the district of the property described in the
40 petition.
41 3. The secretary of the board shall cause notice of
42 the filing of any petition filed pursuant to this section to
43 be given and published in the county in which the property
44 is located, which notice shall recite the filing of such
45 petition, the number of petitioners, a general description
46 of the boundaries of the area proposed to be included, and
47 the prayer of the petitioners; giving notice to all persons
48 interested to appear at the office of the board at the time
49 named in the notice and show cause in writing, if any they
50 have, why the petition should not be granted. The board
51 shall at the time and place mentioned, or at such time or
52 times to which the hearing may be adjourned, proceed to hear
53 the petition and all objections thereto presented in writing
54 by any person showing cause why the petition should not be
55 granted. The failure of any person interested to show cause
56 in writing why such petition shall not be granted shall be
SB 889 34
57 deemed as an assent on his or her part to the inclusion of
58 such lands in the district as prayed for in the petition.
59 4. If the board deems it for the best interest of the
60 district, it shall grant the petition, but if the board
61 determines that some portion of the property mentioned in
62 the petition cannot as a practical matter be served by the
63 district, or if it deems it for the best interest of the
64 district that some portion of the property in the petition
65 not be included in the district, then the board shall grant
66 the petition in part only. If the petition is granted, the
67 board shall make an order to that effect and file the same
68 with the county clerk; and upon the order of the county
69 having jurisdiction over the district, the property shall be
70 included in the district. If the petition contains the
71 signatures of all the owners of the property pursuant to the
72 provisions of subdivision (2) of subsection 2 of this
73 section, the property shall be included in the district upon
74 the order of the county. If the petition contains the
75 signatures of twenty-five percent of the number of voters
76 who voted in the most recent gubernatorial election in the
77 area to be annexed pursuant to subdivision (1) or
78 subdivision (3) of subsection 2 of this section, the
79 property shall be included in the district subject to the
80 election provided in section 85.1200. The county having
81 jurisdiction over the district shall proceed to make any
82 such order including such additional property within the
83 district as is provided in the order of the board, unless
84 the county clerk shall find that such order of the board was
85 not authorized by law or that such order of the board was
86 not supported by competent and substantial evidence.
87 5. Any person aggrieved by any decision of the board
88 made pursuant to the provisions of this section may appeal
SB 889 35
89 that decision to a court of competent jurisdiction of the
90 county in which the property is located within thirty days
91 of the decision by the board.
92 6. No police protection district, or employee thereof,
93 in which territory is annexed pursuant to this section shall
94 be required to comply with any prescribed law enforcement
95 officer training program or regimen which would not
96 otherwise apply to the district or its employees, but for
97 the requirements applicable to the annexed territory.
1 85.1200. 1. If the petition to add any territory or
2 tract of land to the district contained fewer than all of
3 the signatures required pursuant to subdivision (2) of
4 subsection 2 of section 85.1195, the decree of extension of
5 boundaries shall not become final and conclusive until it
6 has been submitted to an election of the voters residing
7 within the boundaries described in such decree and until it
8 has been assented to by a majority vote of the voters in the
9 newly included area voting on the question. The decree
10 shall also provide for the holding of the election to vote
11 on the proposition of extending the boundaries of the
12 district, and shall fix the date for holding the election.

20 proposition vote in favor of the extension of the boundaries
21 of the district, then the county clerk shall enter its
22 further order declaring the decree of extension of the
SB 889 36
23 boundaries to be final and conclusive. In the event,
24 however, that the county clerk finds that a majority of the
25 voters voting thereon voted against the proposition to
26 extend the boundaries of the district, then the county shall
27 enter its further order declaring the decree of extension of
28 boundaries to be void and of no effect.
1 85.1205. Within thirty days after the final order of
2 the county extending the boundaries of the district, the
3 county clerk of that county shall transmit to the county
4 clerk and to the recorder of deeds in each county in which
5 the district is located copies of the findings and decrees
6 of the county extending the boundaries of the district. The
7 same shall be filed in the same manner as articles of
8 incorporation are required to be filed under the general
9 laws concerning corporations, and each recorder and clerk
10 shall receive a fee of one dollar for filing and preserving
11 the same.
1 85.1210. The boundaries of a police protection
2 district shall be coterminous with and include the whole of

4 protection district. Upon the voters adopting a police
5 protection district, any municipal police department
6 contained within said district shall be dissolved, merged
7 with, and absorbed by the police protection district.
1 85.1215. All real property included within, or
2 excluded from, a district shall thereafter be subject to the
3 levy of taxes for the payment of any indebtedness of the
4 district outstanding at the time of inclusion or exclusion;
5 provided, however, that after any real property shall have
6 been excluded from a district, as herein provided, any
7 buildings and improvements thereafter erected or constructed
8 on said excluded real property, and all machinery and
SB 889 37

13 connection with said real property, shall not be subject to
14 any taxes levied by said district.

5 percent per annum, payable semiannually, and shall be due

7 commencing not later than three years and extending not more
8 than twenty years from their date. The form and terms of
9 said bonds, including provisions for their payment and
10 redemption, shall be determined by the board. If the board
11 so determines, such bonds may be redeemable prior to
12 maturity upon payment of a premium, not exceeding three
13 percent of the principal thereof. Said bonds shall be
14 executed in the name of and on behalf of the district and

18 board shall determine and the bonds and coupons thereto
19 attached shall be payable to bearer. Interest coupons shall
20 bear the original or facsimile signature of the chairman of
21 the board.
1 85.1225. Whenever any board shall, by resolution,
2 determine that the interest of said district and the public
3 interest or necessity demand the acquisition, construction,
4 installation, or completion of any works or other
5 improvements or facilities, or the making of any contract
SB 889 38
6 with the United States or other persons or corporations, to
7 carry out the objects or purposes of said district,
8 requiring the creation of an indebtedness in an amount
9 exceeding in any year the income and revenue provided for
10 such year plus any unencumbered balances from previous
11 years, said board shall order the submission of the
12 proposition of issuing such obligations or bonds, or
13 creating other indebtedness, to the voters of the election.
14 The declaration of public interest or necessity herein
15 required and the provision for holding of such election may
16 be included within one and the same resolution, which
17 resolution, in addition to such declaration of public
18 interest or necessity, shall recite the objects and purposes
19 for which the indebtedness is proposed to be incurred, the
20 estimated cost of the works or improvements, as the case may
21 be, the amount of principal of the indebtedness to be
22 incurred therefor, and the maximum rate of interest to be
23 paid on such indebtedness. Such resolution shall also fix
24 the date upon which such election shall be held.

2 returns that the constitutionally required percentage of the
SB 889 39
3 voters of the district who shall have voted on any such
4 proposition submitted hereunder at such election voted in
5 favor of such proposition, the district shall thereupon be
6 authorized to incur such indebtedness or obligations, enter
7 into such contract or issue, and sell such bonds of the
8 district, as the case may be, all for the purpose or
9 purposes and object or objects provided for in the
10 proposition or propositions submitted hereunder and in the
11 resolution therefor, and in the amount so provided and at a
12 rate of interest not exceeding the rate of interest recited
13 in such resolution. Submission of the proposition of
14 incurring such obligation or bonded or other indebtedness at
15 such an election shall not prevent or prohibit submission of
16 the same or other propositions at a subsequent election.
1 85.1245. Whenever a petition signed by not less than
2 twenty-five percent of the voters who cast votes at the last
3 election for the district director in any district organized

3 make an order reciting the same and providing for the
4 submission of the proposition to dissolve such district to a
5 vote of the voters of the district, setting forth such
6 further details in its order as may be necessary to an
7 orderly conduct of such election. Such election shall be
8 held at the municipal election. Returns of said election

13 district, and the decree shall contain a proviso that said
14 district shall continue in full force for the purpose of
15 paying all outstanding and lawful obligations and disposing
16 of property of the district; but no additional costs or
17 obligations shall be created except such as are necessary to
18 pay such costs, obligations, and liabilities theretofore
19 incurred, or necessary to the winding up of the district.
20 If the county clerk shall find that two-thirds of the voters
21 of the district voting thereon shall not have voted
22 favorably on the proposition to dissolve such district, then
23 the county shall make a final order declaring such result
24 dismissing the petition praying for the dissolution of said
25 district; and the said district shall continue to operate in
26 the same manner as though said petition asking for such
27 dissolution has not been filed.

2 provided for in sections 85.1000 to 85.1400, if the county
3 clerk finds for any reason that due notice was not given,
4 the county clerk shall not thereby lose jurisdiction, and
