Be it enacted by the General Assembly of the state of Missouri, as follows:
Section A. Sections 644.041 and 644.051, RSMo, are repealed and two new sections
2 enacted in lieu thereof, to be known as sections 644.041 and 644.051, to read as follows:
644.041. 1. As promptly as possible the commission shall adopt and promulgate
2 reasonable effluent, pretreatment and toxic material control regulations which require the use
3 of effective treatment facilities, or other methods to prevent water contamination, for each
4 and every significant source, potential source, and classification of sources of water
5 contaminants, or to limit or prevent introduction of water contaminants into publicly owned
6 treatment works or facilities as required under any federal water pollution control act,
7 throughout the state and thereafter may modify such regulations from time to time.
8 2. Any land application of industrial wastewater, industrial wastewater
9 treatment sludge, and related process wastes shall be subject to a nutrient
10 management technical standard established by the department, which shall include
11 land application practices, setbacks, and a process for establishing land application
12 rates. The department shall create, maintain, and incorporate into rule a separate
13 nutrient management technical standard for industrial facilities that are not
14 concentrated animal feeding operations. The department may require surface water
15 sampling and groundwater monitoring wells on a site-specific basis when, in the
16 determination of the division of Missouri geological survey, the land application fields
17 are located in hydrologically sensitive areas where the groundwater may be

141 permittee to notify the clean water commission of any substantial change in volume or
142 character of water contaminants or pollutants being introduced into its treatment works or
143 facility by a source which was introducing water contaminants or pollutants into its works at
144 the time of issuance of the permit. Notice must describe the quality and quantity of effluent
145 being introduced or to be introduced into such works or facility by a source which was
146 introducing water contaminants or pollutants into its works at the time of issuance of the
HB 2134 6
147 permit. Notice must describe the quality and quantity of effluent being introduced or to be
148 introduced into such works or facility and the anticipated impact of such introduction on the
149 quality or quantity of effluent to be released from such works or facility into waters of the
150 state.
151 [15.] 17. The director or the commission may require the filing or posting of a bond
152 as a condition for the issuance of permits for construction of temporary or future water
153 treatment facilities or facilities that utilize innovative technology for wastewater treatment in
154 an amount determined by the commission to be sufficient to ensure compliance with all
155 provisionsofsections644.006to644.141,andanyrulesorregulationsofthecommissionand
156 any condition as to such construction in the permit. For the purposes of this section,
157 "innovative technology for wastewater treatment" shall mean a completely new and generally
158 unproven technology in the type or method of its application that bench testing or theory
159 suggest has environmental, efficiency, and cost benefits beyond the standard technologies.
160 No bond shall be required for designs approved by any federal agency or environmental
161 regulatory agency of another state. The bond shall be signed by the applicant as principal,
