35 5. Each trustee shall be entitled to one vote on the

37 trustees at any meeting of the board.
38 6. Notwithstanding any provision of sections 87.120 to
39 87.371 to the contrary, the board of trustees of the
40 retirement system shall not be prevented from simultaneously
41 acting as the trustees of any other pension plan that
42 provides retirement, disability, and death benefits for
43 firefighters employed by any city not within a county and
44 their covered dependents. The administration of the other
45 pension plan shall be in accordance with the terms of such
46 pension plan.
1 87.145. The board of trustees shall have exclusive
2 original jurisdiction in all matters relating to or
3 affecting the funds herein provided for, including, in
SB 1404 3
4 addition to all other matters, all claims for benefits and

12 funds created by this law, for the transaction of its
13 business, and for the limitation of the time within which
14 claims may be filed. The administration of any pension
15 plan, other than the retirement system, includes the ability
16 of the board of trustees, from time to time, to establish
17 rules and regulations for the administration of funds of
18 such other pension plan and for the transaction of such
19 other pension plan's business.
1 87.155. 1. The board of trustees shall keep in
2 convenient form such data as is necessary for actuarial

12 actuarial valuation of the assets and liabilities of the
13 retirement system.
14 3. To the extent the board of trustees administers a
15 pension plan other than the retirement system, the board of

16 trustees shall maintain separate records of all proceedings
17 of such other pension plan.
1 87.260. The board of trustees of the firefighters'
2 retirement system shall have the exclusive authority and
3 discretion to invest and reinvest the funds in property of
4 any kind, real or personal. The board of trustees shall
5 invest and manage the fund as a prudent investor would, by
6 considering the purposes, terms, distribution requirements,
7 and other circumstances of the firefighters' retirement
8 system. In satisfying this standard, the board of trustees
9 shall exercise reasonable care, skill, and caution. No
10 trustee shall have any interest as a trustee in the gains or
11 profits made on any investment, except benefits from
12 interest in investments common to all members of the plan,
13 if entitled thereto. To the extent the board of trustees
14 administers a pension plan other than the retirement system,
15 the board of trustees shall also have the authority and
16 discretion to invest and reinvest the funds of such other
17 pension plan in property of any kind, real or personal. The
18 board of trustees may choose to invest the funds of the
19 retirement system and the funds of the other pension plan in
20 the same investments so long as the amounts invested and the
21 gains, profits, or losses on such investments are accounted
22 for separately. No benefits due to the firefighters or
23 their covered dependents from the other pension plan shall
24 be paid from the funds of the retirement system.
1 87.350. The expense fund shall be the fund to which
2 shall be credited all money provided to pay the
3 administration expenses of the retirement system and from
4 which shall be paid all the expenses necessary in connection
5 with the administration and operation of the system.
6 Annually the board of trustees shall estimate the amount of
SB 1404 5
7 money necessary to be paid into the expense fund during the
8 ensuing year to provide for the expense of operation of the
9 retirement system. Such estimate shall be provided by the
10 board of trustees from interest and other earnings on assets
11 of the retirement system. In no event shall any expenses,
12 including administrative expenses, incurred by the board of
13 trustees in the administration of any pension plan other
14 than the retirement system or in the investment of any funds
15 of any pension plan other than the retirement system be paid
16 from the funds of the retirement system. Such expenses
17 shall be paid entirely from the funds of the other pension
18 plan.
