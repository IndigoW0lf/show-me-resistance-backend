SENATE CONCURRENT RESOLUTION NO. 37
Whereas, the state of Missouri values its sovereignty
and independence; and
Whereas, the citizens of Missouri are increasingly
alarmed by the influence of international organizations like
the World Health Organization, the United Nations and the
World Economic Forum in this state; and
Whereas, a number of recent proposals supported by the
United Nations and the World Economic Forum are deeply
concerning, including but not limited to:
(1) The promotion of insect-based foods as a
replacement for traditional meat products, limiting food
choice and infringing on personal dietary preferences and
traditions;
(2) The imposition of ESG, or environmental, social,
and corporate governance, requirements on businesses that
increase regulations, raise costs, and reduce economic
freedom for entrepreneurs and businesses;
(3) The concept of social credit, akin to a credit
score for social behaviors, that gives the government undue
control over individuals' daily lives, punishing those who
dissent or hold differing views;
(4) Advocacy for censorship, including government
preapproval of information shared online, on social media,
and on television that threatens the fundamental principles
of free speech and stifles open discourse;
(5) Support for global medical mandates, such as
lockdowns, travel bans, business closures, and medical
passports, that infringe on individual liberties and
personal autonomy;
1
(6) The endorsement of digital identification that
records and tracks individuals' activities, raising concerns
about mass surveillance and the erosion of personal privacy;
(7) The potential implementation of mass surveillance
technologies, including facial recognition cameras and
biometric implants, that pose significant threats to
personal privacy and civil liberties;
(8) Placing onerous burdens, costs, and regulations on
farmers in the name of sustainability goals that jeopardize
agricultural practices and the livelihoods of farmers;
(9) The advocacy for the elimination of private
property rights, which undermines the principles of
individual ownership and personal freedom; and
(10) The introduction of central bank digital
currencies (CBDCs), programmable currency controlled by
central banks, that grant the government instant visibility
and control over citizens' finances, infringing on financial
privacy and personal autonomy:
Now, Therefore, Be It Resolved that the members of the
Missouri Senate, One Hundred and Second General Assembly,
Second Regular Session, the House of Representatives
concurring therein, that the General Assembly firmly
reasserts its unwavering dedication to the principles of
sovereignty and self-determination, declaring unequivocally
that any encroachments on the freedom of its residents must
be immediately stopped; and
Be It Further Resolved that the General Assembly openly
voices its concerns regarding all attempts made by
international organizations, including but not limited to
the United Nations, the World Economic Forum, and the World
Health Organization, to advocate for policies and
2
initiatives that could undermine the core values and
interests of Missouri's residents; and
Be It Further Resolved that the General Assembly
strongly encourages a comprehensive review of all agreements
or partnerships involving international organizations to
guarantee their alignment with the fundamental principles of
individual freedom, privacy, autonomy, and the right to
private property, which are cherished by the people of
Missouri; and
Be It Further Resolved that the General Assembly
remains resolute in its commitment to engaging in
international cooperation as long as such endeavors respect
the autonomy and sovereignty of our great state; and
Be It Further Resolved that the Secretary of the Senate
be instructed to prepare a properly inscribed copy of this
resolution for the Governor and Missouri's Congressional
delegation.
