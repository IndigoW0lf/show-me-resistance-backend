6 (1) An in-person encounter through a medical interview
7 and physical examination;
8 (2) Consultation with another physician, or that
9 physician's delegate, who has an established relationship
10 with the patient and an agreement with the physician to

13 does not require an in-person encounter, and in accordance
14 with evidence-based standards of practice and telemedicine
15 practice guidelines that address the clinical and
16 technological aspects of telemedicine.
17 2. In order to establish a physician-patient

24 prescriptions or physician certifications under Article XIV
25 of the Missouri Constitution, a physician who uses

28 sufficient for the diagnosis and treatment of the patient.
29 [A] Any questionnaire completed by the patient, whether via
30 the internet or telephone, shall include such information
31 sufficient to provide the information as though the medical
32 interview has been performed in person, otherwise such

2 substance, or other treatment through telemedicine, as
