Section A. Sections 287.120, 287.230, 287.240, and 537.610, RSMo, are repealed

3 287.240, and 537.610, to read as follows:
287.120. 1. Every employer subject to the provisions of this chapter shall be liable,
2 irrespective of negligence, to furnish compensation under the provisions of this chapter for
3 personal injury or death of the employee by accident or occupational disease arising out of
4 and in the course of the employee's employment. Any employee of such employer shall not
5 beliableforany injuryordeathfor whichcompensationisrecoverableunderthis chapterand
6 every employer and employees of such employer shall be released from all other liability
7 whatsoever, whether to the employee or any other person, except that an employee shall not
8 be released from liability for injury or death if the employee engaged in an affirmative
9 negligent act that purposefully and dangerously caused or increased the risk of injury. The
10 term "accident" as used in this section shall include, but not be limited to, injury or death of
11 the employee caused by the unprovoked violence or assault against the employee by any
12 person.
13 2. The rights and remedies herein granted to an employee shall exclude all other
14 rights and remedies of the employee, the employee's spouse, parents, personal
15 representatives, dependents, heirs or next kin, at common law or otherwise, on account of
EXPLANATION â€” Matter enclosed in bold-faced brackets [thus] in the above bill is not enacted and is

HB 2483 2
16 such injury or death by accident or occupational disease, except such rights and remedies as
17 are not provided for by this chapter.
18 3. No compensation shall be allowed under this chapter for the injury or death due to
19 the employee's intentional self-inflicted injury, but the burden of proof of intentional self-
20 inflicted injury shall be on the employer or the person contesting the claim for allowance.
21 4. Where the injury or death is caused by the failure of the employer to comply with
22 any safety standard issued by the employer or the occupational safety and health
23 administration, regulation, or statute in this state or any lawful order of the division or the
24 commission, the compensation and death benefit provided for under this chapter shall be
25 increased [fifteen] at least twenty-five but not more than fifty percent.
26 5. Where the injury is caused by the failure of the employee to use safety devices
27 where provided by the employer, or from the employee's failure to obey any reasonable rule
28 adopted by the employer for the safety of employees, the compensation and death benefit
29 provided for herein shall be reduced at least twenty-five but not more than fifty percent;
30 provided, that it is shown that the employee had actual knowledge of the rule so adopted by
31 the employer; and provided, further, that the employer had, prior to the injury, made a
32 reasonableefforttocausehisorheremployeestousethesafetydeviceordevicesandtoobey
33 or follow the rule so adopted for the safety of the employees.
34 6. (1) Where the employee fails to obey any rule or policy adopted by the employer
35 relating to a drug-free workplace or the use of alcohol or nonprescribed controlled drugs in
36 the workplace, the compensation and death benefit provided for herein shall be reduced fifty
37 percent if the injury was sustained in conjunction with the use of alcohol or nonprescribed
38 controlled drugs.
39 (2) If, however, the use of alcohol or nonprescribed controlled drugs in violation of
40 the employer's rule or policy is the proximate cause of the injury, then the benefits or
41 compensation otherwise payable under this chapter for death or disability shall be forfeited.
42 (3) The voluntary use of alcohol to the percentage of blood alcohol sufficient under
43 Missouri law to constitute legal intoxication shall give rise to a rebuttable presumption that
44 the voluntary use of alcohol under such circumstances was the proximate cause of the injury.
45 A preponderance of the evidence standard shall apply to rebut such presumption. An
46 employee's refusal to take a test for alcohol or a nonprescribed controlled substance, as
47 defined by section 195.010, at the request of the employer shall result in the forfeiture of
48 benefits under this chapter if the employer had sufficient cause to suspect use of alcohol or a
49 nonprescribed controlled substance by the claimant or if the employer's policy clearly
50 authorizes post-injury testing.
51 (4) Any positive test result for a nonprescribed controlled drug or the metabolites of
52 such drug from an employee shall give rise to a rebuttable presumption, which may be
HB 2483 3
53 rebutted by a preponderance of evidence, that the tested nonprescribed controlled drug was in
54 theemployee'ssystematthetimeoftheaccidentorinjuryandthattheinjurywassustainedin
55 conjunction with the use of the tested nonprescribed controlled drug if:
56 (a) The initial testing was administered within twenty-four hours of the accident or
57 injury;
58 (b) Notice was given to the employee of the test results within fourteen calendar days
59 of the insurer or group self-insurer receiving actual notice of the confirmatory test results;
60 (c) Theemployeewasgivenanopportunitytoperformasecondtestupontheoriginal
61 sample; and
62 (d) The initial or any subsequent testing that forms the basis of the presumption was
63 confirmed by mass spectrometry using generally accepted medical or forensic testing
64 procedures.
65 7. Where the employee's participation in a recreational activity or program is the
66 prevailing cause of the injury, benefits or compensation otherwise payable under this chapter
67 for death or disability shall be forfeited regardless that the employer may have promoted,
68 sponsored or supported the recreational activity or program, expressly or impliedly, in whole
69 or in part. The forfeiture of benefits or compensation shall not apply when:
70 (1) The employee was directly ordered by the employer to participate in such
71 recreational activity or program;
72 (2) The employee was paid wages or travel expenses while participating in such
73 recreational activity or program; or
74 (3) The injury from such recreational activity or program occurs on the employer's
75 premises due to an unsafe condition and the employer had actual knowledge of the
76 employee's participation in the recreational activity or program and of the unsafe condition of
77 the premises and failed to either curtail the recreational activity or program or cure the unsafe
78 condition.
79 8. Mental injury resulting from work-related stress does not arise out of and in the
80 course of the employment, unless it is demonstrated that the stress is work related and was
81 extraordinary and unusual. The amount of work stress shall be measured by objective
82 standards and actual events.
83 9. A mental injury is not considered to arise out of and in the course of the
84 employment if it resulted from any disciplinary action, work evaluation, job transfer, layoff,
85 demotion, termination or any similar action taken in good faith by the employer.
86 10. The ability of a firefighter to receive benefits for psychological stress under
87 section 287.067 shall not be diminished by the provisions of subsections 8 and 9 of this
88 section.
HB 2483 4
89 11. The provisions of subsection 2 of this section shall not apply to any cause of
90 action that may be brought on behalf of an unborn child or their representative in the
91 case of an injury or death which caused the death of an unborn child.
287.230. 1. (1) The death of the injured employee shall not affect the liability of the
2 employer to furnish compensation as in this chapter provided, so far as the liability has
3 accrued and become payable at the time of the death, and any accrued and unpaid
4 compensation due the employee shall be paid to his or her dependents without
5 administration, or if there are no dependents, to his or her personal representative, a
6 family member as defined under this subsection, or other persons entitled thereto, but the
7 death shall be deemed to be the termination of the disability.
8 (2) For the purposes of this subsection, the term "family member" shall include
9 the adult child or children, natural, illegitimate, adopted, or posthumous, who did not
10 qualify as a dependent under section 287.240 due to age or dependency; a parent of the
11 deceased, natural or adoptive; a grandparent of the deceased, natural or adoptive; a
12 sibling of the deceased; an adult next of kin; or the conservator of a dependent child if
13 such child has no representative to bring a claim on his or her own behalf.
14 2. Where an employee is entitled to compensation under this chapter, exclusive of
15 compensation as provided for in section 287.200, for an injury received and death ensues for
16 any cause not resulting from the injury for which the employee was entitled to compensation,
17 payments of the unpaid unaccrued compensation under section 287.190 and no other
18 compensation for the injury shall be paid to the surviving dependents at the time of death.
19 3. In applying the provisions of this chapter, it is the intent of the legislature to reject
20 andabrogate the holding in Schoemehlv. Treasurerof the Stateof Missouri,217 S.W.3d 900
21 (Mo. 2007), and all cases citing, interpreting, applying, or following this case.

19 registered mail, return receipt requested, or may be made by personal delivery;
20 (2) The employer shall also pay to the dependents of the employee a death benefit
21 based on the employee's average weekly earnings during the year immediately preceding the
22 injury that results in the death of the employee, as provided in section 287.250. The amount
23 of compensation for death, which shall be paid in installments in the same manner that
