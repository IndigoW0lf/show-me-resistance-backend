166 in good standing by fulfilling its sponsorship obligations
167 under sections 160.400 to 160.425 and 167.349 with regard to
168 each charter school it sponsors, including appropriate

184 terms;

191 renewal decisions.
192 [12.] 13. Sponsors receiving funds under subsection

196 section.
197 [13.] 14. No university, college or community college
198 shall grant a charter to a nonprofit corporation if an
199 employee of the university, college or community college is
200 a member of the corporation's board of directors.
201 [14.] 15. No sponsor shall grant a charter under
202 sections 160.400 to 160.425 and 167.349 without ensuring

204 registry check are conducted for all members of the
205 governing board of the charter schools or the incorporators
206 of the charter school if initial directors are not named in
207 the articles of incorporation, nor shall a sponsor renew a
SB 959 8
208 charter without ensuring a criminal background check and
209 family care safety registry check are conducted for each
210 member of the governing board of the charter school.
211 [15.] 16. No member of the governing board of a

215 in section 105.450, in any entity employed by or contracting
216 with the board. No board member shall be an employee of a
217 company that provides substantial services to the charter
218 school. All members of the governing board of the charter
219 school shall be considered decision-making public servants
220 as defined in section 105.450 for the purposes of the

229 program are aligned with the state standards and grade-level
230 expectations, and provides clear documentation of effective
231 governance and management structures, and a sustainable
232 operational plan;
233 (2) The granting of a charter;
234 (3) The performance contract that the sponsor will use
235 to evaluate the performance of charter schools. Charter
236 schools shall meet current state academic performance
237 standards as well as other standards agreed upon by the
238 sponsor and the charter school in the performance contract;
SB 959 9
239 (4) The sponsor's intervention, renewal, and
240 revocation policies, including the conditions under which
241 the charter sponsor may intervene in the operation of the

244 end of the term, consistent with subsections 8 and 9 of
245 section 160.405;
246 (5) Additional criteria that the sponsor will use for
247 ongoing oversight of the charter; and
248 (6) Procedures to be implemented if a charter school

250 (15) of subsection 1 of section 160.405.
251 The department shall provide guidance to sponsors in
252 developing such policies and procedures.
253 [17.] 18. (1) A sponsor shall provide timely
254 submission to the state board of education of all data
255 necessary to demonstrate that the sponsor is in material
256 compliance with all requirements of sections 160.400 to
257 160.425 and section 167.349. The state board of education
258 shall ensure each sponsor is in compliance with all
259 requirements under sections 160.400 to 160.425 and 167.349
260 for each charter school sponsored by any sponsor. The state
261 board shall notify each sponsor of the standards for
262 sponsorship of charter schools, delineating both what is
263 mandated by statute and what best practices dictate. The
264 state board shall evaluate sponsors to determine compliance
265 with these standards every three years. The evaluation
266 shall include a sponsor's policies and procedures in the
267 areas of charter application approval; required charter
268 agreement terms and content; sponsor performance evaluation
269 and compliance monitoring; and charter renewal,
SB 959 10
270 intervention, and revocation decisions. Nothing shall
271 preclude the department from undertaking an evaluation at
272 any time for cause.
273 (2) If the department determines that a sponsor is in
274 material noncompliance with its sponsorship duties, the
275 sponsor shall be notified and given reasonable time for
276 remediation. If remediation does not address the compliance
277 issues identified by the department, the commissioner of
278 education shall conduct a public hearing and thereafter
279 provide notice to the charter sponsor of corrective action
280 that will be recommended to the state board of education.
281 Corrective action by the department may include withholding
282 the sponsor's funding and suspending the sponsor's authority
283 to sponsor a school that it currently sponsors or to sponsor
284 any additional school until the sponsor is reauthorized by
285 the state board of education under section 160.403.
286 (3) The charter sponsor may, within thirty days of
287 receipt of the notice of the commissioner's recommendation,
288 provide a written statement and other documentation to show
289 cause as to why that action should not be taken. Final
290 determination of corrective action shall be determined by
291 the state board of education based upon a review of the
292 documentation submitted to the department and the charter
293 sponsor.
294 (4) If the state board removes the authority to
295 sponsor a currently operating charter school under any
296 provision of law, the Missouri charter public school
297 commission shall become the sponsor of the school.
298 [18.] 19. If a sponsor notifies a charter school of
299 closure under subsection 8 of section 160.405, the
300 department of elementary and secondary education shall
301 exercise its financial withholding authority under
SB 959 11
302 subsection 12 of section 160.415 to assure all obligations
303 of the charter school shall be met. The state, charter
304 sponsor, or resident district shall not be liable for any
305 outstanding liability or obligations of the charter school.
1 160.405. 1. A person, group or organization seeking
2 to establish a charter school shall submit the proposed
3 charter, as provided in this section, to a sponsor. If the
4 sponsor is not a school board, the applicant shall give a
5 copy of its application to the school board of the district
6 in which the charter school is to be located and to the
7 state board of education, within five business days of the
8 date the application is filed with the proposed sponsor.

10 sponsor, and, if a charter is granted, the school board may
11 file objections with the state board of education. The
12 charter shall include a legally binding performance contract
13 that describes the obligations and responsibilities of the
14 school and the sponsor as outlined in sections 160.400 to

102 2. Proposed charters shall be subject to the following
103 requirements:
104 (1) A charter shall be submitted to the sponsor, and
105 follow the sponsor's policies and procedures for review and
106 granting of a charter approval, and be approved by the state
107 board of education by January thirty-first prior to the
108 school year of the proposed opening date of the charter
109 school;
110 (2) A charter may be approved when the sponsor
111 determines that the requirements of this section are met,
112 determines that the applicant is sufficiently qualified to
113 operate a charter school, and that the proposed charter is
114 consistent with the sponsor's charter sponsorship goals and
115 capacity. The sponsor's decision of approval or denial
116 shall be made within ninety days of the filing of the
117 proposed charter;
118 (3) If the charter is denied, the proposed sponsor
119 shall notify the applicant in writing as to the reasons for
120 its denial and forward a copy to the state board of
121 education within five business days following the denial;
SB 959 15
122 (4) If a proposed charter is denied by a sponsor, the
123 proposed charter may be submitted to the state board of
124 education, along with the sponsor's written reasons for its
125 denial. If the state board determines that the applicant
126 meets the requirements of this section, that the applicant
127 is sufficiently qualified to operate the charter school, and
128 that granting a charter to the applicant would be likely to
129 provide educational benefit to the children of the district,
130 the state board may grant a charter and act as sponsor of
131 the charter school. The state board shall review the
132 proposed charter and make a determination of whether to deny
133 or grant the proposed charter within sixty days of receipt
134 of the proposed charter, provided that any charter to be
135 considered by the state board of education under this
136 subdivision shall be submitted no later than March first
137 prior to the school year in which the charter school intends
138 to begin operations. The state board of education shall
139 notify the applicant in writing as the reasons for its
140 denial, if applicable; and
141 (5) The sponsor of a charter school shall give
142 priority to charter school applicants that propose a school
143 oriented to high-risk students and to the reentry of
144 dropouts into the school system. If a sponsor grants three
145 or more charters, at least one-third of the charters granted
146 by the sponsor shall be to schools that actively recruit
147 dropouts or high-risk students as their student body and
148 address the needs of dropouts or high-risk students through
149 their proposed mission, curriculum, teaching methods, and
150 services. For purposes of this subsection, a "high-risk"
151 student is one who is at least one year behind in
152 satisfactory completion of course work or obtaining high
153 school credits for graduation, has dropped out of school, is
SB 959 16
154 at risk of dropping out of school, needs drug and alcohol
155 treatment, has severe behavioral problems, has been
156 suspended from school three or more times, has a history of
157 severe truancy, is a pregnant or parenting teen, has been
158 referred for enrollment by the judicial system, is exiting
159 incarceration, is a refugee, is homeless or has been
160 homeless sometime within the preceding six months, has been
161 referred by an area school district for enrollment in an
162 alternative program, or qualifies as high risk under
163 department of elementary and secondary education
164 guidelines. Dropout shall be defined through the guidelines
165 of the school core data report. The provisions of this
166 subsection do not apply to charters sponsored by the state
167 board of education.
168 3. If a charter is approved by a sponsor, the charter
169 application shall be submitted to the state board of
170 education, along with a statement of finding by the sponsor
171 that the application meets the requirements of sections
172 160.400 to 160.425 and section 167.349 and a monitoring plan
173 under which the charter sponsor shall evaluate the academic
174 performance, including annual performance reports, of
175 students enrolled in the charter school. The state board of
176 education shall approve or deny a charter application within
177 sixty days of receipt of the application. The state board
178 of education may deny a charter on grounds that the
179 application fails to meet the requirements of sections
180 160.400 to 160.425 and section 167.349 or that a charter
181 sponsor previously failed to meet the statutory
182 responsibilities of a charter sponsor. Any denial of a
183 charter application made by the state board of education
184 shall be in writing and shall identify the specific failures
185 of the application to meet the requirements of sections
SB 959 17
186 160.400 to 160.425 and section 167.349, and the written
187 denial shall be provided within ten business days to the
188 sponsor.
189 4. A charter school shall, as provided in its charter:
190 (1) Be nonsectarian in its programs, admission
191 policies, employment practices, and all other operations;
192 (2) Comply with laws and regulations of the state,
193 county, or city relating to health, safety, and state
194 minimum educational standards, as specified by the state
195 board of education, including the requirements relating to
196 student discipline under sections 160.261, 167.161, 167.164,
197 and 167.171, notification of criminal conduct to law
198 enforcement authorities under sections 167.115 to 167.117,

201 school time required under section 171.031, and the employee
202 criminal history background check and the family care safety
203 registry check under section 168.133;
204 (3) Except as provided in sections 160.400 to 160.425
205 and as specifically provided in other sections, be exempt
206 from all laws and rules relating to schools, governing
207 boards and school districts;
208 (4) Be financially accountable, use practices
209 consistent with the Missouri financial accounting manual,
210 provide for an annual audit by a certified public
211 accountant, publish audit reports and annual financial
212 reports as provided in chapter 165, provided that the annual
213 financial report may be published on the department of
214 elementary and secondary education's internet website in
215 addition to other publishing requirements, and provide
216 liability insurance to indemnify the school, its board,
217 staff and teachers against tort claims. A charter school
SB 959 18
218 that receives local educational agency status under
219 subsection 6 of this section shall meet the requirements
220 imposed by the Elementary and Secondary Education Act for
221 audits of such agencies and comply with all federal audit
222 requirements for charters with local educational agency
223 status. For purposes of an audit by petition under section
224 29.230, a charter school shall be treated as a political
225 subdivision on the same terms and conditions as the school
226 district in which it is located. For the purposes of
227 securing such insurance, a charter school shall be eligible
228 for the Missouri public entity risk management fund pursuant
229 to section 537.700. A charter school that incurs debt shall
230 include a repayment plan in its financial plan;
231 (5) Provide a comprehensive program of instruction for
232 at least one grade or age group from early childhood through
233 grade twelve, as specified in its charter;
234 (6) (a) Design a method to measure pupil progress
235 toward the pupil academic standards adopted by the state
236 board of education pursuant to section 160.514, establish
237 baseline student performance in accordance with the
238 performance contract during the first year of operation,
239 collect student performance data as defined by the annual
240 performance report throughout the duration of the charter to
241 annually monitor student academic performance, and to the
242 extent applicable based upon grade levels offered by the
243 charter school, participate in the statewide system of
244 assessments, comprised of the essential skills tests and the
245 nationally standardized norm-referenced achievement tests,
246 as designated by the state board pursuant to section
247 160.518, complete and distribute an annual report card as
248 prescribed in section 160.522, which shall also include a
249 statement that background checks have been completed on the
SB 959 19
250 charter school's board members, and report to its sponsor,
251 the local school district, and the state board of education
252 as to its teaching methods and any educational innovations
253 and the results thereof. No charter school shall be
254 considered in the Missouri school improvement program review
255 of the district in which it is located for the resource or
256 process standards of the program.
257 (b) For proposed high-risk or alternative charter
258 schools, sponsors shall approve performance measures based
259 on mission, curriculum, teaching methods, and services.
260 Sponsors shall also approve comprehensive academic and
261 behavioral measures to determine whether students are
262 meeting performance standards on a different time frame as
263 specified in that school's charter. Student performance
264 shall be assessed comprehensively to determine whether a
265 high-risk or alternative charter school has documented
266 adequate student progress. Student performance shall be
267 based on sponsor-approved comprehensive measures as well as
268 standardized public school measures. Annual presentation of
269 charter school report card data to the department of
270 elementary and secondary education, the state board, and the
271 public shall include comprehensive measures of student
272 progress.
273 (c) Nothing in this subdivision shall be construed as
274 permitting a charter school to be held to lower performance
275 standards than other public schools within a district;
276 however, the charter of a charter school may permit students
277 to meet performance standards on a different time frame as
278 specified in its charter. The performance standards for
279 alternative and special purpose charter schools that target
280 high-risk students as defined in subdivision (5) of
281 subsection 2 of this section shall be based on measures
SB 959 20
282 defined in the school's performance contract with its
283 sponsors;
284 (7) Comply with all applicable federal and state laws
285 and regulations regarding students with disabilities,
286 including sections 162.670 to 162.710, the Individuals with
287 Disabilities Education Act (20 U.S.C. Section 1400) and
288 Section 504 of the Rehabilitation Act of 1973 (29 U.S.C.
289 Section 794) or successor legislation;
290 (8) Provide along with any request for review by the
291 state board of education the following:
292 (a) Documentation that the applicant has provided a
293 copy of the application to the school board of the district
294 in which the charter school is to be located, except in
295 those circumstances where the school district is the sponsor
296 of the charter school; and
297 (b) A statement outlining the reasons for approval or
298 denial by the sponsor, specifically addressing the
299 requirements of sections 160.400 to 160.425 and 167.349.
300 5. (1) Proposed or existing high-risk or alternative
301 charter schools may include alternative arrangements for
302 students to obtain credit for satisfying graduation
303 requirements in the school's charter application and
304 charter. Alternative arrangements may include, but not be
305 limited to, credit for off-campus instruction, embedded
306 credit, work experience through an internship arranged
307 through the school, and independent studies. When the state
308 board of education approves the charter, any such
309 alternative arrangements shall be approved at such time.
310 (2) The department of elementary and secondary
311 education shall conduct a study of any charter school
312 granted alternative arrangements for students to obtain
313 credit under this subsection after three years of operation
SB 959 21
314 to assess student performance, graduation rates, educational
315 outcomes, and entry into the workforce or higher education.
316 6. The charter of a charter school may be amended at
317 the request of the governing body of the charter school and
318 on the approval of the sponsor. The sponsor and the
319 governing board and staff of the charter school shall
320 jointly review the school's performance, management and
321 operations during the first year of operation and then every
322 other year after the most recent review or at any point
323 where the operation or management of the charter school is
324 changed or transferred to another entity, either public or
325 private. The governing board of a charter school may amend
326 the charter, if the sponsor approves such amendment, or the
327 sponsor and the governing board may reach an agreement in
328 writing to reflect the charter school's decision to become a
329 local educational agency. In such case the sponsor shall
330 give the department of elementary and secondary education
331 written notice no later than March first of any year, with
332 the agreement to become effective July first. The
333 department may waive the March first notice date in its
334 discretion. The department shall identify and furnish a
335 list of its regulations that pertain to local educational
336 agencies to such schools within thirty days of receiving
337 such notice.
338 7. Sponsors shall annually review the charter school's
339 compliance with statutory standards including:
340 (1) Participation in the statewide system of
341 assessments, as designated by the state board of education
342 under section 160.518;
343 (2) Assurances for the completion and distribution of
344 an annual report card as prescribed in section 160.522;
SB 959 22
345 (3) The collection of baseline data during the first
346 three years of operation to determine the longitudinal
347 success of the charter school;
348 (4) A method to measure pupil progress toward the
349 pupil academic standards adopted by the state board of
350 education under section 160.514; and
351 (5) Publication of each charter school's annual
352 performance report.
353 8. (1) (a) A sponsor's policies shall give schools
354 clear, adequate, evidence-based, and timely notice of
355 contract violations or performance deficiencies and mandate
356 intervention based upon findings of the state board of
357 education of the following:
358 a. The charter school provides a high school program
359 which fails to maintain a graduation rate of at least
360 seventy percent in three of the last four school years
361 unless the school has dropout recovery as its mission;
362 b. The charter school's annual performance report
363 results are below the district's annual performance report
364 results based on the performance standards that are
365 applicable to the grade level configuration of both the
366 charter school and the district in which the charter school
367 is located in three of the last four school years; and
368 c. The charter school is identified as a persistently
369 lowest achieving school by the department of elementary and
370 secondary education.
371 (b) A sponsor shall have a policy to revoke a charter
372 during the charter term if there is:
373 a. Clear evidence of underperformance as demonstrated
374 in the charter school's annual performance report in three
375 of the last four school years; or
SB 959 23
376 b. A violation of the law or the public trust that
377 imperils students or public funds.
378 (c) A sponsor shall revoke a charter or take other
379 appropriate remedial action, which may include placing the
380 charter school on probationary status for no more than
381 twenty-four months, provided that no more than one
382 designation of probationary status shall be allowed for the
383 duration of the charter contract, at any time if the charter
384 school commits a serious breach of one or more provisions of
385 its charter or on any of the following grounds: failure to
386 meet the performance contract as set forth in its charter,
387 failure to meet generally accepted standards of fiscal
388 management, failure to provide information necessary to
389 confirm compliance with all provisions of the charter and
390 sections 160.400 to 160.425 and 167.349 within forty-five
391 days following receipt of written notice requesting such
392 information, or violation of law.
393 (2) The sponsor may place the charter school on
394 probationary status to allow the implementation of a
395 remedial plan, which may require a change of methodology, a
396 change in leadership, or both, after which, if such plan is
397 unsuccessful, the charter may be revoked.
398 (3) At least sixty days before acting to revoke a
399 charter, the sponsor shall notify the governing board of the
400 charter school of the proposed action in writing. The
401 notice shall state the grounds for the proposed action. The
402 school's governing board may request in writing a hearing
403 before the sponsor within two weeks of receiving the notice.
404 (4) The sponsor of a charter school shall establish
405 procedures to conduct administrative hearings upon
406 determination by the sponsor that grounds exist to revoke a
407 charter. Final decisions of a sponsor from hearings
SB 959 24
408 conducted pursuant to this subsection are subject to an
409 appeal to the state board of education, which shall
410 determine whether the charter shall be revoked.
411 (5) A termination shall be effective only at the
412 conclusion of the school year, unless the sponsor determines
413 that continued operation of the school presents a clear and
414 immediate threat to the health and safety of the children.
415 (6) A charter sponsor shall make available the school
416 accountability report card information as provided under
417 section 160.522 and the results of the academic monitoring
418 required under subsection 3 of this section.
419 9. (1) A sponsor shall take all reasonable steps
420 necessary to confirm that each charter school sponsored by
421 such sponsor is in material compliance and remains in
422 material compliance with all material provisions of the
423 charter and sections 160.400 to 160.425 and 167.349. Every
424 charter school shall provide all information necessary to
425 confirm ongoing compliance with all provisions of its
426 charter and sections 160.400 to 160.425 and 167.349 in a
427 timely manner to its sponsor.
428 (2) The sponsor's renewal process of the charter
429 school shall be based on the thorough analysis of a
430 comprehensive body of objective evidence and consider if:
431 (a) The charter school has maintained results on its
432 annual performance report that meet or exceed the district
433 in which the charter school is located based on the
434 performance standards that are applicable to the grade-level
435 configuration of both the charter school and the district in
436 which the charter school is located in three of the last
437 four school years;
SB 959 25
438 (b) The charter school is organizationally and
439 fiscally viable determining at a minimum that the school
440 does not have:
441 a. A negative balance in its operating funds;
442 b. A combined balance of less than three percent of
443 the amount expended for such funds during the previous
444 fiscal year; or
445 c. Expenditures that exceed receipts for the most
446 recently completed fiscal year;
447 (c) The charter is in compliance with its legally
448 binding performance contract and sections 160.400 to 160.425
449 and section 167.349; and
450 (d) The charter school has an annual performance
451 report consistent with a classification of accredited for
452 three of the last four years and is fiscally viable as
453 described in paragraph (b) of this subdivision. If such is
454 the case, the charter school may have an expedited renewal
455 process as defined by rule of the department of elementary
456 and secondary education.
457 (3) (a) Beginning August first during the year in
458 which a charter is considered for renewal, a charter school
459 sponsor shall demonstrate to the state board of education
460 that the charter school is in compliance with federal and
461 state law as provided in sections 160.400 to 160.425 and
462 section 167.349 and the school's performance contract
463 including but not limited to those requirements specific to
464 academic performance.
465 (b) Along with data reflecting the academic
466 performance standards indicated in paragraph (a) of this
467 subdivision, the sponsor shall submit a revised charter
468 application to the state board of education for review.
SB 959 26
469 (c) Using the data requested and the revised charter
470 application under paragraphs (a) and (b) of this
471 subdivision, the state board of education shall determine if
472 compliance with all standards enumerated in this subdivision
473 has been achieved. The state board of education at its next
474 regularly scheduled meeting shall vote on the revised
475 charter application.
476 (d) If a charter school sponsor demonstrates the
477 objectives identified in this subdivision, the state board
478 of education shall renew the school's charter.
479 10. A school district may enter into a lease with a
480 charter school for physical facilities.
481 11. A governing board or a school district employee
482 who has control over personnel actions shall not take
483 unlawful reprisal against another employee at the school
484 district because the employee is directly or indirectly
485 involved in an application to establish a charter school. A
486 governing board or a school district employee shall not take
487 unlawful reprisal against an educational program of the
488 school or the school district because an application to
489 establish a charter school proposes the conversion of all or
490 a portion of the educational program to a charter school.
491 As used in this subsection, "unlawful reprisal" means an
492 action that is taken by a governing board or a school
493 district employee as a direct result of a lawful application
494 to establish a charter school and that is adverse to another
495 employee or an educational program.
496 12. Charter school board members shall be subject to
497 the same liability for acts while in office as if they were
498 regularly and duly elected members of school boards in any
499 other public school district in this state. The governing
500 board of a charter school may participate, to the same
SB 959 27
501 extent as a school board, in the Missouri public entity risk
502 management fund in the manner provided under sections
503 537.700 to 537.756.
504 13. Any entity, either public or private, operating,
505 administering, or otherwise managing a charter school shall
506 be considered a quasi-public governmental body and subject
507 to the provisions of sections 610.010 to 610.035. The
508 provisions of this subsection shall not be construed to
509 authorize a management company to provide any services to a
510 charter school, pursuant to subsection 10 of section 160.400.
511 14. The chief financial officer of a charter school
512 shall maintain:
513 (1) A surety bond in an amount determined by the
514 sponsor to be adequate based on the cash flow of the school;
515 or
516 (2) An insurance policy issued by an insurance company
517 licensed to do business in Missouri on all employees in the
518 amount of five hundred thousand dollars or more that
519 provides coverage in the event of employee theft.
520 15. The department of elementary and secondary
521 education shall calculate an annual performance report for
522 each charter school and shall publish it in the same manner
523 as annual performance reports are calculated and published
524 for districts and attendance centers.
525 16. The joint committee on education shall create a
526 committee to investigate facility access and affordability
527 for charter schools. The committee shall be comprised of
528 equal numbers of the charter school sector and the public
529 school sector and shall report its findings to the general
530 assembly by December 31, 2016.
1 160.410. 1. A charter school shall enroll:
SB 959 28
2 (1) All pupils resident in the district in which it
3 operates;
4 (2) Nonresident pupils eligible to attend a district's
5 school under an urban voluntary transfer program;
6 (3) Nonresident pupils who transfer from an
7 unaccredited district under section 167.895, provided that
8 the charter school is an approved charter school, as defined
9 in section 167.895, and subject to all other provisions of
10 section 167.895;
11 (4) In the case of a charter school whose mission
12 includes student drop-out prevention or recovery, any
13 nonresident pupil from the same or an adjacent county who
14 resides in a residential care facility, a transitional
15 living group home, or an independent living program whose
16 last school of enrollment is in the school district where
17 the charter school is established, who submits a timely
18 application; and
19 (5) In the case of a workplace charter school, any
20 student eligible to attend under subdivision (1) or (2) of
21 this subsection whose parent is employed in the business
22 district, who submits a timely application, unless the
23 number of applications exceeds the capacity of a program,
24 class, grade level or building. The configuration of a
25 business district shall be set forth in the charter and
26 shall not be construed to create an undue advantage for a
27 single employer or small number of employers.
28 2. If capacity is insufficient to enroll all pupils
29 who submit a timely application, the charter school shall
30 have an admissions process that assures all applicants of an
31 equal chance of gaining admission and does not discriminate
32 based on parents' ability to pay fees or tuition except that:
SB 959 29
33 (1) A charter school may establish a geographical area
34 around the school whose residents will receive a preference
35 for enrolling in the school, provided that such preferences
36 do not result in the establishment of racially or
37 socioeconomically isolated schools and provided such
38 preferences conform to policies and guidelines established
39 by the state board of education;
40 (2) A charter school may also give a preference for
41 admission of children whose siblings attend the school or
42 whose parents are employed at the school or in the case of a
43 workplace charter school, a child whose parent is employed
44 in the business district or at the business site of such
45 school;
46 (3) Charter schools may also give a preference for
47 admission to high-risk students, as defined in subdivision
48 (5) of subsection 2 of section 160.405, when the school
49 targets these students through its proposed mission,
50 curriculum, teaching methods, and services;
51 (4) A charter school may also give a preference for
52 admission to students who will be eligible for the free and
53 reduced price lunch program in the upcoming school year.
54 3. A charter school shall not limit admission based on
55 race, ethnicity, national origin, disability, income level,
56 except as allowed under subdivision (4) of subsection 2 of
57 this section, proficiency in the English language or
58 athletic ability, but may limit admission to pupils within a
59 given age group or grade level. Charter schools may limit
60 admission based on gender only when the school is a single-
61 gender school. Students of a charter school who have been
62 enrolled for a full academic year shall be counted in the
63 performance of the charter school on the statewide
64 assessments in that calendar year, unless otherwise exempted
SB 959 30
65 as English language learners. For purposes of this
66 subsection, "full academic year" means the last Wednesday in
67 September through the administration of the Missouri
68 assessment program test without transferring out of the
69 school and re-enrolling.
70 4. A charter school shall make available for public
71 inspection, and provide upon request, to the parent,
72 guardian, or other custodian of any school-age pupil
73 resident in the district in which the school is located the
74 following information:
75 (1) The school's charter;
76 (2) The school's most recent annual report card
77 published according to section 160.522; and
78 (3) The results of background checks on the charter
79 school's board members[; and
80 (4) If a charter school is operated by a management
81 company, a copy of the written contract between the
82 governing board of the charter school and the educational
83 management organization or the charter management
84 organization for services. The charter school may charge
85 reasonable fees, not to exceed the rate specified in section
86 610.026 for furnishing copies of documents under this
87 subsection].
88 5. When a student attending a charter school who is a
89 resident of the school district in which the charter school
90 is located moves out of the boundaries of such school
91 district, the student may complete the current semester and
92 shall be considered a resident student. The student's
93 parent or legal guardian shall be responsible for the
94 student's transportation to and from the charter school.
95 6. If a change in school district boundary lines
96 occurs under section 162.223, 162.431, 162.441, or 162.451,
SB 959 31
97 or by action of the state board of education under section
98 162.081, including attachment of a school district's
99 territory to another district or dissolution, such that a
100 student attending a charter school prior to such change no
101 longer resides in a school district in which the charter
102 school is located, then the student may complete the current
103 academic year at the charter school. The student shall be
104 considered a resident student. The student's parent or
105 legal guardian shall be responsible for the student's
106 transportation to and from the charter school.
107 7. The provisions of sections 167.018 and 167.019
108 concerning foster children's educational rights are
109 applicable to charter schools.
1 160.415. 1. For the purposes of calculation and
2 distribution of state school aid under section 163.031,
3 pupils enrolled in a charter school shall be included in the
4 pupil enrollment of the school district within which each
5 pupil resides. Each charter school shall report the
6 eligibility for free and reduced price lunch, special
7 education, or limited English proficiency status, as well as
8 eligibility for categorical aid, of pupils resident in a
9 school district who are enrolled in the charter school to
10 the school district in which those pupils reside. The
11 charter school shall report the average daily attendance
12 data, free and reduced price lunch count, special education
13 pupil count, and limited English proficiency pupil count to
14 the state department of elementary and secondary education.
15 Each charter school shall promptly notify the state
16 department of elementary and secondary education and the
17 pupil's school district when a pupil discontinues enrollment
18 at a charter school.

23 pupils attending a charter school shall pay to the charter
24 school an annual amount equal to the product of the charter
25 school's weighted average daily attendance and the state
26 adequacy target, multiplied by the dollar value modifier for
27 the district, plus local tax revenues per weighted average
28 daily attendance from the incidental and teachers' funds in
29 excess of the performance levy as defined in section 163.011
30 plus all other state aid attributable to such pupils.
31 (2) The district of residence of a pupil attending a
32 charter school shall also pay to the charter school any
33 other federal or state aid that the district receives on

39 year.

86 pursuant to chapter 536. During the period of dispute, the
