INTRODUCED BY SENATOR BROWN (26).
5787S.01I KRISTINA MARTIN, Secretary
AN ACT
To repeal section 247.220, RSMo, and to enact in lieu thereof one new section relating to public
water supply districts.
Be it enacted by the General Assembly of the State of Missouri, as follows:
1 Section A. Section 247.220, RSMo, is repealed and one new
2 section enacted in lieu thereof, to be known as section 247.220,
3 to read as follows:
1 247.220. 1. Proceedings for the dissolution of a
2 public water supply district shall be substantially the same
3 as proceedings for the formation of such a district, as
4 follows: A petition describing the boundaries of the
5 district sought to be dissolved shall be filed with the
6 clerk of the circuit court of the county wherein the subject
7 district is situate, or with the clerk of the circuit court
8 of the county having the largest acreage within the
9 boundaries of the subject district, in the event that the
10 subject district embraces lands in more than one county.
11 Such petition, in addition to such boundary description,
12 shall allege that further operation of the subject district
13 is inimicable to the best interests of the inhabitants of
14 the district, that the district should, in the interest of
15 the public welfare and safety, be dissolved, that an
16 alternative water supplier is available and better able to
17 supply water to the inhabitants of the district, and such
18 other information as may be useful to the court in
EXPLANATION-Matter enclosed in bold-faced brackets [thus] in this bill is not enacted
and is intended to be omitted in the law.
SB 1460 2
19 determining whether the petition should be granted and a
20 decree of dissolution entered. Such petition shall also
21 include a detailed plan for payment of all debt and
22 obligations of the district at the time of dissolution.
23 Such petition shall be accompanied by a cash deposit of
24 fifty dollars as an advancement of the costs of the
25 proceeding and the petition shall be signed by not less than
26 one-fifth of the registered voters from each subdistrict, or
27 fifty registered voters from each subdistrict, whichever is
28 less, within the subject district. The petition shall be
29 verified by at least one of the signers thereof and shall be
30 served upon the board of directors of the district as
31 provided by law. The district shall be a party, and if the
32 board of directors in its discretion determines that such
33 dissolution is not in the public interest, the district
34 shall oppose such petition and pay all cost and expense
35 thereof.
36 2. Upon the filing of the petition, the same shall be
37 presented to the circuit court, and such court shall fix a
38 date for a hearing on such petition, as provided in this
39 section. Thereupon, the clerk of the court shall give
40 notice of the filing of the petition in some newspaper of
41 general circulation in the county in which the proceedings
42 are pending, and if the district extends into any other
43 county or counties, such notice shall also be published in
44 some newspaper of general circulation in such other county
45 or counties. The notice shall contain a description of the
46 subject boundary lines of the district and the general
47 purposes of the petition, and shall set forth the date fixed
48 for the hearing on the petition, which shall not be less
49 than seven nor more than twenty-one days after the date of
50 the last publication of the notice and shall be on some
SB 1460 3
51 regular judicial day of the court wherein the petition is
52 pending. Such notice shall be signed by the clerk of the
53 circuit court and shall be published in three successive
54 issues of a weekly newspaper or in twenty successive issues
55 of a daily newspaper.
56 3. The court, for good cause shown, may continue the
57 case or the hearing thereon from time to time until final
58 disposition thereof.
59 4. Exceptions to the dissolution of a district may be
60 made by any voter or landowner of the district, and by the
61 district as herein provided; such exceptions shall be filed
62 not less than five days prior to the date set for the
63 hearing on the petition. Such exceptions shall specify the
64 grounds upon which the exceptions are filed and the court
65 shall take them into consideration in passing upon the
66 petition and shall also consider the evidence in support of
67 the petition and in support of the exceptions made. Unless
68 petitioners prove that all debts and financial obligations
69 of the district can be paid in full upon dissolution, the
70 petition shall be dismissed at the cost of the petitioners.
71 5. Should the court find that it would not be to the
72 public interest to dissolve a district, the petition shall
73 be dismissed at the costs of the petitioners. If, however,
74 the court should find in favor of the petitioners, the court
75 shall enter its interlocutory decree of dissolution which
76 decree shall provide for the submission of the question to
77 the voters of the district in substantially the following
78 form:
79 Shall ______ Public Water Supply District be dissolved?
80 6. The decree of dissolution shall not become final
81 and conclusive until it shall have been submitted to the
82 voters residing within the boundaries described in such
SB 1460 4
83 decree and until it shall have been assented to by a
84 majority [of two-thirds] of the voters of the district
85 voting on the proposition. The decree shall provide for the
86 submission of the question and shall fix the date thereof.
87 The returns shall be certified by the election authority to
88 the circuit court having jurisdiction in the case and the
89 court shall thereupon enter its order canvassing the returns
90 and declaring the result of such election.
91 7. If, upon canvass and declaration, it is found and
92 determined that the question shall have been assented to by
93 a majority of two-thirds of the voters of the district
94 voting on such proposition then the court shall, in such
95 order declaring the result of the election, enter a further
96 order declaring the decree of dissolution to be final and
97 conclusive. In the event, however, that the court should
98 find that the question had not been assented to by the
99 majority required, the court shall enter a further order
100 declaring such decree of dissolution to be void and of no
101 effect. No appeal shall lie from any of the aforesaid
102 orders. In the event that the court declares the decree of
103 dissolution to be final, as provided in this section, the
104 clerk of the circuit court shall file certified copies of
105 such decree of dissolution and of such final order with the
106 secretary of state of the state of Missouri, and with the
107 recorder of deeds of the county or counties in which the
108 district is situate and with the clerk of the county
109 commission of the county or counties in which the district
110 is situate.
111 8. Notwithstanding anything in this section to the
112 contrary, no district shall be dissolved until after all of
113 its debts shall have been paid, and the court, in its decree
SB 1460 5
114 of dissolution, shall provide for the disposition of the
115 property of the district.
