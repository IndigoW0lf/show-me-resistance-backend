[208.850. Title.
2 Sections 208.850 to 208.871 shall be known as and may be cited as
3 "The Quality Home Care Act".]
[208.853. Findings and purposes.
2 The people of the state of Missouri find as follows:
3 (1) Thousands of Missouri senior citizens and people with disabilities
4 continue to live independently in their own homes and avoid placement in
5 institutions such as nursing homes only as the result of the availability of
6 qualified personal care attendants who assist them with the activities of daily
7 living.
8 (2) Many Missouri senior citizens and people with disabilities who
9 could not otherwise afford personal care assistance services in their own
10 homes receive the services with assistance provided by the state and federal
11 governments under the Missouri consumer directed services program.
HB 2876 24
12 (3) The United States Supreme Court has mandated that states provide
13 services to persons with disabilities "in community settings rather than in
14 institutions" when remaining in the community is appropriate, consistent with
15 the wishes of the disabled person, and can be reasonably accommodated.
16 (4) In-home care is not only the choice of most senior citizens and
17 people with disabilities, it is less costly than institutional care such as that
18 provided in nursing homes and thus saves Missouri taxpayers significant
19 amounts of money.
20 (5) The consumer directed services program permits the consumers of
21 these highly intimateand personalservices to hire, terminateand supervisethe
22 individual providing the services, but it does not currently give consumers any
23 role in setting wage rates for personal care attendants.
24 (6) Personal care attendants generally receive low wages, minimal or
25 no benefits, little ifany training, and have no meaningfulinput intotheir terms
26 and conditions of employment and no meaningful means of making
27 suggestions for improvements in the consumer directed services program.
28 (7) The continued availability of quality home care services is
29 threatened by a looming shortage of qualified personal care attendants due to
30 the aging population in the state as well as low wages, a lack of benefits, and
31 high rates of occupational injury. These poor working conditions also
32 contribute to high turnover among personal care attendants that impairs the
33 continuity of care.
34 (8) The safety of home care services is threatened by both the failure
35 of existing safeguards to protect consumers from potentially abusive
36 attendants and lengthy delays in processing background checks as recently
37 documented by the state auditor.
38 (9) The continued availability of quality, safe home care services can
39 be ensured through the creation of the "Missouri Quality Home Care Council"
40 with authority to investigate the quality, safety and availability of home care
41 services, recruit eligible personal care attendants, recommend qualifications
42 for personal care attendants, improve the training of personal care attendants,
43 establish a statewide list of eligible personal care attendants, refer consumers
44 to eligible personal care attendants, engage in collective bargaining with a
45 representativeofpersonalcareattendants,andrecommendchangesinpersonal
46 care attendants' wages and benefits to the general assembly.]
