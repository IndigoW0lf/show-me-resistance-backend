2 of agricultural land, section A of this act is deemed
3 necessary for the immediate preservation of the public
4 health, welfare, peace, and safety, and is hereby declared
5 to be an emergency act within the meaning of the
SB 865 10
6 constitution, and section A of this act shall be in full
7 force and effect upon its passage and approval.
