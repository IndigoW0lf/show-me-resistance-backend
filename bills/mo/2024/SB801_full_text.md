116 signed by an employee, agent, or volunteer of a victim
117 service provider, an attorney, or a health care or mental
118 health professional, from whom the victim has sought
119 assistance relating to the domestic violence or abuse. Such
120 documentation shall state that, under penalty of perjury,
121 the employee, agent, or volunteer of a victim service
122 provider, the attorney, or the health care or mental health
123 professional believes the victim has been involved in an
124 incident of domestic violence or abuse.

4 instances where child abuse or neglect has been alleged;
5 (2) Promoting the preservation and reunification of
6 children and families consistent with state and federal law;
7 (3) Providing due process for those accused of child
8 abuse or neglect; and
9 (4) Maintaining an information system operating at all
10 times, capable of receiving and maintaining reports. This
11 information system shall have the ability to receive reports
12 over a single, statewide toll-free number. Such information
13 system shall maintain the results of all investigations,
14 family assessments and services, and other relevant
15 information.
16 2. (1) The division shall utilize structured decision-
17 making protocols, including a standard risk assessment that
18 shall be completed within seventy-two hours of the report of
19 abuse or neglect, for classification purposes of all child
20 abuse and neglect reports. The protocols developed by the
21 division shall give priority to ensuring the well-being and
22 safety of the child. All child abuse and neglect reports
23 shall be initiated within twenty-four hours and shall be
24 classified based upon the reported risk and injury to the
25 child. The division shall promulgate rules regarding the
26 structured decision-making protocols to be utilized for all
27 child abuse and neglect reports.
28 (2) The director of the division and the office of
29 state courts administrator shall develop a joint safety
30 assessment tool before December 31, 2020, and such tool
31 shall be implemented before January 1, 2022. The safety
32 assessment tool shall replace the standard risk assessment
SB 801 8
33 required under subdivision (1) of this subsection and shall
34 also be completed within seventy-two hours of the report of
35 abuse or neglect.
36 3. Upon receipt of a report, the division shall
37 determine if the report merits investigation, including
38 reports which if true would constitute a suspected violation
39 of any of the following: section 565.020, 565.021, 565.023,
40 565.024, or 565.050 if the victim is a child less than
41 eighteen years of age, section 566.030 or 566.060 if the
42 victim is a child less than eighteen years of age, or other
43 crimes under chapter 566 if the victim is a child less than
44 eighteen years of age and the perpetrator is twenty-one
45 years of age or older, section 567.050 if the victim is a
46 child less than eighteen years of age, section 568.020,
47 568.030, 568.045, 568.050, 568.060, 573.200, or 573.205,
48 section 573.025, 573.035, 573.037, or 573.040, or an attempt
49 to commit any such crimes. The division shall immediately
50 communicate all reports that merit investigation to its
51 appropriate local office and any relevant information as may
52 be contained in the information system. The local division
53 staff shall determine, through the use of protocols
54 developed by the division, whether an investigation or the
55 family assessment and services approach should be used to
56 respond to the allegation. The protocols developed by the
57 division shall give priority to ensuring the well-being and
58 safety of the child.
59 4. The division may accept a report for investigation
60 or family assessment if either the child or alleged
61 perpetrator resides in Missouri, may be found in Missouri,
62 or if the incident occurred in Missouri.
63 5. If the division receives a report in which neither
64 the child nor the alleged perpetrator resides in Missouri or
SB 801 9
65 may be found in Missouri and the incident did not occur in
66 Missouri, the division shall document the report and
67 communicate it to the appropriate agency or agencies in the
68 state where the child is believed to be located, along with
69 any relevant information or records as may be contained in
70 the division's information system.
71 6. When the child abuse and neglect hotline receives
72 three or more calls, within a seventy-two hour period, from
73 one or more individuals concerning the same child, the
74 division shall conduct a review to determine whether the
75 calls meet the criteria and statutory definition for a child
76 abuse and neglect report to be accepted. In conducting the
77 review, the division shall contact the hotline caller or
78 callers in order to collect information to determine whether
79 the calls meet the criteria for harassment.
80 7. The local office shall contact the appropriate law
81 enforcement agency immediately upon receipt of a report
82 which division personnel determine merits an investigation
83 and provide such agency with a detailed description of the
84 report received. In such cases the local division office
85 shall request the assistance of the local law enforcement
86 agency in all aspects of the investigation of the
87 complaint. The appropriate law enforcement agency shall
88 either assist the division in the investigation or provide
89 the division, within twenty-four hours, an explanation in
90 writing detailing the reasons why it is unable to assist.
91 8. The local office of the division shall cause an
92 investigation or family assessment and services approach to
93 be initiated in accordance with the protocols established in
94 subsection 2 of this section, except in cases where the sole
95 basis for the report is educational neglect. If the report
96 indicates that educational neglect is the only complaint and
SB 801 10
97 there is no suspicion of other neglect or abuse, the
98 investigation shall be initiated within seventy-two hours of
99 receipt of the report. If the report indicates the child is
100 in danger of serious physical harm or threat to life, an
101 investigation shall include direct observation of the
102 subject child within twenty-four hours of the receipt of the
103 report. Local law enforcement shall take all necessary
104 steps to facilitate such direct observation. Callers to the
105 child abuse and neglect hotline shall be instructed by the
106 division's hotline to call 911 in instances where the child
107 may be in immediate danger. If the parents of the child are
108 not the alleged perpetrators, a parent of the child must be
109 notified prior to the child being interviewed by the
110 division. No person responding to or investigating a child
111 abuse and neglect report shall call prior to a home visit or
112 leave any documentation of any attempted visit, such as
113 business cards, pamphlets, or other similar identifying
114 information if he or she has a reasonable basis to believe
115 the following factors are present:
116 (1) (a) No person is present in the home at the time
117 of the home visit; and
118 (b) The alleged perpetrator resides in the home or the
119 physical safety of the child may be compromised if the
120 alleged perpetrator becomes aware of the attempted visit;
121 (2) The alleged perpetrator will be alerted regarding
122 the attempted visit; or
123 (3) The family has a history of domestic violence or
124 fleeing the community.
125 If the alleged perpetrator is present during a visit by the
126 person responding to or investigating the report, such
127 person shall provide written material to the alleged
SB 801 11
128 perpetrator informing him or her of his or her rights
129 regarding such visit, including but not limited to the right
130 to contact an attorney. The alleged perpetrator shall be
131 given a reasonable amount of time to read such written
132 material or have such material read to him or her by the
133 case worker before the visit commences, but in no event
134 shall such time exceed five minutes; except that, such
135 requirement to provide written material and reasonable time
136 to read such material shall not apply in cases where the
137 child faces an immediate threat or danger, or the person
138 responding to or investigating the report is or feels
139 threatened or in danger of physical harm. If the abuse is
140 alleged to have occurred in a school or child care facility
141 the division shall not meet with the child in any school
142 building or child-care facility building where abuse of such
143 child is alleged to have occurred. When the child is
144 reported absent from the residence, the location and the
145 well-being of the child shall be verified. For purposes of
146 this subsection, "child care facility" shall have the same
147 meaning as such term is defined in section 210.201.
148 9. The director of the division shall name at least
149 one chief investigator for each local division office, who
150 shall direct the division response on any case involving a
151 second or subsequent incident regarding the same subject
152 child or perpetrator. The duties of a chief investigator
153 shall include verification of direct observation of the
154 subject child by the division and shall ensure information
155 regarding the status of an investigation is provided to the
156 public school district liaison. The public school district
157 liaison shall develop protocol in conjunction with the chief
158 investigator to ensure information regarding an
159 investigation is shared with appropriate school personnel.
SB 801 12
160 The superintendent of each school district shall designate a
161 specific person or persons to act as the public school
162 district liaison. Should the subject child attend a
163 nonpublic school the chief investigator shall notify the
164 school principal of the investigation. Upon notification of
165 an investigation, all information received by the public
166 school district liaison or the school shall be subject to
167 the provisions of the federal Family Educational Rights and
168 Privacy Act (FERPA), 20 U.S.C. Section 1232g, and federal
169 rule 34 C.F.R. Part 99.
170 10. The investigation shall include but not be limited
171 to the nature, extent, and cause of the abuse or neglect;
172 the identity and age of the person responsible for the abuse
173 or neglect; the names and conditions of other children in
174 the home, if any; the home environment and the relationship
175 of the subject child to the parents or other persons
176 responsible for the child's care; any indication of
177 incidents of physical violence against any other household
178 or family member; and other pertinent data.
179 11. When a report has been made by a person required
180 to report under section 210.115, the division shall contact
181 the person who made such report within forty-eight hours of
182 the receipt of the report in order to ensure that full
183 information has been received and to obtain any additional
184 information or medical records, or both, that may be
185 pertinent.
186 12. Upon completion of the investigation, if the
187 division suspects that the report was made maliciously or
188 for the purpose of harassment, the division shall refer the
189 report and any evidence of malice or harassment to the local
190 prosecuting or circuit attorney.
SB 801 13
191 13. Multidisciplinary teams shall be used whenever
192 conducting the investigation as determined by the division
193 in conjunction with local law enforcement.
194 Multidisciplinary teams shall be used in providing
195 protective or preventive social services, including the
196 services of law enforcement, a liaison of the local public
197 school, the juvenile officer, the juvenile court, and other
198 agencies, both public and private.
199 14. For all family support team meetings involving an
200 alleged victim of child abuse or neglect, the parents, legal
201 counsel for the parents, foster parents, the legal guardian
202 or custodian of the child, the guardian ad litem or the
203 attorney for the child, and the volunteer advocate for the
204 child shall be provided notice and be permitted to attend
205 all such meetings. Family members, other than alleged
206 perpetrators, or other community informal or formal service
207 providers that provide significant support to the child and
208 other individuals may also be invited at the discretion of
209 the parents of the child. In addition, the parents, the
210 legal counsel for the parents, the legal guardian or
211 custodian and the foster parents may request that other
212 individuals, other than alleged perpetrators, be permitted
213 to attend such team meetings. Once a person is provided
214 notice of or attends such team meetings, the division or the
215 convenor of the meeting shall provide such persons with
216 notice of all such subsequent meetings involving the child.
217 Families may determine whether individuals invited at their
218 discretion shall continue to be invited.
219 15. If the appropriate local division personnel
220 determine after an investigation has begun that completing
221 an investigation is not appropriate, the division shall
222 conduct a family assessment and services approach. The
SB 801 14
223 division shall provide written notification to local law
224 enforcement prior to terminating any investigative process.
225 The reason for the termination of the investigative process
226 shall be documented in the record of the division and the
227 written notification submitted to local law enforcement.
228 Such notification shall not preclude nor prevent any
229 investigation by law enforcement.
230 16. If the appropriate local division personnel
231 determines to use a family assessment and services approach,
232 the division shall:
233 (1) Assess any service needs of the family. The
234 assessment of risk and service needs shall be based on
235 information gathered from the family and other sources;
236 (2) Provide services which are voluntary and time-
237 limited unless it is determined by the division based on the
238 assessment of risk that there will be a high risk of abuse
239 or neglect if the family refuses to accept the services.
240 The division shall identify services for families where it
241 is determined that the child is at high risk of future abuse
242 or neglect. The division shall thoroughly document in the
243 record its attempt to provide voluntary services and the
244 reasons these services are important to reduce the risk of
245 future abuse or neglect to the child. If the family
246 continues to refuse voluntary services or the child needs to
247 be protected, the division may commence an investigation;
248 (3) Commence an immediate investigation if at any time
249 during the family assessment and services approach the
250 division determines that an investigation, as delineated in
251 sections 210.109 to 210.183, is required. The division
252 staff who have conducted the assessment may remain involved
253 in the provision of services to the child and family;
SB 801 15
254 (4) Document at the time the case is closed, the
255 outcome of the family assessment and services approach, any
256 service provided and the removal of risk to the child, if it
257 existed.
258 17. (1) Within forty-five days of an oral report of
259 abuse or neglect, the local office shall update the
260 information in the information system. The information
261 system shall contain, at a minimum, the determination made
262 by the division as a result of the investigation,
263 identifying information on the subjects of the report, those
264 responsible for the care of the subject child and other
265 relevant dispositional information. The division shall
266 complete all investigations within forty-five days, unless
267 good cause for the failure to complete the investigation is
268 specifically documented in the information system. Good
269 cause for failure to complete an investigation shall
270 include, but not be limited to:
271 (a) The necessity to obtain relevant reports of
272 medical providers, medical examiners, psychological testing,
273 law enforcement agencies, forensic testing, and analysis of
274 relevant evidence by third parties which has not been
275 completed and provided to the division;
276 (b) The attorney general or the prosecuting or circuit
277 attorney of the city or county in which a criminal
278 investigation is pending certifies in writing to the
279 division that there is a pending criminal investigation of
280 the incident under investigation by the division and the
281 issuing of a decision by the division will adversely impact
282 the progress of the investigation; or
283 (c) The child victim, the subject of the investigation
284 or another witness with information relevant to the
285 investigation is unable or temporarily unwilling to provide
SB 801 16
286 complete information within the specified time frames due to
287 illness, injury, unavailability, mental capacity, age,
288 developmental disability, or other cause.
289 The division shall document any such reasons for failure to
290 complete the investigation.
291 (2) If a child fatality or near-fatality is involved
292 in a report of abuse or neglect, the investigation shall
293 remain open until the division's investigation surrounding
294 such death or near-fatal injury is completed.
295 (3) If the investigation is not completed within forty-
296 five days, the information system shall be updated at
297 regular intervals and upon the completion of the
298 investigation, which shall be completed no later than ninety
299 days after receipt of a report of abuse or neglect, or one
300 hundred twenty days after receipt of a report of abuse or
301 neglect involving sexual abuse, or until the division's
302 investigation is complete in cases involving a child
303 fatality or near-fatality. The information in the
304 information system shall be updated to reflect any
305 subsequent findings, including any changes to the findings
306 based on an administrative or judicial hearing on the matter.
307 18. A person required to report under section 210.115
308 to the division and any person making a report of child
309 abuse or neglect made to the division which is not made
310 anonymously shall be informed by the division of his or her
311 right to obtain information concerning the disposition of
312 his or her report. Such person shall receive, from the
313 local office, if requested, information on the general
314 disposition of his or her report. Such person may receive,
315 if requested, findings and information concerning the case.
316 Such release of information shall be at the discretion of
SB 801 17
317 the director based upon a review of the reporter's ability
318 to assist in protecting the child or the potential harm to
319 the child or other children within the family. The local
320 office shall respond to the request within forty-five days.
321 The findings shall be made available to the reporter within
322 five days of the outcome of the investigation. If the
323 report is determined to be unsubstantiated, the reporter may
324 request that the report be referred by the division to the
325 office of child advocate for children's protection and
326 services established in sections 37.700 to 37.730. Upon
327 request by a reporter under this subsection, the division
328 shall refer an unsubstantiated report of child abuse or
329 neglect to the office of child advocate for children's
330 protection and services.
331 19. The division shall provide to any individual who
332 is not satisfied with the results of an investigation
333 information about the office of child advocate and the
334 services it may provide under sections 37.700 to 37.730.
335 20. In any judicial proceeding involving the custody
336 of a child the fact that a report may have been made
337 pursuant to sections 210.109 to 210.183 shall not be
338 admissible. However:
339 (1) Nothing in this subsection shall prohibit the
340 introduction of evidence from independent sources to support
341 the allegations that may have caused a report to have been
342 made; and
343 (2) The court may on its own motion, or shall if
344 requested by a party to the proceeding, make an inquiry not
345 on the record with the children's division to determine if
346 such a report has been made.
SB 801 18
347 If a report has been made, the court may stay the custody
348 proceeding until the children's division completes its
349 investigation.
350 21. Nothing in this chapter shall be construed to
351 prohibit the children's division from coinvestigating a
352 report of child abuse or neglect or sharing records and
353 information with child welfare, law enforcement, or judicial
354 officers of another state, territory, or nation if the
355 children's division determines it is appropriate to do so
356 under the standard set forth in subsection 4 of section
357 210.150 and if such receiving agency is exercising its
358 authority under the law.
359 22. In any judicial proceeding involving the custody
360 of a child where the court determines that the child is in
361 need of services under paragraph (d) of subdivision (1) of
362 subsection 1 of section 211.031 and has taken jurisdiction,
363 the child's parent, guardian or custodian shall not be
364 entered into the registry.
365 23. The children's division is hereby granted the
366 authority to promulgate rules and regulations pursuant to
367 the provisions of section 207.021 and chapter 536 to carry
368 out the provisions of sections 210.109 to 210.183.
369 24. Any rule or portion of a rule, as that term is
370 defined in section 536.010, that is created under the
371 authority delegated in this section shall become effective
372 only if it complies with and is subject to all of the
373 provisions of chapter 536 and, if applicable, section
374 536.028. This section and chapter 536 are nonseverable and
375 if any of the powers vested with the general assembly
376 pursuant to chapter 536 to review, to delay the effective
377 date or to disapprove and annul a rule are subsequently held
378 unconstitutional, then the grant of rulemaking authority and
SB 801 19
379 any rule proposed or adopted after August 28, 2000, shall be
380 invalid and void.
1 210.160. 1. In [every case] the following cases
2 involving an abused or neglected child which results in a
3 judicial proceeding, but not including any case in which the
4 court assumes jurisdiction under subdivision (1) of
5 subsection 1 of section 211.031, the judge shall appoint a
6 guardian ad litem to appear for and represent:
7 (1) A child who is the subject of proceedings pursuant
8 to sections [210.110 to 210.165 except proceedings under
9 subsection 6 of section 210.152, sections 210.700 to
10 210.760, sections 211.442 to 211.487,] 210.817 to 210.852 or
11 sections 453.005 to 453.170[,] or proceedings to determine
12 custody or visitation rights under sections 452.375 to
13 452.410; or
14 (2) A parent who is a minor, or who is a mentally ill
15 person or otherwise incompetent, and whose child is the
16 subject of proceedings under sections [210.110 to 210.165,
17 sections 210.700 to 210.760, sections 211.442 to 211.487,]
18 210.817 to 210.852 or sections 453.005 to 453.170.
19 2. [The judge, either sua sponte or upon motion of a
20 party, may appoint a guardian ad litem to appear for and
21 represent an abused or neglected child involved in
22 proceedings arising under subsection 6 of section 210.152.
23 3.] The guardian ad litem shall be provided with all
24 reports relevant to the case made to or by any agency or
25 person, shall have access to all records of such agencies or
26 persons relating to the child or such child's family members
27 or placements of the child, and upon appointment by the
28 court to a case, shall be informed of and have the right to
29 attend any and all family support team meetings involving
30 the child. Employees of the division, officers of the
SB 801 20
31 court, and employees of any agency involved shall fully
32 inform the guardian ad litem of all aspects of the case of
33 which they have knowledge or belief.
34 [4.] 3. The appointing judge shall require the
35 guardian ad litem to faithfully discharge such guardian ad
36 litem's duties, and upon failure to do so shall discharge
37 such guardian ad litem and appoint another. The appointing
38 judge shall have the authority to examine the general and
39 criminal background of persons appointed as guardians ad
40 litem, including utilization of the family care safety
41 registry and access line pursuant to sections 210.900 to
42 210.937, to ensure the safety and welfare of the children
43 such persons are appointed to represent. The judge in
44 making appointments pursuant to this section shall give
45 preference to persons who served as guardian ad litem for
46 the child in the earlier proceeding, unless there is a
47 reason on the record for not giving such preference.
48 [5.] 4. The guardian ad litem may be awarded a
49 reasonable fee for such services to be set by the court.
50 The court, in its discretion, may award such fees as a
51 judgment to be paid by any party to the proceedings or from
52 public funds. However, no fees as a judgment shall be taxed
53 against a party or parties who have not been found to have
54 abused or neglected a child or children. Such an award of
55 guardian fees shall constitute a final judgment in favor of
56 the guardian ad litem. Such final judgment shall be
57 enforceable against the parties in accordance with chapter
58 513.
59 [6.] 5. The court may designate volunteer advocates,
60 who may or may not be attorneys licensed to practice law, to
61 assist in the performance of the guardian ad litem duties
62 for the court. Nonattorney volunteer advocates shall not
SB 801 21
63 provide legal representation. The court shall have the
64 authority to examine the general and criminal background of
65 persons designated as volunteer advocates, including
66 utilization of the family care safety registry and access
67 line pursuant to sections 210.900 to 210.937, to ensure the
68 safety and welfare of the children such persons are
69 designated to represent. The volunteer advocate shall be
70 provided with all reports relevant to the case made to or by
71 any agency or person, shall have access to all records of
72 such agencies or persons relating to the child or such
73 child's family members or placements of the child, and upon
74 designation by the court to a case, shall be informed of and
75 have the right to attend any and all family support team
76 meetings involving the child. Any such designated person
77 shall receive no compensation from public funds. This shall
78 not preclude reimbursement for reasonable expenses.
79 [7.] 6. Any person appointed to perform guardian ad
80 litem duties shall have completed a training program in
81 permanency planning and shall advocate for timely court
82 hearings whenever possible to attain permanency for a child
83 as expeditiously as possible to reduce the effects that
84 prolonged foster care may have on a child. A nonattorney
85 volunteer advocate shall have access to a court appointed
86 attorney guardian ad litem should the circumstances of the
87 particular case so require.
1 210.560. 1. As used in this section, the following
2 terms shall mean:
3 (1) "Child", any child placed in the legal custody of
4 the division under chapter 211;
5 (2) "Division", the children's division of the
6 department of social services of the state of Missouri;
SB 801 22
7 (3) "Money", any legal tender, note, draft,
8 certificate of deposit, stocks, bond or check;
9 (4) "Vested right", a legal right that is more than a
10 mere expectancy and may be reduced to a present monetary
11 value.
12 2. The child, the child's parents, any fiduciary or
13 any representative payee holding or receiving money that are
14 vested rights solely for or on behalf of a child are jointly
15 and severally liable for funds expended by the division to
16 or on behalf of the child. The liability of any person,
17 except a parent of the child, shall be limited to the money
18 received in his or her fiduciary or representative
19 capacity. The Missouri state government shall not require a
20 trustee or a financial institution acting as a trustee to
21 exercise any discretionary powers in the operation of a
22 trust.
23 3. The division may accept an appointment to serve as
24 representative payee or fiduciary, or in a similar capacity
25 for payments to a child under any public or private benefit
26 arrangement. Money so received shall be governed by this
27 section to the extent that laws and regulations governing
28 payment of such benefits provide otherwise.
29 4. Any money received by the division on behalf of a
30 child shall be accounted for in the name of the child. Any
31 money in the account of a child may be expended by the
32 division for care or services for the child. The division
33 shall by rule adopted under chapter 536 establish procedures
34 for the accounting of the money and the protection of the
35 money against theft, loss or misappropriation.
36 5. The division shall deposit money with a financial
37 institution. Any earnings attributable to the money in the
38 account of a child shall be credited to that child's
SB 801 23
39 account. The division shall receive bids from banking
40 corporations, associations or trust companies which desire
41 to be selected as depositories of children's moneys for the
42 division.
43 6. The division may accept funds which a parent,
44 guardian or other person wishes to provide for the use or
45 benefit of the child. The use and deposit of such funds
46 shall be governed by this section and any additional
47 directions given by the provider of the funds.
48 7. Each child for whose benefit funds have been
49 received by the division and the [guardian ad litem]
50 attorney of such child shall be furnished annually with a
51 statement listing all transactions involving the funds which
52 have been deposited on the child's behalf, to include each
53 receipt and disbursement.
54 8. The division shall use all proper diligence to
55 dispose of the balance of money accumulated in the child's
56 account when the child is released from the care and custody
57 of the division or the child dies. When the child is
58 deceased the balance shall be disposed of as provided by law
59 for descent and distribution. If, after the division has
60 diligently used such methods and means as considered
61 reasonable to refund such funds, there shall remain any
62 money, the owner of which is unknown to the division, or if
63 known, cannot be located by the division, in each and every
64 such instance such money shall escheat and vest in the state
65 of Missouri, and the director and officials of the division
66 shall pay the same to the state director of the department
67 of revenue, taking a receipt therefor, who shall deposit the
68 money in the state treasury to be credited to a fund to be
69 designated as "escheat".
SB 801 24
70 9. Within five years after money has been paid into
71 the state treasury, any person who appears and claims the
72 money may file a petition in the circuit court of Cole
73 County, Missouri, stating the nature of the claim and
74 praying that such money be paid to him. A copy of the
75 petition shall be served upon the director of the department
76 of revenue who shall file an answer to the same. The court
77 shall proceed to examine the claim and the allegations and
78 proof, and if it finds that such person is entitled to any
79 money so paid into the state treasury, it shall order the
80 commissioner of administration to issue a warrant on the
81 state treasurer for the amount of such claim, but without
82 interest or costs. A certified copy of the order shall be
83 sufficient voucher for issuing a warrant; provided, that
84 either party may appeal from the decision of the court in
85 the same manner as provided by law in other civil actions.
86 10. All moneys paid into the state treasury under the
87 provisions of this section after remaining there unclaimed
88 for five years shall escheat and vest absolutely in the
89 state and be credited to the state treasury, and all persons
90 shall be forever barred and precluded from setting up title
91 or claim to any such funds.
92 11. Nothing in this section shall be deemed to apply
93 to funds regularly due the state of Missouri for the support
94 and maintenance of children in the care and custody of the
95 division or collected by the state of Missouri as
96 reimbursement for state funds expended on behalf of the
97 child.
1 210.565. 1. Whenever a child is placed in a foster
2 home and the court has determined pursuant to subsection 4
3 of this section that foster home placement with relatives is
4 not contrary to the best interest of the child, the
SB 801 25
5 children's division shall give foster home placement to
6 relatives of the child. Notwithstanding any rule of the
7 division to the contrary and under section 210.305, the
8 children's division shall complete a diligent search to
9 locate and notify the grandparents, adult siblings, parents
10 of siblings of the child, and all other relatives and
11 determine whether they wish to be considered for placement
12 of the child. Grandparents who request consideration shall
13 be given preference and first consideration for foster home
14 placement of the child. If more than one grandparent
15 requests consideration, the family support team shall make
16 recommendations to the juvenile or family court about which
17 grandparent should be considered for placement.
18 2. As used in this section, the following terms shall
19 mean:
20 (1) "Adult sibling", any brother or sister of whole or
21 half-blood who is at least eighteen years of age;
22 (2) "Relative", a grandparent or any other person
23 related to another by blood or affinity or a person who is
24 not so related to the child but has a close relationship
25 with the child or the child's family. A foster parent or
26 kinship caregiver with whom a child has resided for nine
27 months or more is a person who has a close relationship with
28 the child. The status of a grandparent shall not be
29 affected by the death or the dissolution of the marriage of
30 a son or daughter;
31 (3) "Sibling", one of two or more individuals who have
32 one or both parents in common through blood, marriage, or
33 adoption, including siblings as defined by the child's
34 tribal code or custom.
35 3. The following shall be the order or preference for
36 placement of a child under this section:
SB 801 26
37 (1) Grandparents;
38 (2) Adult siblings or parents of siblings;
39 (3) Relatives; and
40 (4) Any foster parent who is currently licensed and
41 capable of accepting placement of the child.
42 4. The preference for placement and first
43 consideration for grandparents or preference for placement
44 with other relatives created by this section shall only
45 apply where the court finds that placement with such
46 grandparents or other relatives is not contrary to the best
47 interest of the child considering all circumstances. If the
48 court finds that it is contrary to the best interest of a
49 child to be placed with grandparents or other relatives, the
50 court shall make specific findings on the record detailing
51 the reasons why the best interests of the child necessitate
52 placement of the child with persons other than grandparents
53 or other relatives. Absent evidence to the contrary, the
54 court may presume that continuation of the child's placement
55 with his or her current caregivers is in the child's best
56 interests.
57 5. Recognizing the critical nature of sibling bonds
58 for children, the children's division shall make reasonable
59 efforts to place siblings in the same foster care, kinship,
60 guardianship, or adoptive placement, unless doing so would
61 be contrary to the safety or well-being of any of the
62 siblings. If siblings are not placed together, the
63 children's division shall make reasonable efforts to provide
64 frequent visitation or other ongoing interaction between the
65 siblings, unless this interaction would be contrary to a
66 sibling's safety or well-being.
67 6. The age of the child's grandparent or other
68 relative shall not be the only factor that the children's
SB 801 27
69 division takes into consideration when it makes placement
70 decisions and recommendations to the court about placing the
71 child with such grandparent or other relative.
72 7. For any Native American child placed in protective
73 custody, the children's division shall comply with the
74 placement requirements set forth in 25 U.S.C. Section 1915.
75 8. A grandparent or other relative may, on a case-by-
76 case basis, have standards for licensure not related to
77 safety waived for specific children in care that would
78 otherwise impede licensing of the grandparent's or
79 relative's home. In addition, any person receiving a
80 preference may be licensed in an expedited manner if a child
81 is placed under such person's care.
82 9. The [guardian ad litem] child's attorney shall
83 ascertain the child's wishes and feelings about his or her
84 placement by conducting an interview or interviews with the
85 child, if appropriate based on the child's age and maturity
86 level, which shall be considered as a factor in placement
87 decisions and recommendations, but shall not supersede the
88 preference for relative placement created by this section or
89 be contrary to the child's best interests.
1 210.762. 1. When a child is taken into custody by a
2 juvenile officer or law enforcement official under
3 subdivision (1) of subsection 1 of section 211.031 and
4 initially placed with the division, the division may make a
5 temporary placement and shall arrange for a family support
6 team meeting prior to or within twenty-four hours following
7 the protective custody hearing held under section 211.032.
8 After a child is in the division's custody and a temporary
9 placement has been made, the division shall arrange an
10 additional family support team meeting prior to taking any
11 action relating to the placement of such child; except that,
SB 801 28
12 when the welfare of a child in the custody of the division
13 requires an immediate or emergency change of placement, the
14 division may make a temporary placement and shall schedule a
15 family support team meeting within seventy-two hours. The
16 requirement for a family support team meeting shall not
17 apply when the parent has consented in writing to the
18 termination of his or her parental rights in conjunction
19 with a placement in a licensed child-placing agency under
20 subsection 6 of section 453.010.
21 2. The parents, the legal counsel for the parents, the
22 foster parents, the legal guardian or custodian of the
23 child, the guardian ad litem or the attorney for the child,
24 and the volunteer advocate, and any designee of the parent
25 that has written authorization shall be notified and invited
26 to participate in all family support team meetings. The
27 family support team meeting may include such other persons
28 whose attendance at the meeting may assist the team in
29 making appropriate decisions in the best interests of the
30 child. If the division finds that it is not in the best
31 interest of a child to be placed with relatives, the
32 division shall make specific findings in the division's
33 report detailing the reasons why the best interests of the
34 child necessitate placement of the child with persons other
35 than relatives.
36 3. The division shall use the form created in
37 subsection 2 of section 210.147 to be signed upon the
38 conclusion of the meeting pursuant to subsection 1 of this
39 section confirming that all involved parties are aware of
40 the team's decision regarding the custody and placement of
41 the child. Any dissenting views must be recorded and
42 attested to on such form.
SB 801 29
43 4. The case manager shall be responsible for including
44 such form with the case records of the child.
1 210.795. 1. (1) A child in the care and custody of
2 the children's division whose physical whereabouts are
3 unknown to the division, the child's physical custodian, or
4 contracted service providers shall be considered missing and
5 the case manager or placement provider shall immediately
6 inform a law enforcement agency having jurisdiction and the
7 National Center for Missing and Exploited Children within
8 two hours of discovery that the child is missing.
9 (2) The case manager shall document the report number
10 and any relevant information in the child's record.
11 (3) Within twenty-four hours of a report being made
12 under this subsection, the department shall inform and
13 obtain information about the child's disappearance from the
14 child's parents, known relatives, out-of-home caregivers,
15 attorney, guardian [or guardian ad litem], court-appointed
16 special advocate, juvenile officer, or Indian tribe, as
17 applicable, or from any other person known to the department
18 who may have relevant information regarding the child's
19 disappearance.
20 (4) The case manager shall:
21 (a) Within one week and monthly thereafter, maintain
22 contact with the child's family members, friends, school
23 faculty, and service providers and with any other person or
24 agency involved in the child's case;
25 (b) Document ongoing efforts to locate the child; and
26 (c) Continue contacting law enforcement about the
27 missing child and shall make quarterly reports to the court
28 about the status of the child and efforts to locate the
29 child.
SB 801 30
30 The department shall contact law enforcement every seven
31 days and document the information provided and any
32 information received.
33 (5) The division shall not petition the court for a
34 release of jurisdiction for the child or stop searching for
35 the child while the child is missing until the child reaches
36 the age of twenty-one.
37 2. The division shall maintain protocols, including
38 appropriate trainings, for conducting ongoing searches for
39 children missing from care. Such protocols shall include
40 preventative measures to identify and mitigate risk to
41 children who are at increased risk for running away or
42 disappearing or of being victims of trafficking as defined
43 under section 566.200.
44 3. The division shall ensure that each child in the
45 care and custody of the division has an updated photograph
46 in the child's record.
47 4. When a child is located, the department shall:
48 (1) Inform all law enforcement agencies and
49 organizations involved in the child's case; and
50 (2) Have in-person contact with the child within
51 twenty-four hours after the child is located to assess the
52 child's health, experiences while absent, the
53 appropriateness of the child returning to the child's
54 current placement, and the factors that contributed to the
55 child's absence.
56 5. Any employee or contractor with the children's
57 division, child welfare agencies, other state agencies, or
58 schools shall, upon becoming aware that an emancipated minor
59 as defined in section 302.178, a homeless youth as defined
60 in section 167.020, or an unaccompanied minor as defined in
61 section 210.121 is missing, inform the appropriate law
SB 801 31
62 enforcement agency and the National Center for Missing and
63 Exploited Children within twenty-four hours.
64 6. Within twenty-four hours of a missing child being
65 found, the division shall assess whether the child was a
66 victim of trafficking and determine any factors that caused
67 the child to go missing.
68 7. The general assembly may require an annual
69 independent audit of the department's compliance with this
70 section.

44 there is a reason on the record for not giving such
45 preference.
46 (3) Any person appointed to serve as a child's counsel
47 under this subsection shall have completed a training
48 program in permanency planning and shall advocate for timely

73 stability; and the complexity of the proceedings.

79 counsel; and
80 (3) That a full and fair hearing requires appointment
81 of counsel for the custodian.
82 [5.] 6. Counsel shall be allowed a reasonable time in
83 which to prepare to represent his client.
84 [6.] 7. Counsel shall serve for all stages of the

88 disposition.
89 [7.] 8. The child and his custodian may be represented
90 by the same counsel except where a conflict of interest
91 exists, except as otherwise provided in subdivision (1) of
92 subsection 2 of this section. Where it appears to the court
93 that a conflict exists, it shall order that the child and
94 his custodian be represented by separate counsel, and it
95 shall appoint counsel if required by subsection [3 or 4] 4
96 or 5 of this section.
97 [8.] 9. When a petition has been filed, a child may
98 waive his or her right to counsel only with the approval of
SB 801 37
99 the court and if such waiver is not prohibited under
100 subsection [10] 11 of this section. If a child waives his
101 or her right to counsel for any proceeding except
102 proceedings under subsection [10] 11 of this section, the
103 waiver shall only apply to that proceeding. In any
104 subsequent proceeding, the child shall be informed of his or
105 her right to counsel.
106 [9.] 10. Waiver of counsel by a child may be withdrawn
