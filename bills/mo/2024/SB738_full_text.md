46 employment with the department. For purposes of this
47 subsection, "affiliated in any manner" includes owning the

50 director of the department of revenue may promulgate rules
51 and regulations necessary to carry out the provisions of
52 this subsection. Any rule or portion of a rule, as that
53 term is defined in section 536.010, that is created under
54 the authority delegated in this subsection shall become

56 the provisions of chapter 536 and, if applicable, section
57 536.028. This section and chapter 536 are nonseverable and
58 if any of the powers vested with the general assembly
59 pursuant to chapter 536 to review, to delay the effective
60 date, or to disapprove and annul a rule are subsequently
61 held unconstitutional, then the grant of rulemaking

88 7. Notwithstanding any other provision of law to the
89 contrary, the state auditor may audit all records maintained
90 and established by the fee office in the same manner as the

92 department shall ensure that this audit requirement is a
93 necessary condition for the award of all fee office
94 contracts. No confidential records shall be divulged in
95 such a way to reveal personally identifiable information.

108 Section 30(b) of the Missouri Constitution, the provisions
109 of this subsection shall be null and void.

136 shall be distributed to the entity holding each fee office
137 contract when the quarterly disbursement occurs, provided
138 that in the case that a contract fee office transitions
139 between two contractors during the quarter, the disbursement
140 for that fee office shall be divided between the contractors
141 in proportion to the number of transactions the office
142 processed under each contractor during the quarter for which
143 the transfer is taking place.
