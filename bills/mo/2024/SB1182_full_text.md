33 enrollee in excess of thirty dollars per thirty day supply
34 of a prescription insulin drug.
35 3. (1) An enrollee's cost-sharing for prescription
36 insulin drugs shall be calculated at the point of sale based

38 least one hundred percent of all rebates received, or to be
39 received, in connection with the dispensing or
40 administration of the drug.
41 (2) Nothing in this subsection shall prohibit a

52 receives on a product, manufacturer, or pharmacy-specific
53 basis. Such information shall be protected as a trade
54 secret, shall not be a public record under chapter 610, and

60 rebate information.
61 4. If any provision of this section or the application
62 thereof to anyone or to any circumstance is held invalid,
63 the remainder of this section and the application of such
64 provisions to others or other circumstances shall not be
65 affected thereby.
