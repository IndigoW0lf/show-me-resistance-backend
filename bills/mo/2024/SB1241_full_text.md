33 fixed by appraisement by the director.
34 4. The director of the department of revenue shall
35 endorse upon the official certificate of title issued by the
36 director upon such application an entry showing that such

67 hundred thousand dollars, on a form approved by the
68 department. The bond or irrevocable letter of credit shall
69 be conditioned upon the registered fleet owner complying
70 with the provisions of any statutes applicable to registered
71 fleet owners, and the bond shall be an indemnity for any
72 loss sustained by reason of the acts of the person bonded
73 when such acts constitute grounds for the suspension or
74 revocation of the registered fleet owner license. The bond
75 shall be executed in the name of the state of Missouri for
76 the benefit of all aggrieved parties or the irrevocable
77 letter of credit shall name the state of Missouri as the
78 beneficiary; except that, the aggregate liability of the
79 surety or financial institution to the aggrieved parties

103 occurs within a corporation which holds a license to operate
104 as a motor vehicle or boat dealer pursuant to sections
105 301.550 to 301.573 the provisions in subdivision (3) of this
106 subsection shall not apply.
107 8. If the owner of any motor vehicle, trailer, boat,
108 or outboard motor desires to charge and collect sales tax as
109 provided in this section, the owner shall make application
110 to the director of revenue for a permit to operate as a
111 motor vehicle, trailer, boat, or outboard motor leasing
112 company. The director of revenue shall promulgate rules and
113 regulations determining the qualifications of such a
114 company, and the method of collection and reporting of sales
SB 1241 5
115 tax charged and collected. Such regulations shall apply

122 under sections 144.010, 144.020, 144.070 and 144.440 unless
123 all motor vehicles, trailers, boats, and outboard motors
124 held for renting and leasing are included.
125 9. Any person, company, or corporation engaged in the
126 business of renting or leasing three thousand five hundred
127 or more motor vehicles which are to be used exclusively for

130 as a leasing company may also operate as a registered fleet
131 owner as prescribed in section 301.032.
132 10. Beginning July 1, 2010, any motor vehicle dealer
133 licensed under section 301.560 engaged in the business of
134 selling motor vehicles or trailers shall apply to the
135 director of revenue for authority to collect and remit the
136 sales tax required under this section on all motor vehicles
137 sold by the motor vehicle dealer. A motor vehicle dealer
138 receiving authority to collect and remit the tax is subject
139 to all provisions under sections 144.010 to 144.525. Any
140 motor vehicle dealer authorized to collect and remit sales
141 taxes on motor vehicles under this subsection shall be
142 entitled to deduct and retain an amount equal to two percent
143 of the motor vehicle sales tax pursuant to section 144.140.
144 Any amount of the tax collected under this subsection that
145 is retained by a motor vehicle dealer pursuant to section
146 144.140 shall not constitute state revenue. In no event
SB 1241 6
147 shall revenues from the general revenue fund or any other
148 state fund be utilized to compensate motor vehicle dealers
149 for their role in collecting and remitting sales taxes on
150 motor vehicles. In the event this subsection or any portion
151 thereof is held to violate Article IV, Section 30(b) of the
152 Missouri Constitution, no motor vehicle dealer shall be
153 authorized to collect and remit sales taxes on motor
154 vehicles under this section. No motor vehicle dealer shall
155 seek compensation from the state of Missouri or its agencies
156 if a court of competent jurisdiction declares that the
157 retention of two percent of the motor vehicle sales tax is
158 unconstitutional and orders the return of such revenues.

160 terms mean:

206 proof of income, proof of purchase, identification
207 documents, or other documents. The department is encouraged
208 to make the process user-friendly and not overly burdensome
209 on the qualified purchaser.
SB 1241 8
210 (4) The qualified purchaser shall apply for a payment
211 plan on or before September 30, 2025. Any established

244 established with the department before the qualified amount
245 has been paid in full, the payment plan shall be
246 terminated. The qualified purchaser shall be given full
247 credit of all prior payments towards the qualified amount.

254 (9) The department of revenue may promulgate all
255 necessary rules and regulations for the administration of
256 this subsection. Any rule or portion of a rule, as that
257 term is defined in section 536.010, that is created under

262 and if any of the powers vested with the general assembly
263 pursuant to chapter 536 to review, to delay the effective

297 term is defined in section 536.010, that is created under
298 the authority delegated in this subsection shall become

302 and if any of the powers vested with the general assembly
303 pursuant to chapter 536 to review, to delay the effective
304 date, or to disapprove and annul a rule are subsequently
SB 1241 11
305 held unconstitutional, then the grant of rulemaking
306 authority and any rule proposed or adopted after August 28,

8 whether in use or not, unless such possession is solely for
9 charitable purposes; except that the buyer of a motor
10 vehicle or trailer who trades in a motor vehicle or trailer
11 may attach the license plates from the traded-in motor
12 vehicle or trailer to the newly purchased motor vehicle or
13 trailer. The operation of a motor vehicle with such

15 days, or no more than ninety days if the dealer is selling
16 the motor vehicle under the provisions of section 301.213,
17 or no more than sixty days if the dealer is selling the

SB 1241 12
30 such motor vehicle is of greater horsepower, gross weight or
31 (in the case of a passenger-carrying commercial motor
32 vehicle) seating capacity, for which a greater fee is
33 prescribed, the applicant shall pay a transfer fee of two
34 dollars and a pro rata portion for the difference in fees.
35 When such vehicle is of less horsepower, gross weight or (in
36 case of a passenger-carrying commercial motor vehicle)
37 seating capacity, for which a lesser fee is prescribed, the

46 will no longer be operated. When the newly purchased motor
47 vehicle is of greater horsepower, gross weight or (in the
48 case of a passenger-carrying commercial motor vehicle)

50 applicant shall pay a transfer fee of two dollars and a pro
51 rata portion of the difference in fees. When the newly
52 purchased vehicle is of less horsepower, gross weight or (in
53 the case of a passenger-carrying commercial motor vehicle)
54 seating capacity, for which a lesser fee is prescribed, the
55 applicant shall not be entitled to a refund.

61 issued by a dealer selling the motor vehicle under the
SB 1241 13
62 provisions of section 301.213, or no more than sixty days if
63 issued by a dealer selling the motor vehicle under the
64 provisions of subsection 5 of section 301.210, from the date
65 of purchase. The temporary permit authorized under this
66 section may be purchased by the purchaser of a motor vehicle
67 or trailer from the central office of the department of
68 revenue or from an authorized agent of the department of
69 revenue upon proof of purchase of a motor vehicle or trailer

82 a motor vehicle dealer, an authorized agent of the
83 department of revenue or the department of revenue for a
84 temporary permit shall not exceed five dollars for each
85 permit. The director of the department of revenue shall
86 direct motor vehicle dealers and authorized agents to obtain
87 temporary permits from an authorized producer. Amounts
88 received by the director of the department of revenue for
89 temporary permits shall constitute state revenue; however,

92 state revenue and any amounts received by motor vehicle
93 dealers or authorized agents for temporary permits purchased
SB 1241 14
94 from a producer other than the director of the department of
95 revenue shall not constitute state revenue. In no event

97 state fund be utilized to compensate motor vehicle dealers
98 or other producers for their role in producing temporary
99 permits as authorized under this section. Amounts that do
100 not constitute state revenue under this section shall also
101 not constitute fees for registration or certificates of
102 title to be collected by the director of the department of
103 revenue under section 301.190. No motor vehicle dealer,
104 authorized agent or the department of revenue shall charge
105 more than five dollars for each permit issued. The permit
106 shall be valid for a period of thirty days, or no more than
107 ninety days if issued by a dealer selling the motor vehicle
108 under the provisions of section 301.213, or no more than
109 sixty days if issued by a dealer selling the motor vehicle

113 motor vehicle dealer for which the purchaser obtains a
114 permit as set out above. No permit shall be issued for a
115 vehicle under this section unless the buyer shows proof of
116 financial responsibility. Each temporary permit issued
117 shall be securely fastened to the back or rear of the motor
118 vehicle in a manner and place on the motor vehicle
119 consistent with registration plates so that all parts and
120 qualities of the temporary permit thereof shall be plainly
121 and clearly visible, reasonably clean and are not impaired
122 in any way.
123 5. The permit shall be issued on a form prescribed by
124 the director of the department of revenue and issued only
125 for the applicant's temporary operation of the motor vehicle

127 operate the motor vehicle while proper title and
128 registration plates are being obtained, or while awaiting
129 receipt of registration plates, and shall be displayed on no
130 other motor vehicle. Temporary permits issued pursuant to
131 this section shall not be transferable or renewable, shall
132 not be valid upon issuance of proper registration plates for
133 the motor vehicle or trailer, and shall be returned to the
134 department or to the department's agent upon the issuance of
135 such proper registration plates. Any temporary permit
136 returned to the department or to the department's agent
137 shall be immediately destroyed. The provisions of this
138 subsection shall not apply to temporary permits issued for

140 thousand pounds gross weight. The director of the
141 department of revenue shall determine the size, material,
142 design, numbering configuration, construction, and color of
143 the permit. The director of the department of revenue, at
144 his or her discretion, shall have the authority to reissue,
145 and thereby extend the use of, a temporary permit previously
146 and legally issued for a motor vehicle or trailer while
147 proper title and registration are being obtained.
148 6. Every motor vehicle dealer that issues temporary
149 permits shall keep, for inspection by proper officers, an
150 accurate record of each permit issued by recording the
151 permit number, the motor vehicle dealer's number, buyer's
152 name and address, the motor vehicle's year, make, and
153 manufacturer's vehicle identification number, and the
154 permit's date of issuance and expiration date. Upon the
155 issuance of a temporary permit by either the central office

161 Missouri.
162 7. Upon the transfer of ownership of any currently
163 registered motor vehicle wherein the owner cannot transfer
164 the license plates due to a change of motor vehicle
165 category, the owner may surrender the license plates issued
166 to the motor vehicle and receive credit for any unused
167 portion of the original registration fee against the
168 registration fee of another motor vehicle. Such credit
169 shall be granted based upon the date the license plates are
170 surrendered. No refunds shall be made on the unused portion
171 of any license plates surrendered for such credit.
172 8. An additional temporary license plate produced in a
173 manner and of materials determined by the director to be the
174 most cost-effective means of production with a configuration
175 that matches an existing or newly issued plate may be
176 purchased by a motor vehicle owner to be placed in the
177 interior of the vehicle's rear window such that the driver's
178 view out of the rear window is not obstructed and the plate
179 configuration is clearly visible from the outside of the
180 vehicle to serve as the visible plate when a bicycle rack or
181 other item obstructs the view of the actual plate. Such
182 temporary plate is only authorized for use when the matching
183 actual plate is affixed to the vehicle in the manner
184 prescribed in subsection 5 of section 301.130. The fee
185 charged for the temporary plate shall be equal to the fee
186 charged for a temporary permit issued under subsection 4 of
187 this section. Replacement temporary plates authorized in
188 this subsection may be issued as needed upon the payment of
189 a fee equal to the fee charged for a temporary permit under
SB 1241 17
190 subsection 4 of this section. The newly produced third
191 plate may only be used on the vehicle with the matching
192 plate, and the additional plate shall be clearly
193 recognizable as a third plate and only used for the purpose
194 specified in this subsection.
195 9. Notwithstanding the provisions of section 301.217,
196 the director may issue a temporary permit to an individual
197 who possesses a salvage motor vehicle which requires an
198 inspection under subsection 9 of section 301.190. The
199 operation of a salvage motor vehicle for which the permit
200 has been issued shall be limited to the most direct route
201 from the residence, maintenance, or storage facility of the
202 individual in possession of such motor vehicle to the
203 nearest authorized inspection facility and return to the
204 originating location. Notwithstanding any other
205 requirements for the issuance of a temporary permit under
206 this section, an individual obtaining a temporary permit for
207 the purpose of operating a motor vehicle to and from an
208 examination facility as prescribed in this subsection shall
209 also purchase the required motor vehicle examination form
210 which is required to be completed for an examination under
211 subsection 9 of section 301.190 and provide satisfactory
212 evidence that such vehicle has passed a motor vehicle safety
213 inspection for such vehicle as required in section 307.350.
214 10. Beginning October 1, 2024, and ending December 31,
215 2025, notwithstanding any other provision of law to the
216 contrary, the director may issue a temporary permit to an
217 individual who establishes a payment plan with the
218 department of revenue under section 144.070, subject to the
219 sunset provisions under subsection 11 of section 144.070.
220 11. The director of the department of revenue may
221 promulgate all necessary rules and regulations for the
SB 1241 18
222 administration of this section. Any rule or portion of a
223 rule, as that term is defined in section 536.010, that is
224 created under the authority delegated in this section shall
225 become effective only if it complies with and is subject to
226 all of the provisions of chapter 536 and, if applicable,
227 section 536.028. This section and chapter 536 are
228 nonseverable and if any of the powers vested with the
229 general assembly pursuant to chapter 536 to review, to delay
230 the effective date, or to disapprove and annul a rule are
231 subsequently held unconstitutional, then the grant of
232 rulemaking authority and any rule proposed or adopted after
233 August 28, 2012, shall be invalid and void.
234 [11.] 12. The repeal and reenactment of this section
235 shall become effective on the date the department of revenue
236 or a producer authorized by the director of the department
237 of revenue begins producing temporary permits described in
238 subsection 4 of such section, or on July 1, 2013, whichever
239 occurs first. If the director of revenue or a producer
240 authorized by the director of the department of revenue
241 begins producing temporary permits prior to July 1, 2013,
242 the director of the department of revenue shall notify the
243 revisor of statutes of such fact.
