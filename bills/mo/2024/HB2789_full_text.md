24 The presumption may be rebutted if the court finds that the parents have reached an
25 agreement on all issues related to custody, or if the court finds that a pattern of domestic
26 violence has occurred as set out in subdivision (6) of this subsection. When the parties have
27 not reached an agreement on all issues related to custody, the court shall consider all relevant
28 factors and enter written findings offact and conclusions of law, including, but not limited to,

73 frequent, continuing and meaningful contact with both parents after the parents have
74 separatedordissolvedtheirmarriageisinthebestinterestofthechild,exceptforcaseswhere
75 the court specifically finds that such contact is not in the best interest of the child, and that it
76 is the public policy of this state to encourage parents to participate in decisions affecting the
77 health, education and welfare of their children, and to resolve disputes involving their
78 childrenamicably through alternative dispute resolution. Inorder to effectuate these policies,
79 the general assembly encourages the court to enter a temporary parenting plan as early as
80 practicable in a proceeding under this chapter, consistent with the provisions of subsection 2
81 ofthis section,and, in sodoing,the courtshall determine thecustody arrangementwhich will
82 best assure both parents participate in such decisions and have frequent, continuing and
83 meaningful contact with their children so long as it is in the best interests of the child.
84 5. Prior to awarding the appropriate custody arrangement in the best interest of the
85 child, the court shall consider each of the following as follows:
86 (1) Joint physical and joint legal custody to both parents, which shall not be denied
87 solely for the reason that one parent opposes a joint physical and joint legal custody award.
88 The residence of one of the parents shall be designated as the address of the child for mailing
89 and educational purposes;
HB 2789 4
90 (2) Jointphysicalcustodywithonepartygrantedsolelegalcustody. Theresidenceof
91 one of the parents shall be designated as the address of the child for mailing and educational
92 purposes;
93 (3) Joint legal custody with one party granted sole physical custody;
94 (4) Sole custody to either parent; or
95 (5) Third-party custody or visitation:
96 (a) When the court finds that each parent is unfit, unsuitable, or unable to be a
97 custodian, or the welfare of the child requires, and it is in the best interests of the child, then
98 custody,temporarycustodyorvisitationmaybeawardedtoapersonrelatedbyconsanguinity
99 oraffinity to the child. If no person related to the child by consanguinity or affinity iswilling
100 to accept custody, then the court may award custody to any other person or persons deemed
101 by the court to be suitable and able to provide an adequate and stable environment for the
102 child. Before the court awards custody, temporary custody or visitation to a third person
103 under this subdivision, the court shall make that person a party to the action;
104 (b) Under the provisions of this subsection, any person may petition the court to
105 intervene as a party in interest at any time as provided by supreme court rule.
106 6. If the parties have not agreed to a custodial arrangement, or the court determines
107 such arrangement is not in the best interest of the child, the court shall include a written
108 finding in the judgment or order based on the public policy in subsection 4 of this section and
109 each of the factors listed in subdivisions (1) to (8) of subsection 2 of this section detailing the
110 specificrelevant factorsthat madeaparticulararrangement inthebest interestofthechild. If
111 a proposed custodial arrangement is rejected by the court, the court shall include a written
112 finding in the judgment or order detailing the specific relevant factors resulting in the
113 rejection of such arrangement.
114 7. Upon a finding by the court that either parent has refused to exchange information
115 with the other parent, which shall include but not be limited to information concerning the
116 health, education and welfare of the child, the court shall order the parent to comply
117 immediately and to pay the prevailing party a sum equal to the prevailing party's cost
118 associated with obtaining the requested information, which shall include but not be limited to
119 reasonable attorney's fees and court costs.
120 8. As between the parents of a child, no preference may be given to either parent in
121 the awarding of custody because of that parent's age, sex, or financial status, nor because of
122 the age or sex of the child. The court shall not presume that a parent, solely because of his or
123 her sex, is more qualified than the other parent to act as a joint or sole legal or physical
124 custodian for the child.
125 9. Any judgment providing for custody shall include a specific written parenting plan
126 setting forth the terms of such parenting plan arrangements specified in subsection 8 of
HB 2789 5
127 section 452.310. Such plan may be a parenting plan submitted by the parties pursuant to
128 section 452.310 or, in the absence thereof, a plandetermined by the court, but in all cases,the
129 custody plan approved and ordered by the court shall be in the court's discretion and shall be
130 in the best interest of the child.
131 10. After August 28, 2016, every court order establishing or modifying custody or
132 visitation shall include the following language: "In the event of noncompliance with this
133 order, the aggrieved party may file a verified motion for contempt. If custody, visitation, or
134 third-party custody is denied or interfered with by a parent or third party without good cause,
135 the aggrieved person may file a family access motion with the court stating the specific facts
136 that constitute a violation of the custody provisions of the judgment of dissolution, legal
137 separation, or judgment of paternity. The circuit clerk will provide the aggrieved party with
138 an explanation of the procedures for filing a family access motion and a simple form for use
139 in filing the family access motion. A family access motion does not require the assistance of
140 legal counsel to prepare and file.".
141 11. No court shall adopt any local rule, form, or practice requiring a standardized or
142 default parenting plan for interim, temporary, or permanent orders or judgments.
143 Notwithstanding any other provision of law to the contrary, a court may enter an interim
144 order in a proceeding under this chapter, provided that the interim order shall not contain any
145 provisions about child custody or a parenting schedule or plan without first providing the
146 parties with notice and a hearing, unless the parties otherwise agree.
147 12. Unless a parent has been denied custody rights pursuant to this section or
148 visitation rights under section 452.400, both parents shall have access to records and
149 information pertaining to a minor child including, but not limited to, medical, dental, and
150 school records. If the parent without custody has been granted restricted or supervised
151 visitation because the court has found that the parent with custody or any child has been the
152 victim of domestic violence, as defined in section 455.010, by the parent without custody, the
153 court may order that the reports and records made available pursuant to this subsection not
154 includetheaddressoftheparentwithcustodyorthechild. Acourtshallorderthatthereports

158 visitation rights under section 452.400, any judgment of dissolution or other applicable court
159 order shall specifically allow both parents access to such records and reports.
160 13. Except as otherwise precluded by state or federal law, if any individual,
161 professional, public or private institution or organization denies access or fails to provide or
162 disclose any and all records and information, including, but not limited to, past and present
163 dental, medical and school records pertaining to a minor child, to either parent upon the
HB 2789 6
164 written request of such parent, the court shall, upon its finding that the individual,
165 professional, public or private institution or organization denied such request without good
166 cause, order that party to comply immediately with such request and to pay to the prevailing
167 partyallcostsincurred,including,butnotlimitedto,attorney'sfeesandcourtcostsassociated

171 contained in section 452.340 and applicable supreme court rules in determining an amount
172 reasonable or necessary for the support of the child.
173 15. If the court finds that domestic violence or abuse as defined in section 455.010
174 has occurred, the court shall make specific findings of fact to show that the custody or
175 visitation arrangement ordered by the court best protects the child and the parent or other
176 family or household member who is the victim of domestic violence, as defined in section
177 455.010, and any other children for whom such parent has custodial or visitation rights from
178 any further harm.
179 16. If a dispute is brought before a court of this state involving the custody of an
180 in vitro human embryo, the court shall render a decision according to the following
181 standards:
182 (1) The court shall determine custody in accordance with the best interest of the
183 in vitro human embryo. It is presumed that it is in the best interest of the in vitro
184 human embryo to place him or her in the custody of the ovum donor or spermatozoon
185 donor who intends to develop the in vitro human embryo to birth, subject to rebuttal
186 evidence;
187 (2) The court shall resolve the dispute between the parties in the manner that
188 provides the best chance for the in vitro human embryo to develop and grow;
189 (3) The following persons have standing to petition the court or to intervene in a
190 case: the ovum donor; spermatozoon donor; or the surrogate, who shall have limited
191 standingforonlythoseembryosthathavebeenpreviouslyplacedinsidethewombofthe

193 (4) The court may uphold an agreement between the parties to an action
194 establishing or terminating parental rights as not against public policy; and
195 (5) All agreements, lawsuits, motions to modify, or any other motions regarding
196 the disposition of in vitro human embryos brought before the court shall be subject to
197 the provisions of this subsection. All decisions made by the court regarding the
198 disposition of in vitro human embryos prior to August 28, 2024, shall be open to
