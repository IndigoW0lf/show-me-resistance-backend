176 prevent a video lottery game operator or a video lottery
177 retailer from using a player rewards system as approved by
178 the commission. No player shall be required to enroll in a
179 rewards program offered by a video lottery game operator or
180 video lottery game retailer as a condition to play video
181 lottery games.
SB 1083 12

214 not play video lottery games, and such video lottery game

218 Video lottery game terminals shall not be visible from areas
219 normally occupied by minors and shall be placed within the

229 In addition to the placement and supervision requirements of
230 this subsection, a video lottery game operator shall provide

236 lottery game operators as reasonably and specifically
237 requested by the commission for any violation of law, rules,
238 or regulations governing the conduct of video lottery
239 games. A video lottery game operator that fails to review
240 such surveillance video and report any known violation of
241 law, rules, or regulations governing the conduct of video
242 lottery games in conformance with established commission
243 procedures may be subject to an administrative fine not to

244 exceed five thousand dollars. Any video lottery game

246 rules, or regulations governing the conduct of video lottery
247 games in conformance with established commission procedures
248 may be subject to an administrative fine not to exceed five
249 thousand dollars. In the event a video lottery game
250 operator or retailer is found to have knowingly committed a
251 violation governing the conduct of video lottery games, the
252 commission may impose an administrative fine not to exceed
253 five thousand dollars, suspend such operator's or retailer's
254 license for up to thirty days, or in the case of repeated
255 violations revoke such operator's or retailer's license for
256 a period of one year. Any video lottery game operator or
257 retailer aggrieved by the commission's decision in any
258 disciplinary action that results in the suspension or
259 revocation of such operator's or retailer's video lottery
260 game license may appeal such decision by filing an action in
261 circuit court. The commission shall refer a violation of
262 the criminal code, with any evidence thereof, to the
263 appropriate law enforcement officials. Video lottery game
264 retailers shall provide an intrusion detection system
265 capable of detecting unauthorized entrance of the video
266 lottery game retailer's establishment during nonbusiness
267 hours and shall report to the commission any unauthorized
268 entrance of the video lottery game retailer's
269 establishment. Such surveillance and intrusion detection
270 system shall meet specifications as defined by the
271 commission.
272 (2) A video lottery game operator shall post a sign in
273 a conspicuous location where such video lottery game
274 terminals are located, containing in red lettering at least

277 10. (1) Video lottery game operators shall pay the
278 commission thirty-six percent of the video lottery game
279 adjusted gross receipts, which shall be deposited in the
280 state lottery fund. The commission shall transfer the
281 amount received from the operator from the lottery fund to
282 the lottery proceeds fund after administrative expenses
283 equal to four percent of the video lottery game adjusted
284 gross receipts are paid to the municipality where a licensed
285 video lottery game retailer maintains an establishment
286 licensed for the operation of video lottery game terminals,
287 or if such licensed establishment is not located within the
288 corporate boundaries of a municipality, then the county
289 where such licensed establishment is located to reimburse
290 such municipality or county for administrative expenses, and
291 any administrative expenses for the commission that are not
292 covered by reimbursements from operators are deducted. Net
293 proceeds transferred to the lottery proceeds fund shall be
294 appropriated to public elementary and secondary education
295 and public institutions of higher education with an emphasis
296 on programs to promote science, technology, engineering, and
297 mathematics (STEM) and programs to promote workforce
298 development.
299 (2) Video lottery game operators shall retain sixty-
300 four percent of the video lottery game adjusted gross
301 receipts, a portion of which shall be utilized to pay for
302 administrative expenses which shall include the cost of the
303 centralized computer system, which cost shall be paid by
304 video lottery game operators in proportion to the number of
305 video lottery game terminals operated and shall not be
306 apportioned by the video lottery game operator among video
SB 1083 16
307 lottery game retailers to which it provides operations. The
308 remainder, after the costs of the centralized computer
309 system are paid, shall be divided between the video lottery
310 game operator and video lottery game retailer as agreed to
311 by the video lottery game operator and video lottery game
312 retailer under the freely negotiated agreement made under
313 subdivision (2) of subsection 7 of this section, unless the
314 video lottery game operator and video lottery game retailer
315 share the same ownership.
316 11. All revenues received by the commission from
317 license fees and any reimbursements associated with the
318 administration of the provisions of sections 313.425 to
319 313.435, and all interest earned thereon, shall be
320 considered administrative expenses and shall be deposited in
321 the state lottery fund. Moneys deposited into the state
322 lottery fund from license fees and any reimbursements of
323 commission administrative expenses to administer sections
324 313.425 to 313.435 shall be considered administrative
325 expenses and shall not be considered net proceeds pursuant
326 to article III, section 39(b) of the Missouri Constitution.
327 Subject to appropriation, up to one percent of such license
328 fees and reimbursements deposited to the credit of the state
329 lottery fund may be deposited to the credit of the
330 compulsive gamblers fund created under section 313.842. The
331 remainder of the money deposited in the state lottery fund
332 from video lottery game license fees and any reimbursements
333 of commission administrative expenses to enforce sections
334 313.425 to 313.435 shall, subject to appropriation, be used
335 for administrative expenses associated with supervising and
336 enforcing the provisions of sections 313.425 to 313.435.
337 12. The commission may contract with a state law
338 enforcement entity to assist in conducting investigations
SB 1083 17
339 into applicants for any video lottery game license and to
340 investigate violations by any video lottery game licensee of
341 any of the provisions of sections 313.425 to 313.435 or
342 state law regulating illegal gambling activities. A video
343 lottery game licensee suspected of a violation shall be
344 afforded an administrative hearing on the record, and any
345 action taken to impose a fine on such licensee, or to
346 suspend or revoke the ability of a licensee to offer lottery
347 game products for sale, shall be appealed to the
348 commission. Any such administrative suspension or
349 revocation upheld by the commission may be appealed by the
350 video lottery game licensee in a state court of competent
