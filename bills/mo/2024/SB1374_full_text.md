3 2. The court shall order a defendant convicted of the
4 offense of driving while intoxicated to pay restitution for
5 a child whose parent or guardian died as a result of such
6 offense.
7 3. Notwithstanding any provision of law under chapter
8 559 relating to restitution, and subject to subsection 4 of

15 nineteen years of age or older.

19 including:
20 (1) The financial needs and resources of the child;
21 (2) The financial needs and resources of the surviving
22 parent or guardian or other current guardian of the child,
23 including the state if the state is the guardian;
24 (3) The standard of living to which the child is
25 accustomed;
26 (4) The physical and emotional condition of the child
27 and the child's educational needs;
28 (5) The child's physical and legal custody

40 7. The order of restitution under this section shall
41 require the defendant to:
42 (1) Make restitution directly to the person or agency
43 that will accept and forward restitution payments to the
44 victim or other person eligible for restitution under this

54 no later than the first anniversary of the date of the
55 defendant's release from the facility. The defendant may
56 enter into a payment plan to address any arrearage that
57 exists on the date of the defendant's release. The

61 facility.
62 9. The amount of restitution paid under this section
63 shall be deducted from any civil judgment against the
64 defendant.
65 10. A restitution order issued under this section may
66 be enforced by the office of the attorney general, or by a
67 person or a parent or guardian of the person named in the
68 order to receive the restitution, in the same manner as a
69 judgment in a civil action.
