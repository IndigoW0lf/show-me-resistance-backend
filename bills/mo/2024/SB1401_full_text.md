INTRODUCED BY SENATOR BLACK.
5573S.01I KRISTINA MARTIN, Secretary
AN ACT
To repeal sections 104.436 and 104.1066, RSMo, and to enact in lieu thereof two new sections
relating to the employer contribution rate for certain higher education institutions.
Be it enacted by the General Assembly of the State of Missouri, as follows:
1 Section A. Sections 104.436 and 104.1066, RSMo, are
2 repealed and two new sections enacted in lieu thereof, to be
3 known as sections 104.436 and 104.1066, to read as follows:
1 104.436. 1. The board intends to follow a financing
2 pattern which computes and requires contribution amounts
3 which, expressed as percents of active member payroll, will
4 remain approximately level from year to year and from one
5 generation of citizens to the next generation. Such
6 contribution determinations require regular actuarial
7 valuations, which shall be made by the board's actuary,
8 using assumptions and methods adopted by the board after
9 consulting with its actuary. The entry age normal cost
10 valuation method shall be used in determining the normal
11 cost calculation.
12 2. At least ninety days before each regular session of
13 the general assembly, the board shall certify to the
14 division of budget the contribution rate necessary to cover
15 the liabilities of the plan administered by the system,
16 including costs of administration, expected to accrue during
17 the next appropriation period. The commissioner of
18 administration shall request appropriation of the amount
SB 1401 2
19 calculated pursuant to the provisions of this subsection.
20 Beginning August 28, 2024, in the event the board certifies
21 a contribution rate that exceeds twenty-eight and three-
22 quarters percent, the commissioner of administration shall
23 include in his or her appropriation request an amount equal
24 to the difference between the greater contribution rate and
25 twenty-eight and three-quarters percent of compensation for
26 the members of Harris-Stowe State University, Lincoln
27 University, Missouri State University, Missouri Southern
28 State University, Missouri Western State University,
29 Northwest Missouri State University, Southeast Missouri
30 State University, Southwest Missouri State University, State
31 Technical College of Missouri, Truman State University, and
32 University of Central Missouri. Following each pay period,
33 the commissioner of administration shall requisition and
34 certify the payment to the executive director of the
35 Missouri state employees' retirement system. The executive
36 director shall promptly deposit the amounts certified to the
37 credit of the Missouri state employees' retirement fund.
38 3. The employers of members of the system who are not
39 paid out of funds that have been deposited in the state
40 treasury shall remit promptly to the executive director an
41 amount equal to the amount which the state would have paid
42 if those members had been paid entirely from state funds,
43 except as provided in subsection 2 of this section. The
44 executive director shall promptly deposit the amounts
45 certified to the credit of the Missouri state employees'
46 retirement system fund.
47 4. These amounts are funds of the system, and shall
48 not be commingled with any funds in the state treasury.
1 104.1066. 1. The year 2000 plan intends to follow a
2 financing pattern which computes and requires contribution
SB 1401 3
3 amounts which, expressed as percents of active member
4 payroll, will remain approximately level from year to year
5 and from one generation of citizens to the next generation.
6 Such contribution determinations require regular actuarial
7 valuations, which shall be made by the board's actuary,
8 using assumptions and methods adopted by the board after
9 consulting with its actuary. The entry age-normal cost
10 valuation method shall be used in determining the normal
11 cost calculation. For purposes of this subsection and
12 section 104.436, the actuary shall determine a single
13 contribution rate applicable to both closed plan and year
14 2000 plan participants and, in determining such rate, make
15 estimates of the probabilities of closed plan participants
16 transferring to the year 2000 plan.
17 2. At least ninety days before each regular session of
18 the general assembly, the board of the Missouri state
19 employees' retirement system shall certify to the division
20 of budget the contribution rate necessary to cover the
21 liabilities of the year 2000 plan administered by such
22 system, including costs of administration, expected to
23 accrue during the next appropriation period. The
24 commissioner of administration shall request appropriations
25 based upon the contribution rate so certified. Beginning
26 August 28, 2024, in the event the board certifies a
27 contribution rate that exceeds twenty-eight and three-
28 quarters percent, the commissioner of administration shall
29 include in his or her appropriation request an amount equal
30 to the difference between the greater contribution rate and
31 twenty-eight and three-quarters percent of compensation for
32 the members of Harris-Stowe State University, Lincoln
33 University, Missouri State University, Missouri Southern
34 State University, Missouri Western State University,
SB 1401 4
35 Northwest Missouri State University, Southeast Missouri
36 State University, Southwest Missouri State University, State
37 Technical College of Missouri, Truman State University, and
38 University of Central Missouri. From appropriations so
39 made, the commissioner of administration shall certify
40 contribution amounts to the state treasurer who in turn
41 shall immediately pay the contributions to the year 2000
42 plan.
43 3. The employers of members covered by the Missouri
44 state employees' retirement system who are not paid out of
45 funds that have been deposited in the state treasury shall
46 remit following each pay period to the year 2000 plan an
47 amount equal to the amount which the state would have paid
48 if those members had been paid entirely from state funds,
49 except as provided in subsection 2 of this section. Such
50 employers shall maintain payroll records for a minimum of
51 five years and shall produce all such records as requested
52 by the system. The system is authorized to request from the
53 state office of administration an appropriation out of the
54 annual budget of any such employer in the event such records
55 indicate that such employer has not contributed the amounts
56 required by this section. The office of administration
57 shall request such appropriation which shall be equal to the
58 amount necessary to replace any shortfall in contributions
59 as determined by the system. From appropriations so made,
60 the commissioner of administration shall certify
61 contribution amounts to the state treasurer who in turn
62 shall immediately pay such contributions to the year 2000
63 plan.
64 4. At least ninety days before each regular session of
65 the general assembly, the board of the transportation
66 department and highway patrol retirement system shall
SB 1401 5
67 certify to the department of transportation and the
68 department of public safety the contribution rate necessary
69 to cover the liabilities of the year 2000 plan administered
70 by such system, including costs of administration, expected
71 to accrue during the next biennial or other appropriation
72 period. Each department shall include in its budget and in
73 its request for appropriations for personal service the sum
74 so certified to it by such board, and shall present the same
75 to the general assembly for allowance. The sums so
76 certified and appropriated, when available, shall be
77 immediately paid to the system and deposited in the highway
78 and transportation employees' and highway patrol retirement
79 and benefit fund.
80 5. These amounts are funds of the year 2000 plan and
81 shall not be commingled with any funds in the state treasury.
