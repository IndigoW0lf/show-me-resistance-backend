26 coordinating board for higher education shall have the following duties and responsibilities:
27 (1) The coordinating board for higher education may approve, not approve, or
28 provisionallyapprove proposed new degreeprograms to be offered by the state institutions of
29 higher education. The coordinating board may authorize a degree program outside an
30 institution's coordinating board-approved mission only when the coordinating board has

33 collaboration with an institution the mission of which includes offering the program;
34 (b) Is contributing substantially to the goals in the coordinating board's coordinated

45 these instances the University of Missouri will be the degree-granting institution. Should the
46 University of Missouri decline to collaborate in the offering of such programs, any of these
47 institutions may seek approval of the program through the coordinating board for higher
48 education's comprehensive review process when doing so would not unnecessarily duplicate
49 an existing program, collaboration is not feasible or a viable means of meeting the needs of
50 students and employers, and the institution has the academic and financial capacity to offer
51 the program in a high quality manner;
52 (3)] The coordinating board for higher education may promote and encourage the
53 development of cooperative agreements between Missouri public four-year institutions of
54 higher education which do not offer graduate degrees and Missouri public four-year
55 institutions of higher education which do offer graduate degrees for the purpose of offering
56 graduate degree programs on campuses of those public four-year institutions of higher
57 education which do not otherwise offer graduate degrees. Such agreements shall identify the
58 obligations and duties of the parties, including assignment of administrative responsibility.
59 Any diploma awarded for graduate degrees under such a cooperative agreement shall include
60 the names of both institutions inscribed thereon. Any cooperative agreement in place as of
61 August 28, 2003, shall require no further approval from the coordinating board for higher
62 education. Any costs incurred with respect to the administrative provisions of this
63 subdivision may be paid from state funds allocated to the institution assigned the
64 administrative authority for the program. The provisions of this subdivision shall not be
65 construed to invalidate the provisions of subdivision (1) of this subsection;

90 four-year higher education institutions to create by July 1, 2014, a statewide core transfer
91 library of at least twenty-five lower division courses across all institutions that are
92 transferable among all public higher education institutions. The coordinating board shall
93 establishpoliciesandprocedurestoensuresuchcoursesareacceptedintransferamongpublic
94 institutions and treated as equivalent to similar courses at the receiving institutions. The
95 coordinating board shall develop a policy to foster reverse transfer for any student who has
96 accumulated enough hours in combination with at least one public higher education
97 institution in Missouri that offers an associate degree and one public four-year higher
98 education institution in the prescribed courses sufficient to meet the public higher education
99 institution's requirements to be awarded an associate degree. The department of elementary
100 and secondary education shall maintain the alignment of the assessments found in section
101 160.518 and successor assessments with the competencies previously established under this

103 sciences, and social sciences associated with an institution's general education core;
104 [(10)] (9) The coordinating board shall collect the necessary information and develop
105 comparable data for all institutions of higher education in the state. The coordinating board
106 shall use this information to delineate the areas of competence of each of these institutions
107 and for any other purposes deemed appropriate by the coordinating board;
108 [(11)] (10) Compliance with requests from the coordinating board for institutional
109 information and the other powers, duties and responsibilities, herein assigned to the
110 coordinating board, shall be a prerequisite to the receipt of any funds which the coordinating
111 board is responsible for administering;
112 [(12)] (11) If any institution of higher education in this state, public or private,
113 willfully fails or refuses to follow any lawful guideline, policy or procedure established or
114 prescribed by the coordinating board, or knowingly deviates from any such guideline, or
115 knowingly acts without coordinating board approval where such approval is required, or
116 willfully fails to comply with any other lawful order of the coordinating board, the
117 coordinating board may, after a public hearing, withhold or direct to be withheld from that
118 institution any funds the disbursement of which is subject to the control of the coordinating
HB 2673 5
119 board, or may remove the approval of the institution as an approved institution within the
120 meaning of section 173.1102. If any such public institution willfully disregards board policy,
121 the commissioner of higher education may order such institution to remit a fine in an amount
122 not to exceed one percent of the institution's current fiscal year state operating appropriation
123 to the board. The board shall hold such funds until such time that the institution, as
124 determinedby the commissioner ofhigher education, corrects the violation, at which timethe
125 board shall refund such amount to the institution. If the commissioner determines that the
126 institution has not redressed the violation within one year, the fine amount shall be deposited
127 into the general revenue fund, unless the institution appeals such decision to the full
128 coordinating board, which shall have the authority to make a binding and final decision, by
129 meansofamajorityvote,regardingthematter. However,nothinginthissectionshallprevent
130 any institution of higher education in this state from presenting additional budget requests or

159 173.618. The rules shall ensure that, as of July 1, 2008, all out-of-state public institutions
160 seeking to offer degrees and courses within the state of Missouri are evaluated in a manner
161 similar to Missouri public higher education institutions. Such out-of-state public institutions
162 shall be held to standards no lower than the standards established by the coordinating board
163 for program approval and the policy guidelines of the coordinating board for data collection,
164 cooperation, and resolution of disputes between Missouri institutions of higher education
165 under this section. Any such out-of-state public institutions of higher education wishing to

176 shall be invalid and void.
177 (c) Nothing in this subdivision or in section 173.616 shall be construed or interpreted

63 of this review shall be to ensure that Missouri's system of higher education is responsive to
64 the state's needs and is focused, balanced, cost-effective, and characterized by programs of
65 high quality as demonstrated by student performance and program outcomes. As a
66 component of this review, each institution shall prepare, in a manner prescribed by the
67 coordinating board, a mission implementation plan for the coordinating board's consideration
68 and approval. If the coordinating board determines that an institution has qualified for a
69 mission change or additional targeted resources pursuant to review conducted under this

82 institutionfrom initiating a request to the coordinating board for a revision of its mission;and
83 (9) Reviewing applications from institutions seeking a statewide mission. Such
84 institutions shall provide evidence to the coordinating board that they have the capacity to
85 discharge successfully such a mission. Such evidence shall consist of the following:
86 (a) That the institution enrolls a representative cross-section of Missouri students.
87 Examplesofevidencefor meetingthis requirementwhichtheinstitutionmaypresentinclude,
88 but are not limited to, the following: enrolling at least forty percent of its Missouri resident,
89 first-timedegree-seekingfreshmenfromoutsideitshistoricstatutoryserviceregion;enrolling
90 its Missouri undergraduate students from at least eighty percent of all Missouri counties; or
91 enrolling one or more groups of special population students such as minorities, economically
92 disadvantaged, or physically disadvantaged from outside its historic statutory service region
93 at rates exceeding state averages of such populations enrolled in the higher educational
94 institutions of this state;
95 (b) That the institution offers one or more programs of unusual strength which
96 respond to a specific statewide need. Examples of evidence of meeting this requirement
97 which the institution may present include, but are not limited to, the following: receipt of
98 national, discipline-specific accreditation when available; receipt of independent certification
99 for meeting national or state standards or requirements when discipline-specific accreditation
100 is not available; for occupationally specific programs, placement rates significantly higher
101 than average; for programs for which state or national licensure is required or for which state
102 or national licensure or registration is available on a voluntary basis, licensure or registration
103 rates for graduates seeking such recognition significantly higher than average; or quality of
104 program faculty as measured by the percentage holding terminal degrees, the percentage
105 writing publications in professional journals or other appropriate media, and the percentage
106 securing competitively awarded research grants which are higher than average;
107 (c) Thattheinstitutionhasaclearlyarticulatedadmissionstandardconsistentwiththe
108 provisions of subdivision [(6)] (5) of subsection 2 of section 173.005 or section 174.130;
109 (d) That the institution is characterized by a focused academic environment which
110 identifies specific but limited areas of academic emphasis at the undergraduate, and if
111 appropriate, at the graduate and professional school levels, including the identification of
112 programs to be continued, reduced, terminated or targeted for excellence. The institution
113 shall, consistent with its focused academic environment, also have the demonstrable capacity
114 to provide significant public service or research support that address statewide needs for
115 constituencies beyond its historic statutory service region; and
116 (e) That the institution has adopted and maintains a program of continuous quality
117 improvement, or the equivalent of such a program, and reports annually appropriate and
HB 2673 11
118 verifiable measures of institutional accountability related to such program. Such measures
119 shall include, but not be limited to, indicators of student achievement and institutional
120 mission attainment such as percentage of students meeting institutional admission standards;
121 success of remediation programs, if offered; student retention rate; student graduation rate;
122 objective measures of student, alumni, and employer satisfaction; objective measures of
123 student learning in general education and the major, including written and oral
124 communication skills and critical thinking skills; percentage of students attending graduate
125 or professional schools; student placement, licensure and professional registration rates when
126 appropriate to a program's objectives; objective measures of successful attainment of
127 statewide goals as may be expressed from time to time by the coordinating board or by the
128 general assembly; and objective measures of faculty teaching effectiveness. In the
129 development and evaluation of these institutional accountability reports, the coordinating
130 board and institutions are expected to use multiple measures of success, including nationally
131 developed and verified as well as locally developed and independently verified assessment
132 instruments; however, preference shall be given to nationally developed instruments when
133 they are available and if they are appropriate. Institutions which serve or seek to serve a
134 statewide mission shall be judged to have met the prerequisites for such a mission when they
135 demonstrate to the coordinating board that they have met the criteria described in this
136 subdivision. As a component of this process, each institution shall prepare, in a manner
137 prescribed by the coordinating board, a mission implementation plan for the coordinating
138 board's consideration and approval.

4 procedure for annually reporting the performance of graduates of public high schools in the
5 state during the student's initial year in the public colleges and universities of the state. The
6 purpose of such reports shall be to assist in determining how high schools are preparing
7 students for successful college and university performance. The report produced pursuant to
8 this subsection shall annually be furnished to the state board of education for reporting
9 pursuant to subsection 4 of section 161.610 and shall not be used for any other purpose until
10 such time that a standard process and consistent, specific criteria for determining a student's
11 need for remedial coursework is agreed upon by the coordinating board for higher education,
12 higher education institutions, and the state board of education.
13 2. The proceduresshall be designedsothat the reportingis madeby the nameofeach
14 high school in the state, with individual student data to be grouped according to the high
15 school from which the students graduated. The data in the reports shall be disaggregated by
16 race and sex. The procedures shall not be designed so that the reporting contains the name of
HB 2673 14
17 any student. No grade point average shall be disclosed under subsection 3 of this section in
18 any case where three or fewer students from a particular high school attend a particular
19 college or university.
20 3. The data reported shall include grade point averages after the initial college year,
21 calculated on, or adjusted to, a four point grade scale; the percentage of students returning to
22 college after the first and second half of the initial college year, or after each trimester of the
23 initial college year; the percentage of students taking noncollege level classes in basic
24 academiccourses during the first college year, or remedial courses in basic academic subjects
25 of English, mathematics, or reading; and other such data as determined by rule and regulation
26 of the coordinating board for higher education.

28 its policies and procedures relating to remedial education in light of the best practices in
29 remediation identified as required by subdivision [(7)] (6) of subsection 2 of section 173.005
30 to ensure that school districts are informed about best practices to reduce the need for
31 remediation. The department shall present its results to the joint committee on education by

174.160. The board of regents of each state college and each state teachers college
2 shall have power and authority to confer upon students, by diploma under the common seal,
3 such degrees as are usually granted by such colleges, and additional degrees only when
4 authorized by the coordinating board for higher education in circumstances in which offering
5 such degree would not unnecessarily duplicate an existing program, collaboration is not
6 feasible or a viable means of meeting the needs of students and employers, and the institution
7 has the academic and financial capacity to offer the program in a high-quality manner. In the
8 case of nonresearch doctoral degrees in allied health professions, an institution may be
9 authorized to offer such degree independently if offering it in collaboration with another
10 institution would not increase the quality of the program or allow it to be delivered more
11 efficiently. [Such boards shall have the power and authority to confer degrees in engineering
12 only in collaboration with the University of Missouri, provided that such collaborative
13 agreementsareapprovedbythegoverningboardofeachinstitutionandthatintheseinstances
14 the University of Missouri will be the degree-granting institution. Should the University of

16 seek approval of the program through the coordinating board for higher education's
17 comprehensive review process when doing so would not unnecessarily duplicate an existing
18 program, collaboration is not feasible or a viable means of meeting the needs of students and
19 employers, and the institution has the academic and financial capacity to offer the program in
20 a high-quality manner.]
