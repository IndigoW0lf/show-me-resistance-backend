46 et seq.), as amended, for nursing facilities. The MO
47 HealthNet division may recognize through its payment
48 methodology for nursing facilities those nursing facilities
49 which serve a high volume of MO HealthNet patients. The MO
50 HealthNet division when determining the amount of the
51 benefit payments to be made on behalf of persons under the

81 (8) Drugs and medicines when prescribed by a licensed
82 physician, dentist, podiatrist, or an advanced practice
83 registered nurse; except that no payment for drugs and

87 person who qualifies for prescription drug coverage under
88 the provisions of P.L. 108-173;

105 further provided, however, that such family planning
106 services shall not include abortions or any abortifacient
107 drug or device that is used for the purpose of inducing an
108 abortion unless such abortions are certified in writing by a
109 physician to the MO HealthNet agency that, in the
110 physician's professional judgment, the life of the mother
111 would be endangered if the fetus were carried to term;
112 (13) Inpatient psychiatric hospital services for

117 presurgical diagnostic services performed in ambulatory
118 surgical facilities which are licensed by the department of

126 (15) Personal care services which are medically
127 oriented tasks having to do with a person's physical
128 requirements, as opposed to housekeeping requirements, which
129 enable a person to be treated by his or her physician on an
130 outpatient rather than on an inpatient or residential basis
131 in a hospital, intermediate care facility, or skilled
132 nursing facility. Personal care services shall be rendered
133 by an individual not a member of the participant's family
134 who is qualified to provide such services where the services
SB 1168 7
135 are prescribed by a physician in accordance with a plan of
136 treatment and are supervised by a licensed nurse. Persons
137 eligible to receive personal care services shall be those
138 persons who would otherwise require placement in a hospital,
139 intermediate care facility, or skilled nursing facility.
140 Benefits payable for personal care services shall not exceed
141 for any one participant one hundred percent of the average
142 statewide charge for care and treatment in an intermediate
143 care facility for a comparable period of time. Such
144 services, when delivered in a residential care facility or
145 assisted living facility licensed under chapter 198 shall be
146 authorized on a tier level based on the services the
147 resident requires and the frequency of the services. A
148 resident of such facility who qualifies for assistance under
149 section 208.030 shall, at a minimum, if prescribed by a
150 physician, qualify for the tier level with the fewest
151 services. The rate paid to providers for each tier of
152 service shall be set subject to appropriations. Subject to
153 appropriations, each resident of such facility who qualifies
154 for assistance under section 208.030 and meets the level of
155 care required in this section shall, at a minimum, if
156 prescribed by a physician, be authorized up to one hour of
157 personal care services per day. Authorized units of
158 personal care services shall not be reduced or tier level
159 lowered unless an order approving such reduction or lowering
160 is obtained from the resident's personal physician. Such
161 authorized units of personal care services or tier level
162 shall be transferred with such resident if he or she
163 transfers to another such facility. Such provision shall
164 terminate upon receipt of relevant waivers from the federal
165 Department of Health and Human Services. If the Centers for
166 Medicare and Medicaid Services determines that such
SB 1168 8
167 provision does not comply with the state plan, this
168 provision shall be null and void. The MO HealthNet division
169 shall notify the revisor of statutes as to whether the
170 relevant waivers are approved or a determination of
171 noncompliance is made;
172 (16) Mental health services. The state plan for
173 providing medical assistance under Title XIX of the Social
174 Security Act, 42 U.S.C. Section 301, as amended, shall
175 include the following mental health services when such
176 services are provided by community mental health facilities

180 child-serving agency within the comprehensive children's
181 mental health service system established in section
182 630.097. The department of mental health shall establish by
183 administrative rule the definition and criteria for
184 designation as a community mental health facility and for
185 designation as an alcohol and drug abuse facility. Such
186 mental health services shall include:

379 behavioral function. The MO HealthNet division shall
380 establish by administrative rule the definition and criteria
381 for designation of a comprehensive day rehabilitation
382 service facility, benefit limitations and payment
383 mechanism. Any rule or portion of a rule, as that term is

385 authority delegated in this subdivision shall become
386 effective only if it complies with and is subject to all of
387 the provisions of chapter 536 and, if applicable, section
388 536.028. This section and chapter 536 are nonseverable and
SB 1168 15
389 if any of the powers vested with the general assembly
390 pursuant to chapter 536 to review, to delay the effective
391 date, or to disapprove and annul a rule are subsequently
392 held unconstitutional, then the grant of rulemaking
393 authority and any rule proposed or adopted after August 28,
394 2005, shall be invalid and void.
395 3. The MO HealthNet division may require any
396 participant receiving MO HealthNet benefits to pay part of
397 the charge or cost until July 1, 2008, and an additional
398 payment after July 1, 2008, as defined by rule duly
399 promulgated by the MO HealthNet division, for all covered
400 services except for those services covered under
401 subdivisions (15) and (16) of subsection 1 of this section
402 and sections 208.631 to 208.657 to the extent and in the
403 manner authorized by Title XIX of the federal Social
404 Security Act (42 U.S.C. Section 1396, et seq.) and
405 regulations thereunder. When substitution of a generic drug
406 is permitted by the prescriber according to section 338.056,
407 and a generic drug is substituted for a name-brand drug, the
408 MO HealthNet division may not lower or delete the
409 requirement to make a co-payment pursuant to regulations of
410 Title XIX of the federal Social Security Act. A provider of
411 goods or services described under this section must collect
412 from all participants the additional payment that may be
413 required by the MO HealthNet division under authority
414 granted herein, if the division exercises that authority, to
415 remain eligible as a provider. Any payments made by
416 participants under this section shall be in addition to and
417 not in lieu of payments made by the state for goods or
418 services described herein except the participant portion of
419 the pharmacy professional dispensing fee shall be in
420 addition to and not in lieu of payments to pharmacists. A
SB 1168 16
421 provider may collect the co-payment at the time a service is
422 provided or at a later date. A provider shall not refuse to
423 provide a service if a participant is unable to pay a
424 required payment. If it is the routine business practice of
425 a provider to terminate future services to an individual
426 with an unclaimed debt, the provider may include uncollected
427 co-payments under this practice. Providers who elect not to
428 undertake the provision of services based on a history of
429 bad debt shall give participants advance notice and a
430 reasonable opportunity for payment. A provider,
