1 393.170. 1. No gas corporation, electrical

9 transmission of electricity in excess of two hundred thirty
10 kilovolts, or any structure containing transmission lines
11 that are capable of transmitting electricity in excess of
12 two hundred thirty total kilovolts where the voltage of all

17 2. No such corporation shall exercise any right or
