AN ACT
To repeal section 67.1850, RSMo, and to enact in lieu thereof one new section relating to
geographical information systems products.
Be it enacted by the General Assembly of the state of Missouri, as follows:
Section A. Section 67.1850, RSMo, is repealed and one new section enacted in lieu
2 thereof, to be known as section 67.1850, to read as follows:
67.1850. 1. As used in this section, the following terms mean:
2 (1) "Community", any municipality or county as defined in this section;
3 (2) "County", any county form of government;
4 (3) "Geographical information system", a computerized, spatial coordinate mapping
5 and relational database technology which:
6 (a) Captures, assembles, stores, converts, manages, analyzes, amalgamates and
7 records, in the digital mode, all kinds and types of information and data;
8 (b) Transforms such information and data into intelligence and subsequently

10 decisions necessary for sound management;
11 (4) "Municipality", any city located in any county.
12 2. The development of geographical information systems has not been undertaken in
13 any large-scale and useful way by private enterprise. The use of modern technology can
14 enhance the planning and decision-making processes of communities. The development of
15 geographical information systems is a time-consuming and expensive activity. In the interest
16 of maintaining community governments open and accessible to the public, information
17 gathered by communities for use in a geographical information system, unless properly made

19 way by which a person could render the investment of the public in a geographical
20 information system a special benefit to that person, and not to the public, should not be
21 permitted.

23 system for the community. The scope of the geographical information system shall be
24 determined by the governing body of the community. The method of creation, maintenance,
25 use and distribution of the geographical information system shall be determined by the
26 governing body of the community. A community shall not mandate the use of this system or
27 allocate the costs of the system to nonusers.

37 610.026. A community maintaining a geographical information system shall make maps and
38 other products of the system available to the public. The cost of the map or other product
39 shall not exceed a reasonable fee representing the replacement cost [to the community of
40 time, equipment and personnel in the production of the map or other product] of the
41 materials provided. A community may license the use of a geographical information
42 system. The total cost of licensing a geographical information system may not exceed the
43 cost, as established by section 610.026, of the:
44 (1) Cost to the community [of time, equipment and personnel] in the production of
45 the information in a geographical information system or the production of the geographical
