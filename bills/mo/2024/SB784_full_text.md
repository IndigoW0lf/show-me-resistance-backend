16 this section, the commissioner of education is authorized to
17 reduce the required number of hours or days in which the

26 Such reduction shall not extend beyond two calendar years in
27 duration.
1 163.021. 1. A school district shall receive state aid
2 for its education program only if it:

12 shall count as a school day including afternoon session
13 kindergarten students] at least a minimum school term as

17 hours by more than twelve hours for all-day students or six
18 hours for one-half-day kindergarten students, all such hours

37 assessed valuation of the district; and
38 (4) Computes average daily attendance as defined in
39 subdivision (2) of section 163.011 as modified by section
40 171.031. Whenever there has existed within the district an

42 condition whereby the school attendance is substantially
43 reduced for an extended period in any school year, the
44 apportionment of school funds and all other distribution of
45 school moneys shall be made on the basis of the school year
46 next preceding the year in which such condition existed.
47 2. For the 2006-07 school year and thereafter, no
48 school district shall receive more state aid, as calculated
49 under subsections 1 and 2 of section 163.031, for its

54 and free textbook payment amounts, unless it has an
55 operating levy for school purposes, as determined pursuant
SB 784 7
56 to section 163.011, of not less than two dollars and seventy-
57 five cents after all adjustments and reductions. Any
58 district which is required, pursuant to Article X, Section
59 22 of the Missouri Constitution, to reduce its operating
60 levy below the minimum tax rate otherwise required under
61 this subsection shall not be construed to be in violation of
62 this subsection for making such tax rate reduction.
63 Pursuant to Section 10(c) of Article X of the state
64 constitution, a school district may levy the operating levy
65 for school purposes required by this subsection less all
66 adjustments required pursuant to Article X, Section 22 of
67 the Missouri Constitution if such rate does not exceed the
68 highest tax rate in effect subsequent to the 1980 tax year.
69 Nothing in this section shall be construed to mean that a
70 school district is guaranteed to receive an amount not less
71 than the amount the school district received per eligible
72 pupil for the school year 1990-91. The provisions of this
73 subsection shall not apply to any school district located in
74 a county of the second classification which has a nuclear
75 power plant located in such district or to any school
76 district located in a county of the third classification
77 which has an electric power generation unit with a rated
78 generating capacity of more than one hundred fifty megawatts
79 which is owned or operated or both by a rural electric
80 cooperative except that such school districts may levy for
81 current school purposes and capital projects an operating
82 levy not to exceed two dollars and seventy-five cents less
83 all adjustments required pursuant to Article X, Section 22
84 of the Missouri Constitution.
85 3. No school district shall receive more state aid, as
86 calculated in section 163.031, for its education program,
87 exclusive of categorical add-ons, than it received per
SB 784 8
88 eligible pupil for the school year 1993-94, if the state
89 board of education determines that the district was not in
90 compliance in the preceding school year with the
91 requirements of section 163.172, until such time as the
92 board determines that the district is again in compliance
93 with the requirements of section 163.172.
94 4. No school district shall receive state aid,
95 pursuant to section 163.031, if such district was not in
96 compliance, during the preceding school year, with the
97 requirement, established pursuant to section 160.530 to
98 allocate revenue to the professional development committee
99 of the district.
100 5. No school district shall receive more state aid, as
101 calculated in subsections 1 and 2 of section 163.031, for
102 its education program, exclusive of categorical add-ons,
103 than it received per weighted average daily attendance for
104 the school year 2005-06 from the foundation formula, line
105 14, gifted, remedial reading, exceptional pupil aid, fair
106 share, and free textbook payment amounts, if the district
107 did not comply in the preceding school year with the
108 requirements of subsection 5 of section 163.031.
109 6. Any school district that levies an operating levy
110 for school purposes that is less than the performance levy,
111 as such term is defined in section 163.011, shall provide
112 written notice to the department of elementary and secondary
113 education asserting that the district is providing an
114 adequate education to the students of such district. If a
115 school district asserts that it is not providing an adequate
116 education to its students, such inadequacy shall be deemed
117 to be a result of insufficient local effort. The provisions
118 of this subsection shall not apply to any special district
119 established under sections 162.815 to 162.940.

9 located wholly or partially in a county with a charter form
10 of government or a school district located wholly or
11 partially in a city with more than thirty thousand
12 inhabitants.
13 2. (1) A school board may adopt the provisions of

20 qualified voters at the next date available for public
21 elections pursuant to chapter 115 and by July first of the
22 school year in which the four-day school week is proposed to
23 commence. If a majority of the votes cast on the question
24 by the qualified voters voting thereon are in favor of the
25 measure, then the provisions of subsection 1 of this section
26 shall become effective. If a majority of the votes cast on
27 the question by the qualified voters voting thereon are
28 opposed to the measure, then the board shall not adopt the
29 provisions of subsection 1 of this section unless and until
