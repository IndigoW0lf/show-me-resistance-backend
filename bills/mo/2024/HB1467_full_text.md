17 regardless of the year in which such costs were incurred or whether such costs were
18 considered in any prior year. The assessor shall annually assess all real property in the
19 following manner: new assessed values shall be determined as of January 1, 2027, and
20 every January first of each fourth year thereafter for the valuation of subclass (1) real
21 property or as of January first of each odd-numbered year for the valuation of real
22 property in subclassess (2) and (3) and shall be entered in the assessor's books; those same
23 assessed values shall apply in the following three years for subclass (1) real property or in
24 the following even-numbered year for real property in subclassess (2) and (3), except for
25 new construction and property improvements which shall be valued as though they had been
26 completed as of January first of the preceding new assessment year for subclass (1) real
27 property or the preceding odd-numbered year for real property in subclasses (2) and (3).
28 The assessor may call at the office, place of doing business, or residence of each person
29 required by this chapter to list property, and require the person to make a correct statement of
30 all taxable tangible personal property owned by the person or under his or her care, charge or
31 management, taxable in the county. On or before January first of the first year of the
32 four-year period in which the newly assessed values apply to subclass (1) real property,
33 the assessor shall prepare and submit a four-year assessment maintenance plan for
34 subclass(1)realpropertytothecountygoverningbodyandthestatetaxcommissionfor
35 their respective approval or modification. On or before January first of each even-
36 numbered year for real property in subclasses (2) and (3), the assessor shall prepare and
37 submit a two-year assessment maintenance plan to the county governing body and the state
38 tax commission for their respective approval or modification. The county governing body
39 shall approve and forward such plan or its alternative to the plan to the state tax commission
40 by February first. If the county governing body fails to forward the plan or its alternative to
41 the plan to the state tax commission by February first, the assessor's plan shall be considered
42 approved by the county governing body. If the state tax commission fails to approve a plan
43 and if the state tax commission and the assessor and the governing body of the county
44 involved are unable to resolve the differences, in order to receive state cost-share funds
45 outlined in section 137.750, the county or the assessor shall petition the administrative
46 hearing commission, by May first, to decide all matters in dispute regarding the assessment
47 maintenance plan. Upon agreement of the parties, the matter may be stayed while the parties
48 proceed with mediation or arbitration upon terms agreed to by the parties. The final decision
49 of the administrative hearing commission shall be subject to judicial review in the circuit
50 court of the countyinvolved. In the event a valuation of subclass (1) real property within any
51 county with a charter form of government, or within a city not within a county, is made by a
52 computer, computer-assisted method or a computer program, the burden of proof, supported
53 by clear, convincing and cogent evidence to sustain such valuation, shall be on the assessor at
HB 1467 3
54 any hearing or appeal. In any such county, unless the assessor proves otherwise, there shall

57 (1) The findings of the assessor based on an appraisal of the property by generally
58 accepted appraisal techniques; and
59 (2) The purchase prices from sales of at least three comparable properties and the
60 address or location thereof. As used in this subdivision, the word "comparable" means that:
61 (a) Such sale was closed at a date relevant to the property valuation; and
62 (b) Such properties are not more than one mile from the site of the disputed property,
63 except where no similar properties exist within one mile of the disputed property, the nearest
64 comparable property shall be used. Such property shall be within five hundred square feet in

67 2. Assessors in each county of this state and the City of St. Louis may send personal
68 property assessment forms through the mail.
69 3. The following items of personal property shall each constitute separate subclasses
70 of tangible personal property and shall be assessed and valued for the purposes of taxation at

73 one percent;

85 135.200, twenty-five percent.

87 property, in a printed blank prepared for that purpose. The statement, after being filled out,

98 or purpose of such real property is changed after such property is assessed under the
99 provisions of this chapter. If the assessor determines that such property shall be reclassified,
100 he or she shall determine the assessment under this subsection based on the percentage of the
101 tax year that such property was classified in each subclassification.
102 6. Manufactured homes, as defined in section 700.010, which are actually used as
103 dwelling units shall be assessed at the same percentage of true value as residential real
104 property for the purpose of taxation. The percentage of assessment of true value for such
105 manufactured homes shall be the same as for residential real property. If the county collector
106 cannot identify or find the manufactured home when attempting to attach the manufactured
107 home for payment of taxes owed by the manufactured home owner, the county collector may
108 request the county commission to have the manufactured home removed from the tax books,
109 and such request shall be granted within thirty days after the request is made; however, the
110 removal from the tax books does not remove the tax lien on the manufactured home if it is
111 later identified or found. For purposes of this section, a manufactured home located in a
112 manufactured home rental park, rental community or on real estate not owned by the
113 manufactured home owner shall be considered personal property. For purposes of this
114 section, a manufactured home located on real estate owned by the manufactured home owner
115 may be considered real property.
116 7. Each manufactured home assessed shall be considered a parcel for the purpose of
117 reimbursement pursuant to section 137.750, unless the manufactured home is deemed to be
118 realestate asdefined in subsection7 of section442.015 and assessedas a realtyimprovement
119 to the existing real estate parcel.
120 8. Any amount of tax due and owing based on the assessment of a manufactured
121 home shall be included on the personal property tax statement of the manufactured home
122 owner unless the manufactured home is deemed to be real estate as defined in subsection 7 of
123 section 442.015, in which case the amount of tax due and owing on the assessment of the
124 manufactured home as a realty improvement to the existing real estate parcel shall be
125 included on the real property tax statement of the real estate owner.

132 two years old or newer from a vehicle's model year, the assessor may use a value other than
133 average without performing a physical inspection of the motor vehicle. In the absence of a
134 listing for a particular motor vehicle in such publication, the assessor shall use such
135 information or publications which in the assessor's judgment will fairly estimate the true
136 value in money of the motor vehicle.
137 10. Before the assessor may increase the assessed valuation of any parcel of subclass
138 (1) real property by more than fifteen percent since the last assessment, excluding increases
139 due to new construction or improvements, the assessor shall conduct a physical inspection of
140 such property.
141 11. If a physical inspection is required, pursuant to subsection 10 of this section, the
142 assessor shall notify the property owner of that fact in writing and shall provide the owner
143 clear written notice of the owner's rights relating to the physical inspection. If a physical
144 inspection is required, the property owner may request that an interior inspection be
145 performed during the physical inspection. The owner shall have no less than thirty days to
146 notify the assessor of a request for an interior physical inspection.
