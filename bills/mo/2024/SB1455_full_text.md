43 chapter.
44 3. This chapter shall not be construed to prohibit the
45 use of auxiliary personnel under the direct supervision of a
46 pharmacist from assisting the pharmacist in any of his or
47 her duties. This assistance in no way is intended to

SB 1455 3
50 responsible for the actions of the auxiliary personnel
51 acting in his or her assistance.
52 4. This chapter shall not be construed to prohibit or
53 interfere with any legally registered practitioner of

68 arrangement under section 334.104, or from a physician
69 assistant engaged in a collaborative practice arrangement
70 under section 334.735.
71 6. Nothing in this section shall be construed as to

74 that a licensed pharmacist is in charge of such pharmacy.
75 7. Nothing in this section shall be construed to apply

82 a written protocol with a pharmacist for medication

88 arts, under section 334.125, and the state board of
89 pharmacy, under section 338.140, shall jointly promulgate
90 rules regulating the use of protocols for medication therapy
91 services. Such rules shall require protocols to include
92 provisions allowing for timely communication between the

99 medication therapy services. Any rule or portion of a rule,
100 as that term is defined in section 536.010, that is created
101 under the authority delegated in this section shall become
102 effective only if it complies with and is subject to all of
103 the provisions of chapter 536 and, if applicable, section
104 536.028. This section and chapter 536 are nonseverable and
105 if any of the powers vested with the general assembly
106 pursuant to chapter 536 to review, to delay the effective
107 date, or to disapprove and annul a rule are subsequently
108 held unconstitutional, then the grant of rulemaking
109 authority and any rule proposed or adopted after August 28,
110 2007, shall be invalid and void.
111 11. The state board of pharmacy may grant a
112 certificate of medication therapeutic plan authority to a
113 licensed pharmacist who submits proof of successful

119 recognized professional organization and approved by the
120 board of pharmacy.

124 medication therapeutic plan as defined by a written protocol
125 from a physician that may be specific to each patient for
126 care by a pharmacist.
127 13. Nothing in this section shall be construed to
128 allow a pharmacist to make a therapeutic substitution of a
129 pharmaceutical prescribed by a physician unless authorized
130 by the written protocol or the physician's prescription
131 order.
