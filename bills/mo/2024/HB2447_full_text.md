7 rhetoric; and mathematical skills, including arithmetic, geometry, music, and
8 astronomy. Historically, a classical education focuses on three bodies of knowledge:
9 the human sciences, including literature, history, and philosophy; the natural sciences,
10 includingbiology,chemistry,andphysics;andthetheologicalsciences,includingdogma,
11 ethics, and apologetics.
12 2. Subject to appropriation, the department of elementary and secondary
13 education shall establish the "Classical Education Grant Program" pursuant to the
14 provisions of this section.
15 3. (1) There is hereby created in the state treasury the "Classical Education
16 Grant Program Fund". The fund shall consist of any appropriations to such fund and
17 any gifts, bequests, or donations to such fund. The state treasurer shall be custodian of

22 for the purpose of providing grants to eligible school districts to provide classical
23 education programs as specified in this section.
24 (2) Notwithstanding the provisions of section 33.080 to the contrary, any moneys
25 remaining in the fund at the end of the biennium shall not revert to the credit of the
26 general revenue fund.
27 (3) The state treasurer shall invest moneys in the fund in the same manner as
28 other funds are invested. Any interest and moneys earned on such investments shall be

45 authority delegated in this section shall become effective only if it complies with and is
46 subject to all of the provisions of chapter 536 and, if applicable, section 536.028. This
47 section and chapter 536 are nonseverable and if any of the powers vested with the
48 general assembly pursuant to chapter 536 to review, to delay the effective date, or to
49 disapprove and annul a rule are subsequently held unconstitutional, then the grant of
50 rulemaking authority and any rule proposed or adopted after August 28, 2024, shall be
51 invalid and void.
