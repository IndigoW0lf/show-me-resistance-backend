76 energy produced or consumed during the billing period in accordance with normal metering
77 practices for customers in the same rate class, either by employing a single, bidirectional
78 meter that measures the amount of electrical energy produced and consumed, or by
79 employingmultiplemetersthatseparatelymeasurethecustomer-generator'sconsumptionand
80 production of electricity;
81 (2) If the electricity supplied by the supplier exceeds the electricity generated by the
82 customer-generator during a billing period, the customer-generator shall be billed for the net
83 electricity supplied by the supplier in accordance with normal practices for customers in the
84 same rate class;
85 (3) If the electricity generated by the customer-generator exceeds the electricity
86 supplied by the supplier during a billing period, the customer-generator shall be billed for the
87 appropriate customer charges for that billing period in accordance with subsection 3 of this
88 sectionandshall becreditedan amount atleast equaltothe[avoided fuelcost] billingrateof
89 the excess kilowatt-hours generated during the billing period, with this credit applied to the
90 following billing period;

91 (4) Any remaining credits granted by this subsection shall [expire without any
92 compensation at the earlier of either twelve months after their issuance] be refunded to the
93 customer-generator at the end of each calendar year or when the customer-generator
94 disconnects service or terminates the net metering relationship with the supplier;
95 (5) For any rural electric cooperative under chapter 394, or any municipally owned
96 utility, upon agreement of the wholesale generator supplying electric energy to the retail
97 electric supplier, at the option of the retail electric supplier, the credit to the customer-
98 generator may be provided by the wholesale generator.
