INTRODUCED BY SENATOR CIERPIOT.
5925S.01I KRISTINA MARTIN, Secretary
AN ACT
To repeal section 260.205, RSMo, and to enact in lieu thereof one new section relating to solid
waste permits.
Be it enacted by the General Assembly of the State of Missouri, as follows:
1 Section A. Section 260.205, RSMo, is repealed and one new
2 section enacted in lieu thereof, to be known as section 260.205,
3 to read as follows:
1 260.205. 1. It shall be unlawful for any person to
2 operate a solid waste processing facility or solid waste
3 disposal area of a solid waste management system without
4 first obtaining an operating permit from the department. It
5 shall be unlawful for any person to construct a solid waste
6 processing facility or solid waste disposal area without
7 first obtaining a construction permit from the department
8 pursuant to this section. A current authorization to
9 operate issued by the department pursuant to sections
10 260.200 to 260.345 shall be considered to be a permit to
11 operate for purposes of this section for all solid waste
12 disposal areas and processing facilities existing on August
13 28, 1995. A permit shall not be issued for a sanitary
14 landfill to be located in a flood area, as determined by the
15 department, where flood waters are likely to significantly
16 erode final cover. A permit shall not be required to
17 operate a waste stabilization lagoon, settling pond or other
18 water treatment facility which has a valid permit from the
SB 1469 2
19 Missouri clean water commission even though the facility may
20 receive solid or semisolid waste materials.
21 2. No person or operator may apply for or obtain a
22 permit to construct a solid waste disposal area unless the
23 person has requested the department to conduct a preliminary
24 site investigation and obtained preliminary approval from
25 the department. The department shall, within sixty days of
26 such request, conduct a preliminary investigation and
27 approve or disapprove the site.
28 3. All proposed solid waste disposal areas for which a
29 preliminary site investigation request pursuant to
30 subsection 2 of this section is received by the department
31 on or after August 28, 1999, shall be subject to a public

121 for this demonstration shall also submit evidence of
122 financial responsibility for that corporation and any other
123 subsidiary thereof.
124 (2) Every applicant shall provide a financial
125 assurance instrument or instruments to the department prior
126 to the granting of a construction permit for a solid waste
127 disposal area. The financial assurance instrument or
128 instruments shall be irrevocable, meet all requirements
129 established by the department and shall not be cancelled,
130 revoked, disbursed, released or allowed to terminate without
131 the approval of the department. After the cessation of
132 active operation of a sanitary landfill, or other solid
133 waste disposal area as designed by the department, neither
134 the guarantor nor the operator shall cancel, revoke or
135 disburse the financial assurance instrument or allow the
136 instrument to terminate until the operator is released from
137 postclosure monitoring and care responsibilities pursuant to
138 section 260.227.
139 (3) The applicant for a permit to construct a solid
140 waste disposal area shall provide the department with plans,
141 specifications, and such other data as may be necessary to
142 comply with the purpose of sections 260.200 to 260.345. The
143 application shall demonstrate compliance with all applicable
144 local planning and zoning requirements. The department
145 shall make an investigation of the solid waste disposal area
146 and determine whether it complies with the provisions of
SB 1469 6
147 sections 260.200 to 260.345 and the rules and regulations
148 adopted pursuant to sections 260.200 to 260.345. Within
149 twelve consecutive months of the receipt of an application
150 for a construction permit the department shall approve or
151 deny the application. The department shall issue rules and
152 regulations establishing time limits for permit
153 modifications and renewal of a permit for a solid waste
154 disposal area. The time limit shall be consistent with this
155 chapter.
156 (4) The applicant for a permit to construct a solid
157 waste processing facility shall provide the department with
158 plans, specifications and such other data as may be
159 necessary to comply with the purpose of sections 260.200 to

175 subsection, the applicant may maintain an action in the
176 circuit court of Cole County or that of the county in which
177 the facility is located or is to be sited. The court shall
178 order the department to show cause why it has not acted on
SB 1469 7
179 the permit and the court may, upon the presentation of
180 evidence satisfactory to the court, order the department to
181 issue or deny such permit or permit modification. Permits
182 for solid waste disposal areas, whether issued by the
183 department or ordered to be issued by a court, shall be for
184 the anticipated life of the facility.
185 (6) The applicant for a permit to construct a solid
186 waste processing facility shall pay an application fee of
187 one thousand dollars. Upon completion of the department's
188 evaluation of the application, but before receiving a
189 permit, the applicant shall reimburse the department for all
190 reasonable costs incurred by the department up to a maximum
191 of four thousand dollars. The applicant for a permit to
192 construct a solid waste disposal area shall pay an
193 application fee of two thousand dollars. Upon completion of
194 the department's evaluations of the application, but before
195 receiving a permit, the applicant shall reimburse the

197 department up to a maximum of eight thousand dollars.
198 Applicants who withdraw their application before the
199 department completes its evaluation shall be required to
200 reimburse the department for costs incurred in the
201 evaluation. The department shall not collect the fees
202 authorized in this subdivision unless it complies with the
203 time limits established in this section.
204 (7) When the review reveals that the facility or area
205 does conform with the provisions of sections 260.200 to
206 260.345 and the rules and regulations adopted pursuant to
207 sections 260.200 to 260.345, the department shall approve
208 the application and shall issue a permit for the
209 construction of each solid waste processing facility or
210 solid waste disposal area as set forth in the application
SB 1469 8
211 and with any permit terms and conditions which the
212 department deems appropriate. In the event that the
213 facility or area fails to meet the rules and regulations
214 adopted pursuant to sections 260.200 to 260.345, the
215 department shall issue a report to the applicant stating the
216 reason for denial of a permit.
217 6. Plans, designs, and relevant data for the
218 construction of solid waste processing facilities and solid
219 waste disposal areas shall be submitted to the department by
220 a registered professional engineer licensed by the state of
221 Missouri for approval prior to the construction, alteration
222 or operation of such a facility or area.
223 7. (1) Any person or operator as defined in section
224 260.200 who intends to obtain a construction permit in a
225 solid waste management district with an approved solid waste
226 management plan shall request a recommendation in support of
227 the application from the executive board created in section
228 260.315. The executive board shall consider the impact of
229 the proposal on, and the extent to which the proposal
230 conforms to, the approved district solid waste management
231 plan prepared pursuant to section 260.325. The executive
232 board shall act upon the request for a recommendation within
233 sixty days of receipt and shall submit a resolution to the
234 department specifying its position and its recommendation
235 regarding conformity of the application to the solid waste
236 plan. The board's failure to submit a resolution
237 constitutes recommendation of the application. The
238 department may consider the application, regardless of the
239 board's action thereon and may deny the construction permit
240 if the application fails to meet the requirements of
241 sections 260.200 to 260.345, or if the application is
SB 1469 9
242 inconsistent with the district's solid waste management
243 plan.
244 (2) Once approval of the detailed site investigation
245 has been granted by the department under subsection 4 of
246 this section, the permit process shall be held in abeyance
247 until the department has completed and published an update
248 of the statewide solid waste management plan required under
249 subdivision (4) of subsection 1 of section 260.225. This
250 subdivision shall apply only to applications that have not
251 received detailed site investigation approvals before August
252 28, 2024.
253 8. If the site proposed for a solid waste disposal
254 area is not owned by the applicant, the owner or owners of
255 the site shall acknowledge that an application pursuant to
256 sections 260.200 to 260.345 is to be submitted by signature
257 or signatures thereon. The department shall provide the
258 owner with copies of all communication with the operator,
259 including inspection reports and orders issued pursuant to
260 section 260.230.
261 9. The department shall not issue a permit for the
262 operation of a solid waste disposal area designed to serve a
263 city with a population of greater than four hundred thousand
264 located in more than one county, if the site is located
265 within one-half mile of an adjoining municipality, without
266 the approval of the governing body of such municipality.
267 The governing body shall conduct a public hearing within
268 fifteen days of notice, shall publicize the hearing in at
269 least one newspaper having general circulation in the
270 municipality, and shall vote to approve or disapprove the
271 land disposal facility within thirty days after the close of
272 the hearing.
SB 1469 10
273 10. (1) Upon receipt of an application for a permit
274 to construct a solid waste processing facility or disposal
275 area, the department shall notify the public of such receipt:
276 (a) By legal notice published in a newspaper of
277 general circulation in the area of the proposed disposal
278 area or processing facility;
279 (b) By certified mail to the governing body of the
280 county or city in which the proposed disposal area or
281 processing facility is to be located; and
282 (c) By mail to the last known address of all record
283 owners of contiguous real property or real property located
284 within one thousand feet of the proposed disposal area and,
285 for a proposed processing facility, notice as provided in
286 section 64.875 or section 89.060, whichever is applicable.
287 (2) If an application for a construction permit meets
288 all statutory and regulatory requirements for issuance, a
289 public hearing on the draft permit shall be held by the
290 department in the county in which the proposed solid waste
291 disposal area is to be located prior to the issuance of the
292 permit. The department shall provide public notice of such
293 hearing by both printed and broadcast media at least thirty
294 days prior to such hearing. Printed notification shall
295 include publication in at least one newspaper having general
296 circulation within the county in which the proposed disposal
297 area is to be located. Broadcast notification shall include
298 public service announcements on radio stations that have
299 broadcast coverage within the county in which the proposed
300 disposal area is to be located.
301 11. After the issuance of a construction permit for a
302 solid waste disposal area, but prior to the beginning of
303 disposal operations, the owner and the department shall
304 execute an easement to allow the department, its agents or
SB 1469 11
305 its contractors to enter the premises to complete work
306 specified in the closure plan, or to monitor or maintain the
307 site or to take remedial action during the postclosure
308 period. After issuance of a construction permit for a solid
309 waste disposal area, but prior to the beginning of disposal
310 operations, the owner shall submit evidence that such owner
311 has recorded, in the office of the recorder of deeds in the
312 county where the disposal area is located, a notice and
313 covenant running with the land that the property has been
314 permitted as a solid waste disposal area and prohibits use
315 of the land in any manner which interferes with the closure
316 and, where appropriate, postclosure plans filed with the
317 department.
318 12. Every person desiring to obtain a permit to
319 operate a solid waste disposal area or processing facility
320 shall submit applicable information and apply for an
321 operating permit from the department. The department shall
322 review the information and determine, within sixty days of
323 receipt, whether it complies with the provisions of sections
324 260.200 to 260.345 and the rules and regulations adopted
325 pursuant to sections 260.200 to 260.345. When the review
326 reveals that the facility or area does conform with the
327 provisions of sections 260.200 to 260.345 and the rules and
328 regulations adopted pursuant to sections 260.200 to 260.345,
329 the department shall issue a permit for the operation of
330 each solid waste processing facility or solid waste disposal
331 area and with any permit terms and conditions which the
332 department deems appropriate. In the event that the
333 facility or area fails to meet the rules and regulations
334 adopted pursuant to sections 260.200 to 260.345, the
335 department shall issue a report to the applicant stating the
336 reason for denial of a permit.
SB 1469 12
337 13. Each solid waste disposal area, except utility
338 waste landfills unless otherwise and to the extent required
339 by the department, and those solid waste processing
340 facilities designated by rule, shall be operated under the
341 direction of a certified solid waste technician in
342 accordance with sections 260.200 to 260.345 and the rules
343 and regulations promulgated pursuant to sections 260.200 to
344 260.345.
345 14. Base data for the quality and quantity of
346 groundwater in the solid waste disposal area shall be
347 collected and submitted to the department prior to the
348 operation of a new or expansion of an existing solid waste
349 disposal area. Base data shall include a chemical analysis
350 of groundwater drawn from the proposed solid waste disposal
351 area.
352 15. Leachate collection and removal systems shall be
353 incorporated into new or expanded sanitary landfills which
354 are permitted after August 13, 1986. The department shall
355 assess the need for a leachate collection system for all
356 types of solid waste disposal areas, other than sanitary
357 landfills, and the need for monitoring wells when it
358 evaluates the application for all new or expanded solid
359 waste disposal areas. The department may require an
360 operator of a solid waste disposal area to install a
361 leachate collection system before the beginning of disposal
362 operations, at any time during disposal operations for
363 unfilled portions of the area, or for any portion of the
364 disposal area as a part of a remedial plan. The department
365 may require the operator to install monitoring wells before
366 the beginning of disposal operations or at any time during
367 the operational life or postclosure care period if it
368 concludes that conditions at the area warrant such
SB 1469 13
369 monitoring. The operator of a demolition landfill or
370 utility waste landfill shall not be required to install a
371 leachate collection and removal system or monitoring wells
372 unless otherwise and to the extent the department so
373 requires based on hazardous waste characteristic criteria or
374 site specific geohydrological characteristics or conditions.
375 16. Permits granted by the department, as provided in
376 sections 260.200 to 260.345, shall be subject to suspension
377 for a designated period of time, civil penalty or revocation
378 whenever the department determines that the solid waste
379 processing facility or solid waste disposal area is, or has
380 been, operated in violation of sections 260.200 to 260.345
381 or the rules or regulations adopted pursuant to sections
382 260.200 to 260.345, or has been operated in violation of any
383 permit terms and conditions, or is creating a public
384 nuisance, health hazard, or environmental pollution. In the
385 event a permit is suspended or revoked, the person named in
386 the permit shall be fully informed as to the reasons for
387 such action.
388 17. Each permit for operation of a facility or area
389 shall be issued only to the person named in the
390 application. Permits are transferable as a modification to
391 the permit. An application to transfer ownership shall
392 identify the proposed permittee. A disclosure statement for
393 the proposed permittee listing violations contained in the
394 definition of disclosure statement found in section 260.200
395 shall be submitted to the department. The operation and
396 design plans for the facility or area shall be updated to
397 provide compliance with the currently applicable law and
398 rules. A financial assurance instrument in such an amount
399 and form as prescribed by the department shall be provided
400 for solid waste disposal areas by the proposed permittee
SB 1469 14
401 prior to transfer of the permit. The financial assurance
402 instrument of the original permittee shall not be released
403 until the new permittee's financial assurance instrument has
404 been approved by the department and the transfer of
405 ownership is complete.
406 18. Those solid waste disposal areas permitted on
407 January 1, 1996, shall, upon submission of a request for
408 permit modification, be granted a solid waste management
409 area operating permit if the request meets reasonable
410 requirements set out by the department.
411 19. In case a permit required pursuant to this section
412 is denied or revoked, the person may request a hearing in
413 accordance with section 260.235.
414 20. Every applicant for a permit shall file a
415 disclosure statement with the information required by and on
416 a form developed by the department of natural resources at
417 the same time the application for a permit is filed with the
418 department.
419 21. Upon request of the director of the department of
420 natural resources, the applicant for a permit, any person
421 that could reasonably be expected to be involved in
422 management activities of the solid waste disposal area or
423 solid waste processing facility, or any person who has a
424 controlling interest in any permittee shall be required to
425 submit to a criminal background check under section 43.543.
426 22. All persons required to file a disclosure
427 statement shall provide any assistance or information
428 requested by the director or by the Missouri state highway
429 patrol and shall cooperate in any inquiry or investigation
430 conducted by the department and any inquiry, investigation
431 or hearing conducted by the director. If, upon issuance of
432 a formal request to answer any inquiry or produce
SB 1469 15
433 information, evidence or testimony, any person required to
434 file a disclosure statement refuses to comply, the
435 application of an applicant or the permit of a permittee may
436 be denied or revoked by the director.
437 23. If any of the information required to be included
438 in the disclosure statement changes, or if any additional
439 information should be added after the filing of the
440 statement, the person required to file it shall provide that
441 information to the director in writing, within thirty days
442 after the change or addition. The failure to provide such
443 information within thirty days may constitute the basis for
444 the revocation of or denial of an application for any permit
445 issued or applied for in accordance with this section, but
446 only if, prior to any such denial or revocation, the
447 director notifies the applicant or permittee of the
448 director's intention to do so and gives the applicant or
449 permittee fourteen days from the date of the notice to
450 explain why the information was not provided within the
451 required thirty-day period. The director shall consider
452 this information when determining whether to revoke, deny or
453 conditionally grant the permit.
454 24. No person shall be required to submit the
455 disclosure statement required by this section if the person
456 is a corporation or an officer, director or shareholder of
457 that corporation or any subsidiary thereof, and that
458 corporation:
459 (1) Has on file and in effect with the federal
460 Securities and Exchange Commission a registration statement
461 required under Section 5, Chapter 38, Title 1 of the
462 Securities Act of 1933, as amended, 15 U.S.C. Section 77e(c);
463 (2) Submits to the director with the application for a
464 permit evidence of the registration described in subdivision
SB 1469 16
465 (1) of this subsection and a copy of the corporation's most
466 recent annual form 10-K or an equivalent report; and
467 (3) Submits to the director on the anniversary date of
468 the issuance of any permit it holds under the Missouri solid
469 waste management law evidence of registration described in
470 subdivision (1) of this subsection and a copy of the
471 corporation's most recent annual form 10-K or an equivalent
472 report.
473 25. After permit issuance, each facility shall
474 annually file an update to the disclosure statement with the
475 department of natural resources on or before March thirty-
476 first of each year. Failure to provide such update may
477 result in penalties as provided for under section 260.240.
478 26. Any county, district, municipality, authority, or
479 other political subdivision of this state which owns and
480 operates a sanitary landfill shall be exempt from the
