52 (1) A refusal to permit, at the expense of the person
53 with the disability, reasonable modifications of existing

95 physical disabilities, commonly cited as "ANSI A117.1",
96 suffices to satisfy the requirements of paragraph (a) of
97 subdivision (3) of subsection 2 of this section.
98 5. Where a unit of general local government has
99 incorporated into its laws the requirements set forth in

103 the following provisions:
104 (1) A unit of general local government may review and
105 approve newly constructed covered multifamily dwellings for

107 design and construction requirements of subdivision (3) of
108 subsection 2 of this section are met;
109 (2) The commission shall encourage, but may not
110 require, the units of local government to include in their
111 existing procedures for the review and approval of newly
112 constructed covered multifamily dwellings, determinations as
113 to whether the design and construction of such dwellings are
114 consistent with subdivision (3) of subsection 2 of this
115 section, and shall provide technical assistance to units of
116 local government and other persons to implement the
117 requirements of subdivision (3) of subsection 2 of this
118 section;
119 (3) Nothing in this chapter shall be construed to
120 require the commission to review or approve the plans,
121 designs or construction of all covered dwellings, to
122 determine whether the design and construction of such
123 dwellings are consistent with the requirements of
124 subdivision (3) of subsection 2 of this section.
125 6. Nothing in this chapter shall be construed to
126 invalidate or limit any law of the state or political
127 subdivision of the state, or other jurisdiction in which
128 this chapter shall be effective, that requires dwellings to
129 be designed and constructed in a manner that affords persons
130 with disabilities greater access than is required by this
131 chapter.
132 7. Nothing in this section and sections 213.045 and
133 213.050 requires that a dwelling be made available to an
134 individual whose tenancy would constitute a direct threat to
135 the health or safety of other individuals or whose tenancy
136 would result in substantial physical damage to the property
137 of others.
SB 787 14
138 8. Nothing in this section and sections 213.045 and
139 213.050 limits the applicability of any reasonable local or
140 state restriction regarding the maximum number of occupants
141 permitted to occupy a dwelling, nor does any provision in
142 this section and sections 213.045 and 213.050 regarding
143 familial status apply with respect to housing for older
144 persons.
145 9. As used in this section and sections 213.045 and
146 213.050, "housing for older persons" means housing:
147 (1) Provided under any state or federal program that
148 the commission determines is specifically designed and
149 operated to assist elderly persons, as defined in the state
150 or federal program;
151 (2) Intended for, and solely occupied by, persons
152 sixty-two years of age or older; or
153 (3) Intended and operated for occupancy by at least
154 one person fifty-five years of age or older per unit. In
155 determining whether housing qualifies as housing for older
156 persons under this subsection, the commission shall develop
157 regulations which require at least the following factors:
158 (a) The existence of significant facilities and
159 services specifically designed to meet the physical or
160 social needs of older persons, or if the provision of such
161 facilities and services is not practicable, that such
162 housing is necessary to provide important housing
163 opportunities for older persons; and

165 occupied by at least one person fifty-five years of age or
166 older per unit; and

169 manager to provide housing for persons fifty-five years of
170 age or older.
171 10. Housing shall not fail to meet the requirements
172 for housing for older persons by reason of:
173 (1) Persons residing in such housing as of August 28,
174 1992, who do not meet the age requirements of subdivision
175 (2) or (3) of subsection 9 of this section, provided that
176 new occupants of such housing meet the age requirements of
177 subdivision (2) or (3) of subsection 9 of this section; or
178 (2) Unoccupied units, provided that such units are
179 reserved for occupancy by persons who meet the age
180 requirements of subdivision (2) or (3) of subsection 9 of
181 this section.
182 11. Nothing in this section or section 213.045 or
183 213.050 shall prohibit conduct against a person because such
184 person has been convicted by any court of competent
185 jurisdiction of the illegal manufacture or distribution of a
186 controlled substance, as defined by section 195.010.
187 12. Nothing in this chapter shall prohibit a religious
188 organization, association, or society, or any nonprofit
189 institution or organization operated, supervised or
190 controlled by or in conjunction with a religious
191 organization, association, or society, from limiting the
192 sale, rental or occupancy of dwellings which it owns or
193 operates for other than a commercial purpose to persons of
194 the same religion, or from giving preference to such
195 persons, unless membership in such religion is restricted on
196 account of race, color, or national origin. Nor shall
197 anything in this chapter prohibit a private club not in fact
198 open to the public, which as an incident to its primary
199 purpose or purposes provides lodging which it owns or
200 operates for other than a commercial purpose, from limiting
SB 787 16
201 the rental or occupancy of such lodging to its members or
202 from giving preference to its members.
203 13. Nothing in this chapter, other than the
204 prohibitions against discriminatory advertising in
205 subdivision (3) of subsection 1 of this section, shall apply
206 to:
207 (1) The sale or rental of any single family house by a
208 private individual owner, provided the following conditions
209 are met:
210 (a) The private individual owner does not own or have
211 any interest in more than three single family houses at any
212 one time; and
213 (b) The house is sold or rented without the use of a
214 real estate broker, agent or salesperson or the facilities
215 of any person in the business of selling or renting
216 dwellings and without publication, posting or mailing of any
217 advertisement. If the owner selling the house does not
218 reside in it at the time of the sale or was not the most
219 recent resident of the house prior to such sale, the
220 exemption in this section applies to only one such sale in
221 any twenty-four-month period; or
222 (2) Rooms or units in dwellings containing living
223 quarters occupied or intended to be occupied by no more than
