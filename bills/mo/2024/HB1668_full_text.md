AN ACT
To repeal section 137.073, RSMo, and to enact in lieu thereof one new section relating to the
inflationary growth factor for assessment growth.
Be it enacted by the General Assembly of the state of Missouri, as follows:
Section A. Section 137.073, RSMo, is repealed and one new section enacted in lieu
2 thereof, to be known as section 137.073, to read as follows:
137.073. 1. As used in this section, the following terms mean:
2 (1) "General reassessment", changes in value, entered in the assessor's books, of a
3 substantial portion of the parcels of real property within a county resulting wholly or partly
4 from reappraisal of value or other actions of the assessor or county equalization body or
5 ordered by the state tax commission or any court;
6 (2) "Tax rate", "rate", or "rate of levy", singular or plural, includes the tax rate for
7 each purpose of taxation of property a taxing authority is authorized to levy without a vote
8 and any tax rate authorized by election, including bond interest and sinking fund;
9 (3) "Tax rate ceiling", a tax rate as revised by the taxing authority to comply with the
10 provisions of this section or when a court has determined the tax rate; except that, other
11 provisions of law to the contrary notwithstanding, a school district may levy the operating
12 levy for school purposes required for the current year pursuant to subsection 2 of section
13 163.021, less all adjustments required pursuant to Article X, Section 22 of the Missouri
14 Constitution, if such tax rate does not exceed the highest tax rate in effect subsequent to the
15 1980 tax year. This is the maximum tax rate that may be levied, unless a higher tax rate
16 ceiling is approved by voters of the political subdivision as provided in this section;
EXPLANATION — Matter enclosed in bold-faced brackets [thus] in the above bill is not enacted and is

HB 1668 2
17 (4) "Taxrevenue",whenreferringtothepreviousyear,meanstheactualreceiptsfrom
18 ad valorem levies on all classes of property, including state-assessed property, in the
19 immediately preceding fiscal year of the political subdivision, plus an allowance for taxes
20 billed but not collected in the fiscal year and plus an additional allowance for the revenue
21 which would have been collected from property which was annexed by such political
22 subdivision but which was not previously used in determining tax revenue pursuant to this
23 section. The term "tax revenue" shall not include any receipts from ad valorem levies on any
24 property of a railroad corporation or a public utility, as these terms are defined in section
25 386.020, which were assessed by the assessor of a county or city in the previous year but are
26 assessed by the state tax commission in the current year. All school districts and those
27 counties levying sales taxes pursuant to chapter 67 shall include in the calculation of tax
28 revenue an amount equivalent to that by which they reduced property tax levies as a result of
29 sales tax pursuant to section 67.505 and section 164.013 [or as excess home dock city or
30 county fees as provided in subsection 4 of section 313.820] in the immediately preceding
31 fiscal year but not including any amount calculated to adjust for prior years. For purposes of
32 political subdivisions which were authorized to levy a tax in the prior year but which did not
33 levy such tax or levied a reduced rate, the term "tax revenue", as used in relation to the
34 revision of tax levies mandated by law, shall mean the revenues equal to the amount that
35 would have been available if the voluntary rate reduction had not been made.
36 2. (1) Whenever changes in assessed valuation are entered in the assessor's books for
37 anypersonalproperty,intheaggregate,orforanysubclassofrealpropertyassuchsubclasses
38 are established in Section 4(b) of Article X of the Missouri Constitution and defined in
39 section137.016,thecountyclerkinallcountiesandthe assessorofSt.LouisCityshallnotify
40 eachpoliticalsubdivisionwhollyorpartiallywithinthecountyorSt.LouisCityofthechange
41 in valuation of each subclass of real property, individually, and personal property, in the
42 aggregate, exclusive of new construction and improvements. All political subdivisions shall
43 immediately revise the applicable rates of levy for each purpose for each subclass of real
44 property, individually, and personal property, in the aggregate, for which taxes are levied to
45 the extent necessary to produce from all taxable property, exclusive of new construction and
46 improvements, substantially the same amount of tax revenue as was produced in the previous
47 year for each subclass of real property, individually, and personal property, in the aggregate,
48 except that the rate shall not exceed the greater of the most recent voter-approved rate or the
49 most recent voter-approved rate as adjusted under subdivision (2) of subsection 5 of this
50 section.
51 (2) Any political subdivisionthat hasreceived approvalfrom votersfor a tax increase
52 afterAugust27,2008,maylevyaratetocollectsubstantiallythesameamountoftaxrevenue
53 as the amount of revenue that would have been derived by applying the voter-approved
HB 1668 3
54 increased tax rate ceiling to the total assessed valuation of the political subdivision as most
55 recently certified by the city or county clerk on or before the date of the election in which
56 such increase is approved, increased by the percentage increase in the consumer price index,
57 as provided by law, except that the rate shall not exceed the greater of the most recent voter-
58 approved rate or the most recent voter-approved rate as adjusted under subdivision (2) of
59 subsection 5 of this section. Such tax revenue shall not include any receipts from ad valorem
60 levies on any real property which was assessed by the assessor of a county or city in such
61 previous year but is assessed by the assessor of a county or city in the current year in a
62 different subclass of real property.
63 (3) Where the taxing authority is a school district for the purposes of revising the
64 applicable rates of levy for each subclass of real property, the tax revenues from state-
65 assessed railroad and utility property shall be apportioned and attributed to each subclass of
66 real property based on the percentage of the total assessed valuation of the county that each
67 subclass of real property represents in the current taxable year.
68 (4) As provided in Section 22 of Article X of the constitution, a political subdivision
69 may also revise each levy to allow for inflationary assessment growth occurring within the
70 political subdivision. The inflationary growth factor for any such subclass of real property or
71 personal property shall be limited to the actual assessment growth in such subclass or class,
72 exclusive of new construction and improvements, and exclusive of the assessed value on any
73 real property which was assessed by the assessor of a county or city in the current year in a
74 different subclass of real property, but not to exceed the [consumer price index or five
75 percent, whichever is] lower of the following:
76 (a) The consumer price index; or
77 (b) The following percentage:
78 a. For revisions under this subsection occurring before January 1, 2025, five
79 percent; or
80 b. For revisions under this subsection occurring on or after January 1, 2025,
81 three percent.
82 (5) Should the tax revenue of a political subdivision from the various tax rates
83 determined in this subsection be different than the tax revenue that would have been
84 determined from a single tax rate as calculated pursuant to the method of calculation in this
85 subsection prior to January 1, 2003, then the political subdivision shall revise the tax rates of
86 those subclasses of real property, individually, and/or personal property, in the aggregate, in
87 which there is a tax rate reduction, pursuant to the provisions of this subsection. Such
88 revision shall yield an amount equal to such difference and shall be apportioned among such
89 subclasses of real property, individually, and/or personal property, in the aggregate, based on
90 the relative assessed valuation of the class or subclasses of property experiencing a tax rate
HB 1668 4
91 reduction. Suchrevisioninthetaxratesofeachclassorsubclassshallbemadebycomputing
92 the percentage of current year adjusted assessed valuation of each class or subclass with a tax
93 rate reduction to the total current year adjusted assessed valuation of the class or subclasses
94 with a tax rate reduction, multiplying the resulting percentages by the revenue difference
95 between the single rate calculation and the calculations pursuant to this subsection and
96 dividingbytherespectiveadjustedcurrentyearassessedvaluationofeachclassorsubclassto
97 determine the adjustment to the rate to be levied upon each class or subclass of property. The
98 adjustment computed herein shall be multiplied by one hundred, rounded to four decimals in
99 the manner provided in this subsection, and added to the initial rate computed for each class
100 or subclass of property.
101 (6) For school districts that levy separate tax rates on each subclass of real property
102 andpersonalpropertyintheaggregate,ifvotersapprovedaballotbeforeJanuary1,2011,that
103 presentedseparatestatedtaxratestobeappliedtothedifferentsubclassesofrealpropertyand
104 personal property in the aggregate, or increases the separate rates that may be levied on the
105 different subclasses of real property and personal property in the aggregate by different
106 amounts, the tax rate that shall be used for the single tax rate calculation shall be a blended
107 rate, calculated in the manner provided under subdivision (1) of subsection 6 of this section.
108 (7) Notwithstanding any provision of this subsection to the contrary, no revision to
109 the rate of levy for personal property shall cause such levy to increase over the levy for
110 personal property from the prior year.
111 3. (1) Where the taxing authority is a school district, it shall be required to revise the
112 rates of levy to the extent necessary to produce from all taxable property, including state-
113 assessed railroad and utility property, which shall be separately estimated in addition to other
114 data required in complying with section 164.011, substantially the amount of tax revenue
115 permitted in this section. In the year following tax rate reduction, the tax rate ceiling may be
116 adjusted to offset such district's reduction in the apportionment of state school moneys due to
117 itsreduced taxrate. However, inthe eventanyschool district,in calculatinga taxrateceiling
118 pursuant to this section, requiring the estimating of effects of state-assessed railroad and
119 utility valuation or loss of state aid, discovers that the estimates used result in receipt of
120 excess revenues, which would have required a lower rate if the actual information had been
121 known,theschooldistrictshallreducethetaxrateceilinginthefollowingyeartocompensate
122 forthe excess receipts,and the recalculatedrateshall become thetax rateceiling for purposes
123 of this section.
124 (2) For any political subdivision which experiences a reduction in the amount of
125 assessed valuation relating to a prior year, due to decisions of the state tax commission or a
126 court pursuant to sections 138.430 to 138.433, or due to clerical errors or corrections in the
127 calculation or recordation of any assessed valuation:
HB 1668 5
128 (a) Suchpoliticalsubdivisionmayrevisethetaxrateceilingforeachpurposeitlevies
129 taxes to compensate for the reduction in assessed value occurring after the political
130 subdivision calculated the tax rate ceiling for the particular subclass of real property or for
131 personal property, in the aggregate, in a prior year. Such revision by the political subdivision
132 shall be made at the time of the next calculation of the tax rate for the particular subclass of
133 real property or for personal property, in the aggregate, after the reduction in assessed
134 valuation has been determined and shall be calculated in a manner that results in the revised
135 taxrateceilingbeingthesameasitwouldhavebeenhadthecorrectedorfinalizedassessment
136 been available at the time of the prior calculation;
137 (b) In addition, for up to three years following the determination of the reduction in
138 assessed valuation as a result of circumstances defined in this subdivision, such political
139 subdivision may levy a tax rate for each purpose it levies taxes above the revised tax rate
140 ceiling provided in paragraph (a) of this subdivision to recoup any revenues it was entitled to
141 receive had the corrected or finalized assessment been available at the time of the prior
142 calculation.
143 4. (1) InordertoimplementtheprovisionsofthissectionandSection22ofArticleX
144 of the Constitution of Missouri, the term improvements shall apply to both real and personal
145 property. Inordertodeterminethevalueofnewconstructionandimprovements,eachcounty
146 assessor shall maintain a record of real property valuations in such a manner as to identify
147 each year the increase in valuation for each political subdivision in the county as a result of
148 new construction and improvements. The value of new construction and improvements shall
149 include the additional assessed value of all improvements or additions to real property which
150 were begun after and were not part of the prior year's assessment, except that the additional
151 assessed value of all improvements or additions to real property which had been totally or
152 partially exempt from ad valorem taxes pursuant to sections 99.800 to 99.865, sections
153 135.200 to 135.255, and section 353.110 shall be included in the value of new construction
154 and improvements when the property becomes totally or partially subject to assessment and
155 paymentofalladvaloremtaxes. Theaggregateincreaseinvaluationofpersonalpropertyfor
156 the current year over that of the previous year is the equivalent of the new construction and
157 improvements factor for personal property. Notwithstanding any opt-out implemented
158 pursuant to subsection 14 of section 137.115, the assessor shall certify the amount of new
159 construction and improvements and the amount of assessed value on any real property which
160 was assessed by the assessor of a county or city in such previous year but is assessed by the
161 assessor of a county or city in the current year in a different subclass of real property
162 separatelyforeachofthethreesubclassesofrealpropertyforeachpoliticalsubdivisiontothe
163 county clerk in order that political subdivisions shall have this information for the purpose of
164 calculating tax rates pursuant to this section and Section 22, Article X, Constitution of
HB 1668 6
165 Missouri. In addition, the state tax commission shall certify each year to each county clerk
166 theincreaseinthegeneralpricelevelasmeasuredbytheConsumerPriceIndexforAllUrban
167 Consumers for the United States, or its successor publications, as defined and officially
168 reported by the United States Department of Labor, or its successor agency. The state tax
169 commission shall certify the increase in such index on the latest twelve-month basis available
170 on February first of each year over the immediately preceding prior twelve-month period in
171 order that political subdivisions shall have this information available in setting their tax rates
172 accordingtolawandSection22ofArticleXoftheConstitutionofMissouri. Forpurposesof
173 implementing the provisions of this section and Section 22 of Article X of the Missouri
174 Constitution, the term "property" means all taxable property, including state-assessed
175 property.
176 (2) Each political subdivision required to revise rates of levy pursuant to this section
177 or Section 22 of Article X of the Constitution of Missouri shall calculate each tax rate it is
178 authorized to levy and, in establishing each tax rate, shall consider each provision for tax rate
179 revision provided in this section and Section 22 of Article X of the Constitution of Missouri,
180 separately and without regard to annual tax rate reductions provided in section 67.505 and
181 section 164.013. Each political subdivision shall set each tax rate it is authorized to levy
182 using the calculation that produces the lowest tax rate ceiling. It is further the intent of the
183 general assembly, pursuant to the authority of Section 10(c) of Article X of the Constitution
184 of Missouri, that the provisions of such section be applicable to tax rate revisions mandated
185 pursuant to Section 22 of Article X of the Constitution of Missouri as to reestablishing tax
186 rates as revised in subsequent years, enforcement provisions, and other provisions not in
187 conflict with Section 22 of Article X of the Constitution of Missouri. Annual tax rate
188 reductions provided in section 67.505 and section 164.013 shall be applied to the tax rate as
189 established pursuant to this section and Section 22 of Article X of the Constitution of
190 Missouri, unless otherwise provided by law.
191 5. (1) In all political subdivisions, the tax rate ceiling established pursuant to this
192 sectionshallnotbeincreasedunlessapprovedbyavoteofthepeople. Approvalofthehigher
193 tax rate shall be by at least a majorityof votes cast. When a proposed higher tax rate requires
194 approval by more than a simple majority pursuant to any provision of law or the constitution,
195 the tax rate increase must receive approval by at least the majority required.
196 (2) When voters approve an increase in the tax rate, the amount of the increase shall
197 beaddedtothetaxrateceilingascalculatedpursuanttothissectiontotheextentthetotalrate
198 does not exceed any maximum rate prescribed by law. If a ballot question presents a stated
199 tax rate for approval rather than describing the amount of increase in the question, the stated
200 tax rate approved shall be adjusted as provided in this section and, so adjusted, shall be the
201 current tax rate ceiling. The increased tax rate ceiling as approved shall be adjusted such that
HB 1668 7
202 when applied to the current total assessed valuation of the political subdivision, excluding
203 new construction and improvements since the date of the election approving such increase,
204 the revenue derived from the adjusted tax rate ceiling is equal to the sum of: the amount of
205 revenue which would have been derived by applying the voter-approved increased tax rate
206 ceilingtototalassessedvaluationofthepoliticalsubdivision,asmostrecentlycertifiedbythe
207 city or county clerk on or before the date of the election in which such increase is approved,
208 increased by the percentage increase in the consumer price index, as provided by law. Such
209 adjusted tax rate ceiling may be applied to the total assessed valuation of the political
210 subdivisionatthesettingofthenexttaxrate. Ifaballotquestionpresentsaphased-intaxrate
211 increase, upon voter approval, each tax rate increase shall be adjusted in the manner
212 prescribedinthissectiontoyieldthesumof: theamountofrevenuethatwouldbederivedby
213 applying such voter-approved increased rate to the total assessed valuation, as most recently
214 certified by the city or county clerk on or before the date of the election in which such
215 increase was approved, increased by the percentage increase in the consumer price index, as
216 provided by law, from the date of the election to the time of such increase and, so adjusted,
217 shall be the current tax rate ceiling.
218 (3) Thegoverning bodyofany political subdivisionmaylevy a taxrate lower thanits
219 tax rate ceiling and may, in a nonreassessment year, increase that lowered tax rate to a level
220 not exceeding the tax rate ceiling without voter approval in the manner provided under
221 subdivision (4) of this subsection. Nothing in this section shall be construed as prohibiting a
222 political subdivision from voluntarily levying a tax rate lower than that which is required
223 under the provisions of this section or from seeking voter approval of a reduction to such
224 political subdivision's tax rate ceiling.
225 (4) In a year of general reassessment, a governing body whose tax rate is lower than
226 its tax rate ceiling shall revise its tax rate pursuant to the provisions of subsection 4 of this
227 sectionasifitstaxratewasatthetaxrateceiling. Inayearfollowinggeneralreassessment,if
228 such governing body intends to increase its tax rate, the governing body shall conduct a
229 public hearing, and in a public meeting it shall adopt an ordinance, resolution, or policy
230 statementjustifyingitsactionpriortosettingandcertifyingitstaxrate. Theprovisionsofthis
231 subdivision shall not apply to any political subdivision which levies a tax rate lower than its
232 tax rate ceiling solely due to a reduction required by law resulting from sales tax collections.
233 The provisions of this subdivision shall not apply to any political subdivision which has
234 received voter approval for an increase to its tax rate ceiling subsequent to setting its most
235 recent tax rate.
236 6. (1) For the purposes of calculating state aid for public schools pursuant to section
237 163.031, each taxing authority which is a school district shall determine its proposed tax rate
238 as a blended rate of the classes or subclasses of property. Such blended rate shall be
HB 1668 8
239 calculated by first determining the total tax revenue of the property within the jurisdiction of
240 the taxing authority, which amount shall be equal to the sum of the products of multiplying
241 theassessedvaluationofeachclass andsubclassofpropertybythecorresponding taxratefor
242 such class or subclass, then dividing the total tax revenue by the total assessed valuation of
243 the same jurisdiction, and then multiplying the resulting quotient by a factor of one hundred.
244 Where the taxing authority is a school district, such blended rate shall also be used by such
245 school district for calculating revenue from state-assessed railroad and utility property as
246 defined in chapter 151 and for apportioning the tax rate by purpose.
247 (2) Eachtaxingauthorityproposingtolevyataxrateinanyyearshallnotifytheclerk

266 the following year's payments. The county clerk shall keep on file and available for public
267 inspection all such information for a period of three years. The clerk shall, within three days
268 of receipt, forward a copy of the notice of a taxing authority's tax rate ceiling and proposed
269 tax rate and any substantiating data to the state auditor. The state auditor shall, within fifteen
270 days of the date of receipt, examine such information and return to the county clerk his or her
271 findings as to compliance of the tax rate ceiling with this section and as to compliance of any
272 proposedtaxratefordebtservicewithMissourilaw. Ifthestateauditorbelievesthatataxing
273 authority's proposed tax rate does not comply with Missouri law, then the state auditor's
274 findings shall include a recalculated tax rate, and the state auditor may request a taxing
275 authority to submit documentation supporting such taxing authority's proposed tax rate. The

283 rejects a rate change certified by the state auditor and the state auditor does not receive
284 supporting information which justifies the taxing authority's original or any subsequent
285 proposed tax rate, then the state auditor shall refer the perceived violations of such taxing
286 authority to the attorney general's office and the attorney general is authorized to obtain
287 injunctive relief to prevent the taxing authority from levying a violative tax rate.
288 (3) In the event that the taxing authority incorrectly completes the forms created and
289 promulgated under subdivision (2) of this subsection, or makes a clerical error, the taxing
290 authority may submit amended forms with an explanation for the needed changes. If such
291 amended forms are filed under regulations prescribed by the state auditor, the state auditor
292 shall take into consideration such amended forms for the purposes of this subsection.

294 subdivision has complied with the foregoing provisions of this section.
295 8. Whenever a taxpayer has cause to believe that a taxing authority has not complied
296 with the provisions of this section, the taxpayer may make a formal complaint with the
297 prosecuting attorney of the county. Where the prosecuting attorney fails to bring an action
298 withintendaysofthefilingofthecomplaint,thetaxpayermaybringacivilactionpursuantto
299 this section and institute an action as representative of a class of all taxpayers within a taxing
300 authority if the class is so numerous that joinder of all members is impracticable, if there are
301 questions of law or fact common to the class, if the claims or defenses of the representative
302 parties are typical of the claims or defenses of the class, and if the representative parties will
303 fairly and adequately protect the interests of the class. In any class action maintained
304 pursuant to this section, the court may direct to the members of the class a notice to be
305 published at least once each week for four consecutive weeks in a newspaper of general
306 circulation published in the county where the civil action is commenced and in other counties
307 within the jurisdiction of a taxing authority. The notice shall advise each member that the
308 court will exclude him or her from the class if he or she so requests by a specified date, that
309 the judgment, whether favorable or not, will include all members who do not request
310 exclusion, and that any member who does not request exclusion may, if he or she desires,
311 enter an appearance. In any class action brought pursuant to this section, the court, in
312 addition to the relief requested, shall assess against the taxing authority found to be in
HB 1668 10
313 violation of this section the reasonable costs of bringing the action, including reasonable
314 attorney's fees, provided no attorney's fees shall be awarded any attorney or association of
315 attorneys who receive public funds from any source for their services. Any action brought

324 difference in the amount produced by the original levy and the amount produced by the
325 revised levy. The township or county collector of taxes or the collector of taxes in any city
326 shall refund the amount of the tax erroneously paid. The taxing authority refusing to revise
327 the rate of levy as provided in this section shall make available to the collector all funds
328 necessary to make refunds pursuant to this subsection. No taxpayer shall receive any interest
