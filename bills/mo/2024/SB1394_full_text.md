191 to the certificate holder's hours in the classroom, if the
192 certificate holder is employed less than full time; and

208 Should the possessor of a valid career continuous

211 possessor may, within two years, make up the missing hours.
212 In order to make up for missing hours, the possessor shall
213 first complete the fifteen-hour requirement for the current
214 year and then may count hours in excess of the current year
215 requirement as make-up hours. Should the possessor fail to
216 make up the missing hours within two years, the certificate
217 shall become inactive. In order to reactivate the
218 certificate, the possessor shall complete twenty-four
219 contact hours of professional development which may include
220 hours spent in the classroom in an appropriate college
221 curriculum within the six months prior to or after
222 reactivating the possessor's certificate. The requirements
223 of this paragraph shall be monitored and verified by the
224 local school district which employs the holder of the career
225 continuous professional certificate.
226 (c) A holder of a career continuous professional
227 certificate shall be exempt from the professional
228 development contact hour requirements of paragraph (b) of

239 force may retain the current level of certification. There
240 shall also be established policies and procedures allowing a
241 teacher who has not been employed in an educational position
242 for three years or more to reactivate the teacher's last
243 level of certification by completing twenty-four contact
244 hours of professional development which may include hours
245 spent in the classroom in an appropriate college curriculum
246 within the six months prior to or after reactivating the
247 teacher's certificate.
248 5. The state board shall, upon completion of a
249 background check as prescribed in section 168.133, issue a
250 professional certificate classification in the areas most
251 closely aligned with an applicant's current areas of
252 certification, commensurate with the years of teaching
253 experience of the applicant, to any person who is hired to
254 teach in a public school in this state and who possesses a
255 valid teaching certificate from another state or
256 certification under subdivision (4) of subsection 1 of this
257 section, provided that the certificate holder shall annually
258 complete the state board's requirements for such level of
259 certification, and shall establish policies by which
260 residents of states other than the state of Missouri may be
261 assessed a fee for a certificate of license to teach in the
262 public schools of Missouri. Such fee shall be in an amount
263 sufficient to recover any or all costs associated with the
264 issuing of a certificate of license to teach. The board
265 shall promulgate rules to authorize the issuance of a
266 provisional certificate of license, which shall be valid for
267 three years and shall allow the holder to assume classroom
268 duties pending the completion of a criminal background check
269 under section 168.133, for any applicant who:
SB 1394 10
270 (1) Is the spouse of a member of the Armed Forces
271 stationed in Missouri;
272 (2) Relocated from another state within one year of
273 the date of application;
274 (3) Underwent a criminal background check in order to
275 be issued a teaching certificate of license from another

278 6. The state board may assess to holders of an initial
279 professional certificate a fee, to be deposited into the
280 excellence in education fund established pursuant to section
281 160.268, for the issuance of the career continuous
282 professional certificate. However, such fee shall not
283 exceed the combined costs of issuance and any criminal
284 background check required as a condition of issuance.
285 Applicants for the initial ABCTE certificate shall be
286 responsible for any fees associated with the program leading
287 to the issuance of the certificate, but nothing in this
288 section shall prohibit a district from developing a policy
289 that permits fee reimbursement.
290 7. Any member of the public school retirement system
291 of Missouri who entered covered employment with ten or more
292 years of educational experience in another state or states
293 and held a certificate issued by another state and
294 subsequently worked in a school district covered by the
295 public school retirement system of Missouri for ten or more
296 years who later became certificated in Missouri shall have
297 that certificate dated back to the member's original date of
298 employment in a Missouri public school.
299 8. Within thirty days of receiving an application from
300 a spouse of an active duty member of the Armed Forces of the
301 United States who has been transferred or is scheduled to be
SB 1394 11
302 transferred to the state of Missouri, or who has been
303 transferred or is scheduled to be transferred to an adjacent
304 state and is or will be domiciled in the state of Missouri,

309 such applicant a full certificate of license to teach,
310 provided that the applicant has paid all necessary fees and
311 has otherwise met all requirements to be issued such a
312 certificate.
