AN ACT
To amend chapter 163, RSMo, by adding thereto one new section relating to school districts' local
effort figures.
Be it enacted by the General Assembly of the State of Missouri, as follows:
1 Section A. Chapter 163, RSMo, is amended by adding thereto
2 one new section, to be known as section 163.096, to read as
3 follows:
1 163.096. For any school district that, during fiscal
2 year 2005, recorded revenues from intangible taxes, the
3 merchants' and manufacturers' surcharge, and payments in
4 lieu of taxes other than tax increment financing surplus to
5 the district's teacher and incidental funds and, as a
6 result, caused an elevation of the district's "local effort"
7 figure, as the term "local effort" is defined in section
8 163.011, the department of elementary and secondary
9 education shall calculate the amount of state aid the
10 district would have received had the district placed such
11 revenues in its capital projects fund or debt service fund.
12 The department shall use this revised local effort figure
13 for all state aid payments subsequent to August 28, 2024.
