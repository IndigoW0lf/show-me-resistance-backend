To repeal section 161.670, RSMo, and to enact in lieu thereof one new section relating to the
virtual school program.
Be it enacted by the General Assembly of the state of Missouri, as follows:
Section A. Section 161.670, RSMo, is repealed and one new section enacted in lieu
2 thereof, to be known as section 161.670, to read as follows:
161.670. 1. Notwithstanding any other law, prior to July 1, 2007, the state board of
2 education shall establish the "Missouri Course Access and Virtual School Program" to serve
3 school-age students residing in the state. The Missouri course access and virtual school
4 program shall offer nonclassroom-based instruction in a virtual setting using technology,
5 intranet, or internet methods of communication. Any student under the age of twenty-one in
6 grades kindergarten through twelve who resides in this state shall be eligible to enroll in the
7 Missouri course access and virtual school program pursuant to subsection 3 of this section.
8 2. (1) For purposes of calculation and distribution of state school aid, students
9 enrolled in the Missouri course access and virtual school program shall be included in the
10 student enrollment of the school district in which the student is enrolled under the relevant
11 provisions of subsection 3 of this section[; provided that any such] for such enrollment.

14 calculation under section 160.415,] using current-year pupil attendance for such full-time
15 virtual program pupils[; and further provided that]. The average daily attendance of a full-
16 time virtual student who is engaged in required instructional activities under subsection
17 4 of this section shall be calculated as if the pupil's attendance percentage equaled the

intended to be omitted from the law. Matter in bold-face type in the above bill is proposed language.
HB 2287 2
18 host district's prior-year average attendance percentage, and the provisions of section
19 162.1250 shall not apply to such funding calculation. In the case of a host school district
20 enrollingoneormorefull-timevirtualschoolstudents,suchenrollingdistrictshall,aspartof
21 its monthly state allocation, receive no less under the state aid calculation for such students
22 than an amount equal to the state adequacy target multiplied by the weighted average daily
23 attendance of such full-time students. Students residing in Missouri and enrolled in a full-
24 time virtual school program operated by a public institution of higher education in this state
25 shall be counted for a state aid calculation by the department, and the department shall pay,
26 from funds dedicated to state school aid payments made under section 163.031, to such
27 institution an amount equal to the state adequacy target multiplied by the weighted average
28 daily attendance of such full-time students.
29 (2) The Missouri course access and virtual school program shall report to the district
30 of residence the following information about each student served by the Missouri course
31 access and virtual school program: name, address, eligibility for free or reduced-price lunch,
32 limited English proficiency status, special education needs, and the number of courses in
33 which the student is enrolled. The Missouri course access and virtual school program shall
34 promptly notify the resident district when a student discontinues enrollment. A "full-time
35 equivalent student" is a student who is enrolled in the instructional equivalent of six credits
36 per regular term. Each Missouri course access and virtual school program course shall count
37 as one class and shall generate that portion of a full-time equivalent that a comparable course
38 offered by the school district would generate.
39 (3) Pursuant to an education services plan and collaborative agreement under
40 subsection 3 of this section, full-time equivalent students may be allowed to use a physical
41 locationoftheresidentschooldistrictforallorsomeportionofongoinginstructionalactivity,
42 and the enrollment plan shall provide for reimbursement of costs of the resident district for
43 providing such access pursuant to rules promulgated under this section by the department.
44 (4) In no case shall more than the full-time equivalency of a regular term of
45 attendance for a single student be used to claim state aid. Full-time equivalent student credit
46 completed shall be reported to the department of elementary and secondary education in the
47 manner prescribed by the department. Nothing in this section shall prohibit students from
48 enrolling in additional courses under a separate agreement that includes terms for paying
49 tuition or course fees.
50 (5) A full-time virtual school program serving full-time equivalent students shall be
51 considered an attendance center in the host school district and shall participate in the
52 statewide assessment system as defined in section 160.518. The academic performance of
53 students enrolled in a full-time virtual school program shall be assigned to the designated
54 attendance center of the full-time virtual school program and shall be considered in like
HB 2287 3
55 mannertootherattendancecenters. Theacademicperformanceofanystudentwhodisenrolls
56 from a full-time virtual school program and enrolls in a public school or charter school shall
57 not be used in determining the annual performance report score of the attendance center or
58 school district in which the student enrolls for twelve months from the date of enrollment.
59 (6) For the purposes of this section, a public institution of higher education operating
60 a full-time virtual school program shall be subject to all requirements applicable to a host
61 school district with respect to its full-time equivalent students.
62 3. (1) A student who resides in this state may enroll in Missouri course access and
63 virtual school program courses of his or her choice as a part of the student's annual course
64 load each school year, with any costs associated with such course or courses to be paid by the
65 school district or charter school if:
66 (a) The student is enrolled full-time in a public school, including any charter school;
67 and
68 (b) Prior to enrolling in any Missouri course access and virtual school program
69 course, a student has received approval from his or her school district or charter school
70 through the procedure described under subdivision (2) of this subsection.
71 (2) Each school district or charter school shall adopt a policy that delineates the
72 process by which a student may enroll in courses provided by the Missouri course access and
73 virtual school program that is substantially similar to the typical process by which a district
74 student would enroll in courses offered by the school district and a charter school student
75 would enroll in courses offered by the charter school. The policy may include consultation
76 withtheschool'scounselorandmayincludeparentalnotificationorauthorization. Thepolicy
77 shall ensure that available opportunities for in-person instruction are considered prior to
78 moving a student to virtual courses. The policy shall allow for continuous enrollment
79 throughout the school year. If the school district or charter school disapproves a student's
80 request to enroll in a course or courses provided by the Missouri course access and virtual
81 school program, the reason shall be provided in writing and it shall be for good cause. Good
82 cause justification to disapprove a student's request for enrollment in a course shall be a
83 determination that doing so is not in the best educational interest of the student, and shall be
84 consistent with the determination that would be made for such course request under the
85 process by which a district student would enroll in a similar course offered by the school
86 district and a charter school student would enroll in a similar course offered by the charter
87 school, except that the determination may consider the suitability of virtual courses for the
88 student based on prior participation in virtual courses by the student. Appeals of any course
89 denials under this subsection shall be considered under a policythat is substantially similar to
90 the typical process by which appeals would be considered for a student seeking to enroll in
HB 2287 4
91 courses offered by the school district and a charter school student seeking to enroll in courses
92 offered by the charter school.
93 (3) For students enrolled in any Missouri course access and virtual school program
94 course in which costs associated with such course are to be paid by the school district or
95 charter school as described under this subdivision, the school district or charter school shall
96 pay the content provider directly on a pro rata monthly basis based on a student's completion
97 of assignments and assessments. If a student discontinues enrollment, the district or charter
98 school may stop making monthly payments to the content provider. No school district or
99 charter school shall pay, for any one course for a student, more than the market necessary
100 costs but in no case shall pay more than fourteen percent of the state adequacy target, as
101 defined under section 163.011, as calculated at the end of the most recent school year for any
102 single, year-long course and no more than seven percent of the state adequacy target as
103 described above for any single semester equivalent course.
