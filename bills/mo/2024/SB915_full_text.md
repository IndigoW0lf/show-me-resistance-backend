25 the preceding calendar year and who has deferred in prior
26 years shall be permitted to file the application required by
27 section 135.063 until January thirty-first of the following
28 calendar year.
1 135.072. 1. At the time that the taxpayer elects to
2 defer property taxes pursuant to sections 135.060 to
3 135.089, the director shall estimate the amount of property

5 after January 1, 2025, and interest thereon. Thereafter,
6 the director shall have a lien in the amount of the estimate.
7 2. The lien created pursuant to subsection 1 of this
8 section shall attach to the property to which the election
9 to defer relates on January first of the tax year of initial
10 deferral.
11 3. The lien created under subsection 1 of this section
12 in the amount of the estimate shall have the same priority
13 as other real property tax liens except that the lien of
14 mortgages, trust deeds, or security interests which are
15 recorded or noted on a certificate of title prior in time to
16 the attachment of the lien for deferred taxes shall be prior
17 to the liens for deferred taxes.
18 4. If during the period of tax deferment, the amount
19 of taxes, interest and fees exceeds the estimate, the
20 director shall have a lien for the amount of the excess.
21 The liens for the excess shall attach to the property on

23 The lien for the excess shall have the same priority as
24 other real property tax liens, except that the lien of
25 mortgages, trust deeds, or security interests recorded or
26 noted on any certificate of title prior in time to the date
27 that the director records an amendment to its estimate to
SB 915 9
28 reflect its lien for the excess shall be prior to the lien
29 for the excess.
30 5. Notwithstanding the provisions of section 135.066,
31 the notice of lien for deferred taxes recorded as provided
32 in section 135.066 arising on or after January 1, 2025,

37 subsection 4 of this section, shall list the amount of the
38 excess that the director claims as lien.
39 6. A lien created pursuant to this section may be
40 foreclosed by the director pursuant to the law relating to
41 foreclosure in civil suits or any other collection methods
42 given the director of revenue. The court may award
43 reasonable attorney fees to the prevailing party in a
44 foreclosure action pursuant to this section.
45 7. Receipts from foreclosure proceedings shall be
46 credited in the same manner as other repayments of deferred
47 property taxes pursuant to section 135.089.
48 8. By means of voluntary payment made as provided
49 pursuant to section 135.080, the taxpayer may limit the
50 amount of the lien for deferred taxes created pursuant to
51 this section. If the taxpayer desires that the limit be
52 reflected in the records of the county, the taxpayer shall
53 request, subject to any rules adopted by the director, that
54 the director cause a partial satisfaction of the lien to be
55 recorded in the county. Upon receipt of such a request, the
56 director shall cause a partial satisfaction, in the amount
57 of the voluntary payment, to be so recorded. Nothing in
58 this subsection shall affect the priority of the liens of
SB 915 10
59 the director, as originally created pursuant to subsections
60 1 and 4 of this section.

1 135.074. Subject to section 135.078, all deferred
2 property taxes, including accrued interest, become payable
3 as provided in section 135.076 when:
4 (1) The taxpayer who claimed deferment of collection
5 of property taxes on the homestead dies or, if there was
6 more than one claimant, the survivor of the taxpayers who
7 originally claimed deferment of collection of property taxes
8 pursuant to section 135.061 dies;
9 (2) Except as provided in section 135.072, the
10 property with respect to which deferment of collection of
11 taxes is claimed is sold, or a contract to sell is entered
12 into, or some person other than the taxpayer who claimed the
13 deferment becomes the owner of the property;
14 (3) The tax-deferred property is no longer the
15 homestead of the taxpayer who claimed the deferral, except
16 in the case of a taxpayer required to be absent from such
17 tax-deferred property by reason of health;
18 (4) The tax-deferred property, a manufactured
19 structure or floating home, is moved out of the state; or
20 (5) Any outstanding indebtedness against the tax-
21 deferred property is refinanced.
1 135.076. 1. Whenever any of the circumstances listed
2 in section 135.074 occurs:
3 (1) The deferral of taxes for the assessment year in
4 which the circumstance occurs shall continue for such
5 assessment year; and
SB 915 11
6 (2) The amounts of deferred property taxes, including
7 accrued interest, for all years shall be due and payable on
8 the date of closing or the date of probate to the director,
9 except as provided in subsection 3 of this section, section
10 135.078 and section 135.084.
11 2. Notwithstanding the provisions of subsection 1 of
12 this section and section 135.084, when the circumstances
13 listed in subdivision (4) of section 135.074 occur, the
14 amount of deferred taxes shall be due and payable five days
15 before the date of removal of the property from the state.
16 3. If the amounts falling due as provided in this
17 section are not paid on the indicated due date, or as
18 extended pursuant to section 135.084, such amounts shall be
19 deemed delinquent as of that date and the property shall be
20 subject to foreclosure as provided in section 135.072.
1 135.078. 1. Notwithstanding the provisions of section
2 135.074, when one of the circumstances listed in section
3 135.074 occurs, the spouse who was not eligible to or did
4 not file a claim jointly with the taxpayer may continue the
5 property in its deferred tax status by filing a claim within
6 the time and in the manner provided pursuant to section
7 135.061 if:
8 (1) The spouse of the taxpayer is or will be sixty
9 years of age or older not later than six months from the day
10 the circumstance listed in section 135.074 occurs; and
11 (2) The property is the homestead of the spouse of the
12 taxpayer and meets the requirements of subsection 2 of
13 section 135.062.
14 2. A spouse who does not meet the age requirements of
15 subsection 1 of this section but is otherwise qualified to
16 continue the property in its tax-deferred status pursuant to
17 subsection 1 of this section may continue the deferral of
SB 915 12
18 property taxes deferred for previous years by filing a claim
19 within the time and in the manner provided pursuant to
20 section 135.061. If a spouse eligible for and continuing
21 the deferral of taxes previously deferred pursuant to this
22 subsection becomes fifty-nine and one half years of age
23 prior to October fifteenth of any year, the spouse may elect
24 to continue the deferral of previous years' taxes deferred
25 pursuant to this subsection and may elect to defer the
26 current assessment year's taxes on the homestead by filing a
27 claim within the time and in the manner provided pursuant to
28 section 135.061. Thereafter, payment of the taxes levied on
29 the homestead and deferred pursuant to this subsection and
30 payment of taxes levied on the homestead in the current
31 assessment year and in future years may be deferred in the
32 manner provided in and subject to sections 135.060 to
33 135.089.
34 3. Notwithstanding that section 135.061 requires that
35 a claim be filed no later than October fifteenth, if the
36 director determines that good and sufficient cause exists
37 for the failure of a spouse to file a claim pursuant to this
38 section on or before October fifteenth, the claim may be
39 filed within one hundred eighty days after notice of taxes
40 due and payable pursuant to section 135.060 is mailed or
41 delivered by the director to the taxpayer or spouse.
1 135.080. 1. All payments of deferred taxes shall be
2 made to the director.
3 2. Any payment made pursuant to this section shall be
4 applied first against accrued interest and any remainder
5 against the deferred taxes. Such payment shall not affect
6 the deferred tax status of the property. Unless otherwise
7 provided by law, such payment shall not give the person
8 paying the taxes any interest in the property or any claim
SB 915 13
9 against the estate, in the absence of a valid agreement to
10 the contrary.
11 3. When the deferred taxes and accrued interest are
12 paid in full and the property is no longer subject to
13 deferral, the director shall prepare and record in the
14 county in which the property is located a satisfaction of
15 deferred property tax lien.
1 135.082. 1. At the time the property is deeded over
2 to the county at the conclusion of the foreclosure
3 proceedings pursuant to chapter 141, the court shall order
4 the county treasurer to pay to the director, from the
5 unsegregated tax collections account, the amount of deferred
6 taxes and interest which were not collected.
7 2. Immediately upon payment, the county treasurer
8 shall notify the collector of the amount paid to the
9 director for the property which has been deeded to the
10 county.
1 135.084. 1. The director may extend the time for
2 payment of the deferred taxes and interest accruing with
3 respect to the taxes becoming due and payable pursuant to
4 subsection 2 of section 135.076 if:
5 (1) The taxpayer who claimed homestead property tax
6 deferral dies, or if a spouse who continued the deferral
7 pursuant to section 135.078 dies;
8 (2) The homestead property becomes property of an
9 individual or individuals:
10 (a) By inheritance or devise; or
11 (b) If the individual or individuals are heirs or
12 devisees, as defined pursuant to section 472.010, in the
13 course of settlement of the estate;
14 (3) The individual or individuals commence occupancy
15 of the property as a principal residence on or before
SB 915 14
16 February fifteenth of the calendar year following the
17 calendar year of death; and
18 (4) The individual or individuals make application to
19 the director for an extension of time for payment of the
20 deferred taxes and interest prior to February fifteenth of
21 the calendar year following the calendar year of death.
22 2. (1) Subject to subdivision (2) of this subsection,
23 an extension granted pursuant to this section shall be for a
24 period not to exceed five years after February fifteenth of
25 the calendar year following the calendar year of death. The
26 terms and conditions under which the extension is granted
27 shall be in accordance with a written agreement entered into
28 by the director and the individual or individuals.
29 (2) An extension granted pursuant to this section
30 shall terminate immediately if:
31 (a) The homestead property is sold or otherwise
32 transferred by any party to the extension agreement;
33 (b) All of the heirs or devisees who are parties to
34 the extension agreement cease to occupy the property as a
35 principal residence; or
36 (c) The homestead property, a manufactured structure
37 or floating home, is moved out of the state.
38 3. If the director has reason to believe that the
39 homestead property is not sufficient security for the
40 deferred taxes and interest, the director may require the
41 individual or individuals to furnish a bond conditioned upon
42 payment of the amount extended in accordance with the terms
43 of the extension. The bond shall not exceed an amount
44 double the taxes with respect to which tax extension is
45 granted.
46 4. During the period of extension, and until paid, the
47 deferred taxes shall continue to accrue interest in the same
SB 915 15
48 manner and at the same rate as provided pursuant to
49 subsection 3 of section 135.064. No interest shall accrue
50 upon interest.
51 5. When any taxpayer who claimed homestead property
52 tax deferral dies, the spouse, heirs and devisees, as
53 defined pursuant to section 472.010, shall notify in writing
54 the director of the taxpayer's death.
1 135.086. Nothing in sections 135.060 to 135.089 is
2 intended to or shall be construed to:
3 (1) Prevent the collection, by foreclosure, of
4 property taxes which become a lien against tax-deferred
5 property;
6 (2) Defer payment of special assessments to benefitted
7 property which assessments do not appear on the assessment
8 and tax roll; or
9 (3) Affect any provision of any mortgage or other
10 instrument relating to land requiring a person to pay
11 property taxes.
1 135.088. After August 28, 2024, it shall be unlawful
2 for any mortgage trust deed or land sale contract to contain
3 a clause or statement which prohibits the owner from
4 applying for the benefits of the deferral of homestead
5 property taxes provided in sections 135.060 to 135.089. Any
6 such clause or statement in a mortgage trust deed or land
7 sale contract executed after August 28, 2024, shall be void.

2 treasury the "Property Tax Deferral Revolving Account" which
3 shall consist of money collected under this section. The
4 state treasurer shall be custodian of the account. In
5 accordance with sections 30.170 and 30.180, the state
6 treasurer may approve disbursements. Upon appropriation,
7 money in the account shall be used solely for the purposes

8 in sections 135.060 to 135.089. Notwithstanding the
9 provisions of section 33.080, to the contrary, any moneys
10 remaining in the account at the end of the biennium shall
11 not revert to the credit of the general revenue fund. The
12 state treasurer shall invest moneys in the account in the
13 same manner as other funds are invested. Any interest and
14 moneys earned on such investments shall be credited to the
15 account.
16 2. The moneys in the account shall be used by the
17 director of revenue for the purpose of making the payments
18 to:
19 (1) County collectors of property taxes deferred for
20 tax years beginning on or after January 1, 2025, as required
21 by section 135.068;
22 (2) The director for its expenses in administering the

24 3. The funds necessary to make payments under
25 subsection 1 of this section shall be advanced annually to
26 the director.
27 4. The property tax deferral revolving account may
