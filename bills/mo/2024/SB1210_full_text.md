102ND GENERA L ASSEMBLY
INTRODUCED BY SENATOR ARTHUR.
3868S.01I KRISTINA MARTIN, Secretary
AN ACT
To repeal section 99.805, RSMo, and to enact in lieu thereof one new section relating to tax
increment financing.
Be it enacted by the General Assembly of the State of Missouri, as follows:
1 Section A. Section 99.805, RSMo, is repealed and one new
2 section enacted in lieu thereof, to be known as section 99.805,
3 to read as follows:
1 99.805. As used in sections 99.800 to 99.865, unless
2 the context clearly requires otherwise, the following terms
3 shall mean:
4 (1) "Blighted area", an area which, by reason of the
5 predominance of insanitary or unsafe conditions,
6 deterioration of site improvements, or the existence of
7 conditions which endanger life or property by fire and other
8 causes, or any combination of such factors, retards the
9 provision of housing accommodations or constitutes an
10 economic or social liability or a menace to the public
11 health, safety, or welfare in its present condition and use;
12 (2) "Collecting officer", the officer of the
13 municipality responsible for receiving and processing
14 payments in lieu of taxes or economic activity taxes from
15 taxpayers or the department of revenue;
16 (3) "Conservation area", any improved area within the
17 boundaries of a redevelopment area located within the
18 territorial limits of a municipality in which fifty percent
SB 1210 2
19 or more of the structures in the area have an age of thirty-
20 five years or more. Such an area is not yet a blighted area
21 but is detrimental to the public health, safety, or welfare
22 and may become a blighted area because of any one or more of
23 the following factors: dilapidation; obsolescence;
24 deterioration; illegal use of individual structures;
25 presence of structures below minimum code standards;
26 abandonment; excessive vacancies; overcrowding of structures
27 and community facilities; lack of ventilation, light or
28 sanitary facilities; inadequate utilities; excessive land
29 coverage; deleterious land use or layout; depreciation of
30 physical maintenance; and lack of community planning. A
31 conservation area shall meet at least three of the factors
32 provided in this subdivision for projects approved on or
33 after December 23, 1997. For all redevelopment plans and
34 projects approved on or after January 1, 2022, in retail
35 areas, a conservation area shall meet the dilapidation
36 factor as one of the three factors required under this
37 subdivision;
38 (4) "Economic activity taxes", the total additional
39 revenue from taxes which are imposed by a municipality and
40 other taxing districts, and which are generated by economic
41 activities within a redevelopment area over the amount of
42 such taxes generated by economic activities within such
43 redevelopment area in the calendar year prior to the
44 adoption of the ordinance designating such a redevelopment
45 area, while tax increment financing remains in effect, but
46 excluding personal property taxes, taxes imposed on sales or
47 charges for sleeping rooms paid by transient guests of
48 hotels and motels, licenses, fees or special assessments.
49 For redevelopment projects or redevelopment plans approved
50 after December 23, 1997, if a retail establishment relocates
SB 1210 3
51 within one year from one facility to another facility within
52 the same county and the governing body of the municipality
53 finds that the relocation is a direct beneficiary of tax
54 increment financing, then for purposes of this definition,
55 the economic activity taxes generated by the retail
56 establishment shall equal the total additional revenues from
57 economic activity taxes which are imposed by a municipality
58 or other taxing district over the amount of economic
59 activity taxes generated by the retail establishment in the
60 calendar year prior to its relocation to the redevelopment
61 area;
62 (5) "Economic development area", any area or portion
63 of an area located within the territorial limits of a
64 municipality, which does not meet the requirements of
65 subdivisions (1) and (3) of this section, and in which the
66 governing body of the municipality finds that redevelopment
67 will not be solely used for development of commercial
68 businesses which unfairly compete in the local economy and
69 is in the public interest because it will:
70 (a) Discourage commerce, industry or manufacturing
71 from moving their operations to another state; or
72 (b) Result in increased employment in the
73 municipality; or
74 (c) Result in preservation or enhancement of the tax
75 base of the municipality;
76 (6) "Gambling establishment", an excursion gambling
77 boat as defined in section 313.800 and any related business
78 facility including any real property improvements which are
79 directly and solely related to such business facility, whose
80 sole purpose is to provide goods or services to an excursion
81 gambling boat and whose majority ownership interest is held
82 by a person licensed to conduct gambling games on an
SB 1210 4
83 excursion gambling boat or licensed to operate an excursion
84 gambling boat as provided in sections 313.800 to 313.850.

88 agricultural property that is located wholly outside the
89 incorporated limits of a city, town, or village, or that is
90 substantially surrounded by contiguous properties with
