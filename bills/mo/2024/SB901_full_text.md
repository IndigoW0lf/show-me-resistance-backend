Be it enacted by the General Assembly of the State of Missouri, as follows:
1 Section A. Chapter 575, RSMo, is amended by adding thereto
2 one new section, to be known as section 575.151, to read as
3 follows:
1 575.151. 1. This section shall be known and may be
2 cited as "Valentine's Law".
3 2. A person commits the offense of aggravated fleeing
4 a stop or detention of a motor vehicle if he or she knows or
5 reasonably should know that a law enforcement officer is
6 attempting to detain or stop a motor vehicle, and for the
7 purpose of preventing the officer from effecting the stop or
8 detention, he or she flees and:
9 (1) Such person operates a motor vehicle at a high
10 speed or in any manner which creates a substantial risk of
11 serious physical injury or death to any person;
12 (2) As a result of such flight causes physical injury
13 to another person; or
14 (3) As a result of such flight causes death to another
15 person.
16 3. A person is presumed to be fleeing a vehicle stop
17 or detention if he or she continues to operate a motor
18 vehicle after he or she has seen or reasonably should have
