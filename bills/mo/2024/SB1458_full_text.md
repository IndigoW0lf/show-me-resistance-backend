SB 1458 2
18 2. Each local school district may set its opening date
19 each year, which date shall be no earlier than fourteen
20 calendar days prior to the first Monday in September. No
21 public school district shall select an earlier start date
22 unless, for calendars for school years before school year
23 2020-21, the district follows the procedure set forth in
24 subsection 3 of this section. The procedure set forth in
25 subsection 3 of this section shall be unavailable to school
26 districts in preparing their calendars for school year 2020-
27 21 and for subsequent years.
28 3. For calendars for school years before school year
29 2020-21, a district may set an opening date that is more
30 than fourteen calendar days prior to the first Monday in
31 September only if the local school board first gives public
32 notice of a public meeting to discuss the proposal of
33 opening school on a date more than fourteen days prior to
34 the first Monday in September, and the local school board
35 holds said meeting and, at the same public meeting, a
36 majority of the board votes to allow an earlier opening
37 date. If all of the previous conditions are met, the
38 district may set its opening date more than fourteen
39 calendar days prior to the first Monday in September. The
40 condition provided in this subsection must be satisfied by
41 the local school board each year that the board proposes an
42 opening date more than fourteen days before the first Monday
43 in September.
44 4. If any local district violates the provisions of
45 this section, the department of elementary and secondary
46 education shall withhold an amount equal to one quarter of
47 the state funding the district generated under section
48 163.031 for each date the district was in violation of this
49 section.
SB 1458 3
50 5. The provisions of subsections 2 to 4 of this
51 section shall not apply to any school district in which one
52 or more charter schools are operated under the provisions of
53 sections 160.400 to 160.425 or to school districts in which
54 school is in session for twelve months of each calendar year.
55 6. The state board of education may grant an exemption
56 from this section to a school district that demonstrates
57 highly unusual and extenuating circumstances justifying
58 exemption from the provisions of subsections 2 to 4 of this
59 section. Any exemption granted by the state board of
60 education shall be valid for one academic year only.
