6 by the court, or with leave of the court, the parties may:
7 (1) Notify the court that all of the parties have chosen to pursue an alternative
8 dispute resolution process different from the nonbinding alternative dispute resolution
9 process ordered by the court if such choice is evidenced in a written agreement between
10 the parties;
11 (2) Notify the court that all of the parties have agreedto delay such process until
12 a date certain, which date may be subsequently modified by the court, to allow for the

20 substantive issues in the matter or there is a compelling circumstance for not
21 participating in the alternative dispute resolution process. Once a motion for relief has
22 beenfiled,thealternativedisputeresolutionprocessorderedbythecourtshallnotoccur
23 until the court has ruled on the motion. If the court grants the motion, the matter shall
24 not thereafter be referred by the court to an alternative dispute resolution process
25 without compelling circumstances, which shall be set out by the court in any order
26 referring the matter to an alternative dispute resolution process.
27 3. In an action referred to an alternative dispute resolution process, discovery
28 may proceed as in any other action before, during, and after the alternative dispute
29 resolution process is held. The court may stay discovery in whole or in part during the
30 pendency of an alternative dispute resolution process in order to promote savings in
31 time and expense without sacrificing the quality of justice.
32 4. Aneutralwhoisappointed bythecourtorrequestedbythepartiestoservein
33 an alternative dispute resolution process under sections 435.300 to 435.312 shall avoid
34 any conflict of interest. If the neutral believes that no disqualifying conflict exists, the
35 neutral shall:
HB 1886 5
36 (1) Make a reasonable inquiry to determine whether there are any facts that
37 would cause a reasonable person to believe that the neutral has an actual or potential
38 conflict of interest before agreeing to serve in a matter;
39 (2) Disclose to the parties, as soon as practicable, facts and information relevant
40 to any actual or potential conflicts of interest that are reasonably known to the neutral;
41 and
42 (3) If,afteracceptingadesignationbythepartiesorthecourt,theneutrallearns
43 of any previously undisclosed information that could reasonably suggest a conflict of
44 interest, promptly disclose the information to the parties.
45 5. After the neutral's disclosure of a conflict, the alternative dispute resolution
46 process may proceed if:
47 (1) All parties agree in writing to service by the neutral; or
48 (2) An organization independently administering the alternative dispute
49 resolution process under rules of procedure that were adopted by a written
50 agreement of the parties determines under such rules that the neutral may continue
51 to serve.
52 6. Any party who believes a court-appointed neutral has a conflict of interest
53 may request that the neutral recuse himself or herself if a conflict is disclosed or
54 otherwisediscovered. Iftheneutraldeclines,thepartymaytimelyfileamotionwiththe
55 court for disqualification of the neutral. Failure to file a motion waives that objection.
56 On its own motion, the court may also review the choice of a neutral in any alternative
57 dispute resolution process involving a party that is not represented by counsel and
58 require a change of neutral if necessary to protect the rights of the unrepresented party.
435.306. 1. Alternative dispute resolution communications shall not be
2 admissible as evidence in any proceeding or subject to discovery, except as otherwise
3 provided under subsections 2, 3, and 7 of this section. Exceptions shall be narrowly
4 construed and only the portion of the communication necessary for the application of
5 the exception to the general rule of nonadmissibility shall be admitted.
6 2. Evidence or information that is otherwise admissible or subject to discovery,
7 including information that would be available to the public under sections 610.010 to
8 610.035, shall not become inadmissible or protected from discovery solely by reason of
9 its disclosure or use in an alternative dispute resolution process.
10 3. A court may determine to admit an alternative dispute resolution
11 communication upon motion of a party, which motion shall not reveal the substance
12 ofthecommunication,andfollowingahearingonlyifthecourtfindsthatoneormoreof

33 on behalf of a participant based on conduct occurring during the alternative dispute
34 resolution process.
35 4. The admission of evidence in a proceeding under any of the exceptions stated
36 under subsection 3 of this section shall not in itself render the evidence or any other
37 alternative dispute resolution communication discoverable or admissible for any other
38 purpose or proceeding.
39 5. Any participant in an alternative dispute resolution process has standing to
40 intervene in any proceeding to object to the admissibility of an alternative dispute
41 resolution communication made by that participant during or relating to that
42 alternative dispute resolution process. A neutral who participated in an alternative
43 dispute resolution process also has standing to intervene in any proceeding to object to
44 the admissibility of an alternative dispute resolution communication made by the
45 neutral or an agent or employee of a neutral or of an organization through which the
46 neutral provided the alternative dispute resolution services for such process, but the
47 neutral is under no requirement to do so.

63 the written agreement was signed by the parties in the presence of the neutral.
64 8. The court may request that the neutral or the parties provide the court with
65 progress reports on alternative dispute resolution processes related to pending civil
66 actions; provided that, such reports shall be limited to a statement that the matter has
67 beenresolved in its entirety, partiallyresolved, or not resolved andwhether future dates

73 dispute resolution communication to pay the costs and fees of the neutral or other

76 who responds to a subpoena prohibited under subsection 6 of this section or a subpoena
77 under subsection 7 of this section.
