3 and incidental funds for a school district as reported to the proper officer of each county
4 pursuant to section 164.011;
5 (2) "Average daily attendance", the quotient or the sum of the quotients obtained by
6 dividing the total number of hours attended in a term by resident pupils between the ages of
7 five and twenty-one by the actual number of hours school was in session in that term. To the
8 average daily attendance of the following school term shall be added the full-time equivalent
9 average daily attendance of summer school students. "Full-time equivalent average daily
10 attendance of summer school students" shall be computed by dividing the total number of
11 hours, except for physical education hours that do not count as credit toward graduation for
12 students in grades nine, ten, eleven, and twelve, attended by all summer school pupils by the
13 number of hours required in section 160.011 in the school term. For purposes of determining

183 within the special district and not in the district of residence for purposes of distributing the
184 state aid derived from the special education pupil count;
185 (17) "Special education threshold" shall be calculated by dividing the total special

197 The recalculation shall never result in a decrease from the state adequacy target as calculated
198 for fiscal years 2017 and 2018 and any state adequacy target figure calculated subsequent to
199 fiscal year 2018. Should a recalculation result in an increase in the state adequacy target
200 amount, fifty percent of that increase shall be included in the state adequacy target amount in
201 the year of recalculation, and fifty percent of that increase shall be included in the state
