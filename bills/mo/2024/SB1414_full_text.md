1 84.020. In all cities [of this state that now have, or
2 may hereafter attain, a population of five hundred thousand
3 inhabitants or over], there shall be, and is hereby
4 established, within and for said cities, a board of police,
5 to consist of four commissioners, as provided in sections
6 84.040 to 84.080, together with the mayor of said cities for
7 the time being, or whosoever may be officially acting in
8 that capacity, and said board shall appoint one of its
9 members as president, and one member who shall act as vice
10 president during the absence of the president; and such
11 president or vice president shall be the executive officer
12 of the board and shall act for it when the board is not in
13 session.
1 84.030. Beginning on [January 9, 1989] August 28,
2 2024, and no later than September 28, 2024, the governor of
3 the state of Missouri, by and with the advice and consent of

12 appointment and until their successors shall have been
13 appointed and qualified. In case of a vacancy in said board
14 for any cause whatsoever, it shall be filled by appointment
15 for the unexpired term, in the same manner as in the case of
16 original appointments. The governor shall issue commissions
SB 1414 3
17 to the persons so appointed, designating the time for which
18 they are appointed in case the appointment is to fill an
19 unexpired term occasioned by death, resignation or any other
20 cause, and whenever the term of office of any commissioner
21 expires, the appointment of his successor shall be for four

1 84.100. To enable the boards to perform the duties
2 imposed upon them, they are hereby authorized and required
3 to appoint, enroll and employ [a] only one permanent police
4 force for the cities which they shall equip and arm as they
5 may judge necessary. Except as provided below, the number
6 of patrolmen to be appointed shall not be [more] less than
7 one thousand [six] three hundred [eighty-three] thirteen, of
8 which number not more than two hundred fifty are to be

10 patrolmen authorized, in addition to that provided for
11 above, shall be permitted upon recommendation by the board
12 of police commissioners, with the approval of the municipal
13 board of estimate and apportionment. [The number of
14 turnkeys to be appointed shall be sixty-five, except that

16 resigned or otherwise separated from the force, an
17 additional turnkey may be appointed, but under no
18 circumstances shall more than one hundred fifty turnkeys be
19 appointed. As each additional turnkey is appointed, the
20 maximum number of patrolmen to be appointed shall be reduced
21 accordingly so that when one hundred fifty turnkeys have
22 been appointed, the number of patrolmen to be appointed
SB 1414 4
23 shall not be more than one thousand five hundred ninety-
24 eight.] The board may continue to employ as many
25 noncommissioned police civilians, which shall include city
26 marshals and park rangers, as it deems necessary in order to
27 perform the duties imposed upon it.
1 84.150. The maximum number of officers of the police
2 force in each such city shall be as follows: [one chief of

6 deems necessary] seventy-six commissioned officers at the
7 rank of lieutenant and above; two hundred commissioned
8 officers at the rank of sergeant; and one thousand thirty-
9 seven commissioned officers at the rank of patrolman. The
10 officers of the police force shall have commissions issued

12 heretofore and those hereafter commissioned shall serve so
13 long as they shall faithfully perform their duties and
14 possess the necessary mental and physical ability, and be
15 subject to removal only for cause after a hearing by the
16 board, who are hereby invested with exclusive jurisdiction
17 in the premises.
1 84.160. 1. As of August 28, [2006] 2024, the board of
2 police commissioners shall have the authority to compute and

6 paid to any member at the time of the enactment of this act.
7 2. Each officer of police and patrolman whose regular
8 assignment requires nonuniformed attire may receive, in
9 addition to his or her salary, an allowance not to exceed

16 other provision of law to the contrary, nothing in this
17 section shall prohibit the payment of additional

30 not limited to, costs of funding pensions or retirement
31 plans) for any fiscal year a sum in excess of any limitation
32 imposed by article X, section 21, Missouri Constitution; and
33 provided further, that such municipal assembly or common

37 cities.
38 4. Notwithstanding the provisions of subsection 1 of

SB 1414 9
1 84.325. 1. On August 28, 2024, the board of police
2 commissioners shall assume control of any municipal police
3 force according to the procedures and requirements of this
4 section and any rules promulgated under subsection 6 of this
5 section. The purpose of these procedures and requirements
6 is to provide for an orderly and appropriate transition in
7 the governance of the police force and provide for an
8 equitable employment transition for commissioned and
9 civilian personnel.
10 2. Upon the assumption of control by the board of
11 police commissioners under subsection 1 of this section, any
12 municipal police department shall convey, assign, and
13 otherwise transfer to the board title and ownership of all
14 indebtedness and assets, including, but not limited to, all
15 funds and real and personal property held in the name of or
16 controlled by the municipal police department. Such city
17 shall thereafter cease the operation of any police
18 department or police force.
19 3. Upon the assumption of control by the board of
20 police commissioners under subsection 1 of this section, the
21 state shall accept responsibility, ownership, and liability
22 as successor-in-interest for contractual obligations and
23 other lawful obligations of the municipal police department.
24 4. The board of police commissioners shall initially
25 employ, without a reduction in rank, salary, or benefits,
26 all commissioned and civilian personnel of the municipal
27 police department who were employed by the municipal police
28 department immediately prior to the date the board assumed
29 control. The board shall recognize all accrued years of
30 service that such commissioned and civilian personnel had
31 with the municipal police department, as well as all accrued
32 years of service that such commissioned and civilian
SB 1414 10
33 personnel had previously with the board of police
34 commissioners. Such personnel shall be entitled to the same
35 holidays, vacation, sick leave, sick bonus time, and annual
36 step-increases they were entitled to as employees of the
37 municipal police department.
38 5. The commissioned and civilian personnel who retire
39 from service with the municipal police department before the
40 board of police commissioners assumes control of the
41 department under subsection 1 of this section shall continue
42 to be entitled to the same pension benefits provided as
43 employees of the municipal police department and the same
44 benefits set forth in subsection 5 of this section. Any
45 police pension system created under chapter 86 for the
46 benefit of a police force established under sections 84.012
47 to 84.340 shall continue to be governed by chapter 86 and
48 shall apply to any comprehensive policing plan and any
49 police force established under sections 84.012 to 84.340.
50 Other than any provision that makes chapter 86 applicable to
51 a municipal police force established under sections 84.343
52 to 84.346, nothing in sections 84.012 to 84.340 shall be
53 construed as limiting or changing the rights or benefits
54 provided under chapter 86.
55 6. The board of police commissioners may promulgate
56 all necessary rules and regulations for the implementation
57 and administration of this section. Any rule or portion of
58 a rule, as that term is defined in section 536.010, that is
59 created under the authority delegated in this section shall
60 become effective only if it complies with and is subject to
61 all of the provisions of chapter 536 and, if applicable,
62 section 536.028. This section and chapter 536 are
63 nonseverable and if any of the powers vested with the
64 general assembly pursuant to chapter 536 to review, to delay
SB 1414 11
65 the effective date, or to disapprove and annul a rule are
66 subsequently held unconstitutional, then the grant of
67 rulemaking authority and any rule proposed or adopted after
68 August 28, 2024, shall be invalid and void.
1 105.726. 1. Nothing in sections 105.711 to 105.726
2 shall be construed to broaden the liability of the state of
3 Missouri beyond the provisions of sections 537.600 to
4 537.610, nor to abolish or waive any defense at law which
5 might otherwise be available to any agency, officer, or
6 employee of the state of Missouri. Sections 105.711 to
7 105.726 do not waive the sovereign immunity of the state of
8 Missouri.
9 2. The creation of the state legal expense fund and
10 the payment therefrom of such amounts as may be necessary
11 for the benefit of any person covered thereby are deemed
12 necessary and proper public purposes for which funds of this
13 state may be expended.
14 3. Moneys in the state legal expense fund shall not be
15 available for the payment of any claim or any amount
16 required by any final judgment rendered by a court of
17 competent jurisdiction against a board of police
18 commissioners established under chapter 84, including the
19 commissioners, any police officer, notwithstanding sections
20 84.330 and 84.710, or other provisions of law, other
21 employees, agents, representative, or any other individual
22 or entity acting or purporting to act on its or their
23 behalf. Such was the intent of the general assembly in the
24 original enactment of sections 105.711 to 105.726, and it is
25 made express by this section in light of the decision in
26 Wayman Smith, III, et al. v. State of Missouri, 152 S.W.3d
27 275. Except that the commissioner of administration shall
28 reimburse from the legal expense fund the board of police
SB 1414 12
29 commissioners established under [section 84.350, and any
30 successor-in-interest established pursuant to section
31 84.344,] chapter 84 for liability claims otherwise eligible
32 for payment under section 105.711 paid by such [board]
33 boards on an equal share basis per claim up to a maximum of
34 one million dollars per fiscal year.
35 4. [Subject to the provisions of subsection 2 of
36 section 84.345,] If the representation of the attorney
37 general is requested by a board of police commissioners [or
38 its successor-in-interest established pursuant to section
39 84.344], the attorney general shall represent, investigate,
40 defend, negotiate, or compromise all claims under sections
41 105.711 to 105.726 for the board of police commissioners,
42 its successor-in-interest pursuant to section 84.344, any
43 police officer, other employees, agents, representatives, or
44 any other individual or entity acting or purporting to act
45 on their behalf. The attorney general may establish
46 procedures by rules promulgated under chapter 536 under
47 which claims must be referred for the attorney general's
48 representation. The attorney general and the officials of
49 the city which the police board represents [or represented]
50 shall meet and negotiate reasonable expenses or charges that
51 will fairly compensate the attorney general and the office
52 of administration for the cost of the representation of the
53 claims under this section.
54 5. Claims tendered to the attorney general promptly
55 after the claim was asserted as required by section 105.716
56 and prior to August 28, 2005, may be investigated, defended,
57 negotiated, or compromised by the attorney general and full
58 payments may be made from the state legal expense fund on
59 behalf of the entities and individuals described in this
SB 1414 13
60 section as a result of the holding in Wayman Smith, III, et
61 al. v. State of Missouri, 152 S.W.3d 275.

9 police and shall be provided training,
10 equipment, uniforms, and arms as the chief shall
11 direct with the approval of the board. Members
12 of the reserve force shall possess all of the
13 powers of regular police officers and shall be
14 subject to all laws and regulations applicable
15 to police officers; provided, however, that the
16 city council or other governing body of any such

18 which the reserve force may not exceed.
19 2. In event of riot or other emergencies
20 as declared and defined by the mayor, in

6 force established under sections 84.343 to
7 84.346 in the performance of his or her job
8 duties, or with any aspect of any investigation
9 arising from the performance of such job
10 duties. This section shall not be construed to
11 prevent such officials from acting within the
12 normal course and scope of their employment or
13 from acting to implement sections 84.343 to
14 84.346. Any person who violates this section
15 shall be liable for a penalty of two thousand
16 five hundred dollars for each offense and shall
17 forever be disqualified from holding any office
18 or employment whatsoever with the governmental
19 entity the person served at the time of the
20 violation. The penalty shall not be paid by the
21 funds of any committee as the term committee is
22 defined in section 130.011. This section shall
23 not be construed to interfere with the
24 punishment, under any laws of this state, of a
25 criminal offense committed by such officials,
26 nor shall this section apply to duly appointed
27 members of the municipal police force, or their
28 appointing authorities, whose conduct is
29 otherwise provided for by law.]

2 employment practice for an official, employee,

17 2. Any person who acts as a private

23 accomplish such transfer of ownership and
24 obligations.
25 3. If the city establishes a municipal
26 police force and completes the transfer
SB 1414 16
27 described in subsection 2 of this section, the
28 city shall provide the necessary funds for the
29 maintenance of the municipal police force.
30 4. Before a city not within a county may
31 establish a municipal police force under this
32 section, the city shall adopt an ordinance
33 accepting responsibility, ownership, and
34 liability as successor-in-interest for
35 contractual obligations, indebtedness, and other
36 lawful obligations of the board of police
37 commissioners subject to the provisions of
38 subsection 2 of section 84.345.
39 5. A city not within a county that
40 establishes a municipal police force shall
41 initially employ, without a reduction in rank,
42 salary, or benefits, all commissioned and
43 civilian personnel of the board of police
44 commissioners created under sections 84.010 to
45 84.340 that were employed by the board
46 immediately prior to the date the municipal
47 police force was established. Such commissioned
48 personnel who previously were employed by the
49 board may only be involuntarily terminated by
50 the city not within a county for cause. The
51 city shall also recognize all accrued years of
52 service that such commissioned and civilian
53 personnel had with the board of police
54 commissioners. Such personnel shall be entitled
55 to the same holidays, vacation, and sick leave
56 they were entitled to as employees of the board
57 of police commissioners.
58 6. Commissioned and civilian personnel of
59 a municipal police force established under this
60 section shall not be subject to a residency
61 requirement of retaining a primary residence in

64 one-hour response time.
65 7. The commissioned and civilian personnel
66 who retire from service with the board of police

SB 1414 17
71 86 and the same benefits set forth in subsection
72 5 of this section.
73 8. If the city not within a county elects
74 to establish a municipal police force under this
75 section, the city shall establish a separate
76 division for the operation of its municipal
77 police force. The civil service commission of
78 the city may adopt rules and regulations
79 appropriate for the unique operation of a police
80 department. Such rules and regulations shall
81 reserve exclusive authority over the
82 disciplinary process and procedures affecting
83 commissioned officers to the civil service
84 commission; however, until such time as the city
85 adopts such rules and regulations, the
86 commissioned personnel shall continue to be
87 governed by the board of police commissioner's
88 rules and regulations in effect immediately
89 prior to the establishment of the municipal
90 police force, with the police chief acting in
91 place of the board of police commissioners for
92 purposes of applying the rules and regulations.
93 Unless otherwise provided for, existing civil
94 service commission rules and regulations
95 governing the appeal of disciplinary decisions
96 to the civil service commission shall apply to
97 all commissioned and civilian personnel. The
98 civil service commission's rules and regulations
99 shall provide that records prepared for
100 disciplinary purposes shall be confidential,
101 closed records available solely to the civil
102 service commission and those who possess
103 authority to conduct investigations regarding
104 disciplinary matters pursuant to the civil
105 service commission's rules and regulations. A
106 hearing officer shall be appointed by the civil
107 service commission to hear any such appeals that
108 involve discipline resulting in a suspension of
109 greater than fifteen days, demotion, or
110 termination, but the civil service commission
111 shall make the final findings of fact,
112 conclusions of law, and decision which shall be
113 subject to any right of appeal under chapter 536.
SB 1414 18
114 9. A city not within a county that
115 establishes and maintains a municipal police
116 force under this section:
117 (1) Shall provide or contract for life
118 insurance coverage and for insurance benefits
119 providing health, medical, and disability
120 coverage for commissioned and civilian personnel

122 as was provided by the board of police

133 commissioners under section 84.160;
134 (3) Shall make available medical and life
135 insurance coverage for purchase to the spouses
136 or dependents of commissioned and civilian

138 of police commissioners or the municipal police
139 force and deceased commissioned and civilian
140 personnel who receive pension benefits under
141 sections 86.200 to 86.366 at the rate that such
142 dependent's or spouse's coverage would cost
143 under the appropriate plan if the deceased were
144 living; and
145 (4) May pay an additional shift
146 differential compensation to commissioned and
147 civilian personnel for evening and night tours
148 of duty in an amount not to exceed ten percent
149 of the officer's base hourly rate.
150 10. A city not within a county that
151 establishes a municipal police force under
152 sections 84.343 to 84.346 shall establish a
153 transition committee of five members for the
154 purpose of: coordinating and implementing the
155 transition of authority, operations, assets, and
156 obligations from the board of police
157 commissioners to the city; winding down the
SB 1414 19
158 affairs of the board; making nonbinding
159 recommendations for the transition of the police
160 force from the board to the city; and other
161 related duties, if any, established by executive
162 order of the city's mayor. Once the ordinance
163 referenced in this section is enacted, the city
164 shall provide written notice to the board of
165 police commissioners and the governor of the
166 state of Missouri. Within thirty days of such
167 notice, the mayor shall appoint three members to
168 the committee, two of whom shall be members of a
169 statewide law enforcement association that
170 represents at least five thousand law
171 enforcement officers. The remaining members of
172 the committee shall include the police chief of
173 the municipal police force and a person who
174 currently or previously served as a commissioner
175 on the board of police commissioners, who shall
176 be appointed to the committee by the mayor of
177 such city.]

8 provisions of sections 84.010 to 84.340 shall
9 not apply to any city not within a county or its
10 municipal police force as of such date. The
11 board shall continue to operate, if necessary,
12 to wind down the board's affairs until the
13 transfer of ownership and obligations under
14 subsection 2 of section 84.344 has been
15 completed. During such time, the board of
16 police commissioners shall designate and
17 authorize its secretary to act on behalf of the
18 board for purposes of performing the board's
19 duties and any other actions incident to the
20 transfer and winding down of the board's affairs.
21 2. For any claim, lawsuit, or other action
22 arising out of actions occurring before the date

40 way in the selection of a police chief or chief
41 of the division created under subsection 8 of

43 4. It shall be the duty of the sheriff for
44 any city not within a county, whenever called
45 upon by the police chief of the municipal police
46 force, to act under the police chief's control
47 for the preservation of the public peace and
48 quiet; and, whenever the exigency or
49 circumstances may, in the police chief's
50 judgment, warrant it, said police chief shall
51 have the power to assume the control and command
52 of all local and municipal conservators of the
53 peace of the city, whether sheriff, constable,
54 policemen or others, and they shall act under
55 the orders of the said police chief and not

SB 1414 21
11 construed as limiting or changing the rights or
12 benefits provided under chapter 86.]
1 [84.347. Notwithstanding the provisions of

3 sections 84.343 to 84.346 shall be
4 nonseverable. If any provision of sections
5 84.343 to 84.346 is for any reason held to be
6 invalid, such decision shall invalidate all of
7 the remaining provisions of this act.]
