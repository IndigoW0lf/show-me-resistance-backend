87 period, in order to equalize the employer and member contribution rates. Otherwise,
88 adjustments in the contribution rates shall be limited by the annual adjustment limits
89 stated in subdivision (6) of this subsection;
90 (5) If the retirement system's funded ratio as of the first day of the preceding
