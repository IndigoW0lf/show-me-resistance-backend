SENATE CONCURRENT RESOLUTION NO. 32
Whereas, the Office of Broadband Development was
established in 2018 as a partnership between the Department
of Economic Development and the Department of Agriculture to
build and strengthen partnerships between public and private
stakeholders and align efforts statewide to improve
broadband access; and
Whereas, the Office of Broadband Development is focused
on addressing broadband availability and noninfrastructure
barriers to full participation in the digital economy in
Missouri by working with providers, communities, and
stakeholders to expand and accelerate broadband deployment
across the state; and
Whereas, in 2021, as part of the bipartisan
Infrastructure Investment and Jobs Act's historic investment
in broadband infrastructure and digital equity, Congress
appropriated more than fourteen billion dollars for the
Affordable Connectivity Program; and
Whereas, Congress assigned the Federal Communications
Commission to administer the Affordable Connectivity Program
(ACP), the successor program to the Emergency Broadband
Benefit, which helped almost nine million households afford
internet access during the pandemic; and
Whereas, under the ACP, eligible households can receive
a discount of up to thirty dollars per month toward internet
services and up to seventy-five dollars per month for
households on qualifying tribal lands; and
Whereas, eligible households may also receive a one-
time discount of up to one hundred dollars to purchase a
laptop, desktop computer, or tablet from participating
providers; and
1
Whereas, currently there are more than four hundred
thousand eligible households within the state of Missouri
that may qualify for the ACP; and
Whereas, based on current take rates, the more than
fourteen billion dollars in funding appropriated for the ACP
could be exhausted in the spring of 2024; and
Whereas, the ACP has been a critical tool in helping
bridge the "digital divide" that exists between those who
have access to modern information and communications
technology and those who do not:
Now, Therefore, Be It Resolved that the members of the
Missouri Senate, One Hundred and Second General Assembly,
Second Regular Session, the House of Representatives
concurring therein, hereby urge each member of the Missouri
congressional delegation to support continued funding of the
ACP so that low-income Missourians can continue to receive
the support they need to participate in the digital
marketplace; and
Be It Further Resolved that the Secretary of the Senate
be instructed to prepare a properly inscribed copy of this
resolution for Speaker of the House of Representatives Mike
Johnson, Senate Majority Leader Chuck Schumer, and the
members of the Missouri congressional delegation.
