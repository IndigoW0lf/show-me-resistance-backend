9 if no district deviates by more than one percent from the ideal population of the district, as
10 measured by dividing the number of districts into the statewide population data being used,
11 except that a district may deviate by up to three percent if necessary to follow political
12 subdivision lines consistent with subdivision (4) of this subsection;
13 (2) Districts shall be established in a manner so as to comply with all requirements of
14 the United States Constitution and applicable federal laws, including, but not limited to, the
15 VotingRightsActof1965(asamended). Thefollowingprinciplesshalltakeprecedenceover
16 any other part of this constitution: no district shall be drawn in a manner which results in a
17 denialorabridgmentof theright ofany citizenof theUnitedStates to voteon accountof race
18 or color; and no district shall be drawn such that members of any community of citizens
19 protected by the preceding clause have less opportunity than other members of the electorate
20 to participate in the political process and to elect representatives of their choice;
21 (3) Subject to the requirements of subdivisions (1) and (2) of this subsection, districts
22 shall be composed of contiguous territory as compact as may be. Areas which meet only at
23 the points of adjoining corners are not contiguous. In general, compact districts are those
24 which are square, rectangular, or hexagonal in shape to the extent permitted by natural or
25 political boundaries;
26 (4) To the extent consistent with subdivisions (1) to (3) of this subsection,
27 communities shall be preserved. Districts shall satisfy this requirement if district lines follow
28 political subdivision lines to the extent possible, using the following criteria, in order of
29 priority. First, each county shall wholly contain as many districts as its population allows.
30 Second, if a county wholly contains one or more districts, the remaining population shall be
31 wholly joined in a single district made up of population from outside the county. If a county
32 does not wholly contain a district, then no more than two segments of a county shall be
33 combined with an adjoining county. Third, split counties and county segments, defined as
34 anypartofthecountythatisinadistrictnotwhollywithinthatcounty,shalleachbeasfewas
35 possible. Fourth, as few municipal lines shall be crossed as possible;
36 (5) Districts shall be drawn in a manner that achieves both partisan fairness and,
37 secondarily, competitiveness, but the standards established by subdivisions (1) to (4) of this
38 subsection shall take precedence over partisan fairness and competitiveness. "Partisan
39 fairness" means that parties shall be able to translate their popular support into legislative
40 representation with approximately equal efficiency. "Competitiveness" means that parties'
41 legislative representation shall be substantially and similarly responsive to shifts in the
42 electorate's preferences.
43 Tothisend,theaverageelectoralperformanceofthetwopoliticalpartiesreceivingthe
44 mostvotesinthethreeprecedinggeneralelectionsforgovernor,forUnitedStatesSenate,and
45 for President of the United States shall be calculated. This index shall be defined as the total
HJR 90 3
46 votes received by each party in the three preceding general elections for governor, for United
47 States Senate, and for President of the United States, divided by the total votes cast for both
48 parties in these elections. Using this index, the total number of wasted votes for each party,
49 summing across all of the districts in the plan shall be calculated. "Wasted votes" are votes
50 cast for a losing candidate or for a winning candidate in excess of the threshold needed for
51 victory. Inanyredistrictingplanandmapoftheproposeddistricts,thedifferencebetweenthe
52 two parties' total wasted votes, divided by the total votes cast for the two parties, shall not
53 exceed fifteen percent.
54 Topromotecompetitiveness,theelectoralperformanceindexshallbeusedtosimulate
55 elections in which the hypothetical statewide vote shifts by one percent, two percent, three
56 percent, four percent, and five percent in favor of each party. The vote in each individual
57 district shall be assumed to shift by the same amount as the statewide vote. In each of these
58 simulated elections, the difference between the two parties' total wasted votes, divided by the
59 total votes cast for the two parties, shall not exceed fifteen percent.
60 (c) Within sixty days after the population of this state is reported to the President for
61 each decennial census of the United States or, in the event that a redistricting plan has been
62 invalidated by a court of competent jurisdiction, within sixty days that such a ruling has been
63 made, the state committee and the congressional district committees of each of the two
64 political parties casting the highest vote for governor at the last preceding general election
65 shall meet and the members of each committee shall nominate, by a majority vote of the
66 electedmembers ofthecommitteepresent,providedthat amajorityoftheelectedmembers is
67 present,membersoftheirparty,residentsinthatdistrict,inthecaseofacongressionaldistrict
68 committee, as nominees for the house independent bipartisan citizens commission. No party
69 shall select more than one nominee from any one state legislative district. The congressional
70 district committees shall each submit to the governor their list of two elected nominees. The
71 state committees shall each submit to the governor their list offive elected nominees. Within
72 thirty days thereafter, the governor shall appoint a house independent bipartisan citizens
73 commissionconsistingofonenomineefromeachlistsubmittedbyeachcongressionaldistrict
74 committee and two nominees from each list submitted by each state committee to redistrict
75 the state into one hundred and sixty-three representative districtsand to establish the numbers
76 and boundaries of said districts. No person shall be appointed to both the house independent
77 bipartisan citizens commission and the senate independent bipartisan citizens commission
78 during the same redistricting cycle.
79 If any committee fails to submit a list within such time, the governor shall appoint a
80 member of his or her own choice from the political party of the committee failing to submit a
81 list, provided that in the case of a congressional district committee failing to submit a list, the
HJR 90 4

141 map into compliance. The supreme court shall have exclusive appellate jurisdiction upon the
142 filing of a notice of appeal within ten days after the judgment has become final.
