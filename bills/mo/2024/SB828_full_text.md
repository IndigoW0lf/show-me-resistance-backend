1 143.1405. 1. This section shall be known and may be
2 cited as the "Back the Blue Act".
3 2. As used in this section, the terms "members of the
4 patrol" and "peace officers" shall have the same meanings as
5 provided under section 43.010, and the term "federal law
6 enforcement officer" shall have the same meaning as provided
7 under 34 U.S.C. Section 50301.
8 3. For all tax years beginning on or after January 1,
9 2025, for purposes of calculating the Missouri taxable
10 income as required under section 143.011, a percentage of
11 the first one hundred thousand dollars of income received by
12 any taxpayer as salary or compensation for his or her
13 services as a member of the patrol, as a peace officer, or
14 as a federal law enforcement officer, to the extent that
15 such income is included in the taxpayer's federal adjusted
16 gross income, may be deducted from the taxpayer's Missouri
17 adjusted gross income to determine such taxpayer's Missouri
18 taxable income. For the purposes of this section, "salary
SB 828 2
19 or compensation" shall not include any retirement benefits.
20 Such income shall be deducted as follows:
21 (1) For any tax year beginning on or after January 1,

31 2028, one hundred percent of such income.
32 4. The department of revenue shall promulgate all
33 rules and regulations necessary for the administration of
34 the provisions of this section. Any rule or portion of a
35 rule, as that term is defined in section 536.010, that is
36 created under the authority delegated in this section shall
37 become effective only if it complies with and is subject to
38 all of the provisions of chapter 536 and, if applicable,
39 section 536.028. This section and chapter 536 are
40 nonseverable, and if any of the powers vested with the
41 general assembly under chapter 536 to review, to delay the
42 effective date, or to disapprove and annul a rule are
43 subsequently held unconstitutional, then the grant of
44 rulemaking authority and any rule proposed or adopted after
45 August 28, 2024, shall be invalid and void.
