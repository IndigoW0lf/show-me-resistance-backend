36 before sale of such vehicle; otherwise the sale shall be voidable at the option of the buyer.
37 4. No scrap metal operator shall acquire or purchase a motor vehicle or parts thereof

93 nonseverable and if any of the powers vested with the general assembly pursuant to chapter
94 536 to review, to delay the effective date, or to disapprove and annul a rule are subsequently
95 held unconstitutional, then the grant of rulemaking authority and any rule proposed or
96 adopted after August 28, 2012, shall be invalid and void.
