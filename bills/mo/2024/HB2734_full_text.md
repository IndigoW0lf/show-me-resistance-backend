61 256.700, and a permit fee approved by the commission not to exceed one thousand dollars.
62 The commission may also require a fee for each site listed on a permit not to exceed four
63 hundred dollars for each site. If mining operations are not conducted at a site for six months
64 or more during any year, the fee for such site for that year shall be reduced by fifty percent.
65 The commission may also require a fee for each acre bonded by the operator pursuant to
66 section444.778nottoexceedtwentydollarsperacre. Ifsuch feeisassessed, theper-acre fee
67 on all acres bonded by a single operator that exceed a total of two hundred acres shall be
68 reduced by fifty percent. In no case shall the total fee for any permit be more than three
69 thousand dollars. Permit and renewal fees shall be established by rule, except for the initial
70 fees as set forth in this subsection, and shall be set at levels that recover the cost of
71 administering and enforcing sections 444.760 to 444.790, making allowances for grants and
72 other sources of funds. The director shall submit a report to the commission and the public
73 each year that describes the number of employees and the activities performed the previous
74 calendar year to administer sections 444.760 to 444.790. For any operator of a gravel mining
75 operation where the annual tonnage of gravel mined by such operator is less than five
76 thousand tons, the total cost of submitting an application shall be three hundred dollars. The
77 issued permit shall be valid from the date of its issuance until the date specified in the mine

13 the administrative hearing commission as provided by sections 640.013 and 621.250.
14 2. Whenever a [surface] mining operation permit provided under section 444.772 is
15 issued, denied, suspended, or revoked by the department of natural resources, any aggrieved
16 person, by petition filed with the administrative hearing commission within thirty days of the
17 decision, may appeal such decision as provided by sections 621.250 and 640.013. For
18 purposes of an appeal, the administrative hearing commission may consider, based on
19 competent and substantial scientific evidence on the record, whether an interested party's
20 health, safety or livelihood will be unduly impaired by the issuance, denial, suspension, or
21 revocationofthepermit. Theadministrativehearingcommissionmayalsoconsider,basedon
22 competent and substantial scientific evidence on the record, whether the operator has
23 demonstrated, during the five-year period immediately preceding the date of the permit
24 application, a pattern of noncompliance at other locations in Missouri that suggests a
25 reasonable likelihood of future acts of noncompliance. In determining whether a reasonable
26 likelihood of noncompliance will exist in the future, the administrative hearing commission
27 may look to past acts of noncompliance in Missouri, but only to the extent they suggest a
28 reasonable likelihood of future acts of noncompliance. Such past acts of noncompliance in
29 Missouri, in and of themselves, are an insufficient basis to suggest a reasonable likelihood of
30 future acts of noncompliance. In addition, such past acts shall not be used as a basis to
31 suggestareasonablelikelihoodoffutureactsofnoncomplianceunlessthenoncompliancehas
32 caused or has the potential to cause, a risk to human health or to the environment, or has
33 caused or has potential to cause pollution, or was knowingly committed, or is defined by the
34 United States Environmental Protection Agency as other than minor. If a hearing petitioner
35 demonstrates or the administrative hearing commission finds either present acts of
36 noncompliance or a reasonable likelihood that the permit seeker or the operations of
37 associated persons or corporations in Missouri will be in noncompliance in the future, such a
38 showing will satisfy the noncompliance requirement in this subsection. In addition, such
39 basis must be developed by multiple noncompliances of any environmental law administered
40 bytheMissouridepartmentofnaturalresourcesatanysinglefacilityinMissourithatresulted

41 in harm to the environment or impaired the health, safety or livelihood of persons outside the
42 facility. For any permit seeker that has not been in business in Missouri for the past five
43 years,theadministrativehearing commissionmay reviewtherecordofnoncomplianceinany
44 state where the applicant has conducted business during the past five years. The
45 administrativehearing commission shall issue a recommendeddecision to the commissionon
46 permit issuance, denial, suspension, or revocation. The commission shall issue its own
47 decision, based on the appeal, for permit issuance, denial, suspension, or revocation. If the
48 commission changes a finding of fact or conclusion of law made by the administrative
49 hearing commission, or modifies or vacates the decision recommended by the administrative
50 hearing commission, it shall issue its own decision, which shall include findings of fact and
51 conclusionsoflaw. Thecommissionshallmailcopiesofitsfinaldecisiontothepartiestothe
52 appeal or their counsel of record. The commission's decision shall be subject to judicial
53 review pursuant to chapter 536, except that the court of appeals district with territorial
54 jurisdiction coextensive with the county where the mine is located or is to be located shall
55 have original jurisdiction. No judicial review shall be available until and unless all
56 administrative remedies are exhausted.
444.786. Any person required by sections 444.760 to 444.790 to have a permit who
2 engages in the mining of minerals without previously securing a permit to do so as prescribed
