41
42 WHEREAS, to have full force and effect, any substantive change to the Constitution
43 of the United States such as a time limit on ratification must be within the text of an

45 Article Vamending procedure– a proposal step and a ratification step; and
46
47 WHEREAS, in the proposal step for the Equal Rights Amendment the time limit on
48 State ratifications was only in the preamble section of the resolution by Congress and not
49 within the text of the amendment presented to states for state approval; and

75 proposal step of Article V; and
76
77 WHEREAS, approximately 203 years later, the Madison Amendment completed the
78 ratification step of Article V through ratification by three-fourths of the States; and
79
80 WHEREAS, in 1992, having met the strict two-step requirements of Article V, the
81 Madison Amendment was published by the Archivist during the Administration of President
82 George H.W. Bush as our 27th Amendment to the Constitution of the United States; and
83
84 WHEREAS, following publication of the Madison Amendment, Congress affirmed
85 the Madison Amendment as our 27th Amendment to the Constitution of the United States;
86 and

88 WHEREAS, as of January 27, 2020, three-fourths of the States have ratified the
89 Equal Rights Amendment; and

102 settle”; and

105 legal dictionary, states that a ratification once done, “cannot be revoked or recalled”; and

108 that ratification is “in toto and for ever”; and
