84 (a) Placed in service on the utility's books; or
85 (b) Retired or abandoned.
86 (5) With respect to a new gas-fired generating facility or a new small modular
87 nuclear generating facility, unless the commission timely elects not to set forth
88 ratemaking principles applicable in the future on the grounds that acquiring a stake in
89 such a generating facility is not reasonable, notwithstanding any other provisions of this
90 chapter to the contrary including, but not limited to, the provisions of section 393.135,
91 the electrical corporation shall be permitted, at its election, to implement a new rate
HB 2541 4
92 adjustment mechanism, to become effective not sooner than three hundred sixty-five
93 days after construction of such a generating facility begins and within thirty days after
94 filing by the electrical corporation, designed to recover the return on one hundred
95 percent of amounts recorded to construction work in progress on the utility's books for
96 the electrical corporation's stake in such a generating facility at the weighted average
97 cost of capital without offset, adjustment, or reduction for any other issue or
98 consideration, provided that such return shall be in lieu of any otherwise applicable
99 allowance for funds used during construction that would have accrued from and after
100 theeffectivedateofsuchrateadjustmentmechanism. Suchrateadjustmentmechanism
101 shall be subject to periodic increases, without adjustment, offset, or reduction for any
102 other issue or consideration, no more frequently than every six months, as construction
103 of the electrical corporation's stake in such a generating facility continues and the
104 balance of construction work in progress grows. Customers shall be charged under
105 such rate adjustment mechanism until such time as new base rates reflecting the
106 electrical corporation's investment in such a generating facility take effect, with such
107 base rates to include carrying costs on any unrecovered portion of such investment at
108 the electrical corporation's weighted average cost of capital as determined in the
109 proceeding setting such base rates between the date such generating facility was placed
110 in service on the electrical corporation's books and the effective date of base rates in
111 such proceeding. Such new rate adjustment mechanism shall be permitted to remain in
112 effect for a period not to exceed six years.
113 (6) As an alternative to the rate adjustment mechanism authorized under
114 subdivision (5) of this subsection for a new gas-fired generating facility or a new small
115 modular nuclear generating facility, unless the commission timely elects not to set forth
116 ratemaking principles applicable in the future on the grounds that acquiring a stake in
117 suchageneratingfacilityisnotreasonable,theelectricalcorporationshallbepermitted,
118 at its election, to implement a new temporary rate, to become effective no later than
119 thirty days after such a generating facility is placed in-service on the utility's books,
120 designed to recover one hundred percent of the depreciation expense and the return on
121 rate base on the electrical corporation's stake in such a generating facility at the
122 electrical corporation's weighted average cost of capital plus applicable federal, state,
123 and local income or excise taxes, and reduced for the effects of accumulated deferred
124 income taxes created by such a generating facility, without adjustment, offset, or
125 reduction for any other issue or consideration. Such rate element shall be permitted to
126 remain in effect for a period not to exceed three hundred sixty-five days. Customers

129 (7) The commission in all proceedings in which the cost of the electrical
130 corporation's stake in the generating facility is considered shall utilize the ratemaking
131 principles and treatment applicable to the generating facility or retired or abandoned
132 generating facility.
133 (8) If the commission fails to issue a determination within one hundred eighty
134 days of the date an application for a determination of ratemaking principles and
135 treatment is filed, the ratemaking principles and treatment proposed by the electrical
136 corporation making such application will be deemed to have been approved by the
137 commission and shall be binding for ratemaking purposes during the useful life of the
138 generating facility, or during the period when the cost of the retired or abandoned
139 generating facility is reflected in customer rates.
140 (9) If the electrical corporation's acquisition of a stake in a generation facility
141 requires a certificate of convenience and necessity under the provisions of subsection 1
142 of section 393.170, the electrical corporation may elect to request such certificate by

158 determination of the commission to notify the commission whether it will acquire a
159 stake in the generating facility or transmission facility, or whether it will retire or
160 abandon the generating facility.
161 6. If the electrical corporation notifies the commission within the one-year
162 period that the electrical corporation will not construct or participate in the
163 construction of the generating or transmission facility, or that it will not retire or
164 abandon the generating facility, the determination of ratemaking principles pursuant to
165 subsection 2 or 3 of this section shall be of no further force or effect, shall have no
HB 2541 6
166 precedential value in any subsequent proceeding, and there shall be no adverse
167 presumption applied in any future proceeding as a result of such notification.
168 7. If the electrical corporation notifies the commission under subsection 5 of this
169 section that it will acquire a stake in a generating facility and subsequently does not, or
170 that it will retire or abandon a generating facility and subsequently does not, it will be
171 required to notify the commission immediately by making a filing in the proceeding it
172 initiated under this section and provide a notification of a change in preferred resource
173 plan consistent with the requirements of 20 CSR 4240-22.080(12) as those requirements
174 exist on December 31, 2023.
