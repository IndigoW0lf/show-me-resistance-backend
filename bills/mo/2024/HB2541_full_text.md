55 3. (1) Prior to acquiring a stake in a generating facility, or prior to retiring or

65 achieved by the electrical corporation in retiring or abandoning such electrical
66 corporation's stake in the generating facility, including, but not limited to, the
67 reasonableness of such retirement or abandonment.
68 (2) Any electrical corporation seeking a determination of ratemaking principles
69 and treatment under subsection 3 of this section shall as a part of its filing describe how
70 its stake in the generating facility is consistent with the electrical corporation's most
71 recent preferred plan as the term "preferred plan" is used under the provisions of
72 Chapter 22 of 20 CSR 4240 as of December 31, 2023.
73 (3) In considering the electrical corporation's preferred plan, the commission

75 facilities from a wide audience of participants willing and able to meet the needs
76 identified under the electrical corporation's preferred plan, and if the plan selected by
77 the electrical corporation is reasonable.
78 (4) Unless the commission determines that the electrical corporation's stake in
79 the generating facility is not reasonable, the commission shall issue an order setting
80 forth the ratemaking principles and treatment that will be applicable to the electrical
81 corporation's stake in the generating facility in all ratemaking proceedings and any
82 securitization proceeding under section 393.1700 respecting the electrical corporation's

84 (a) Placed in service on the utility's books; or
85 (b) Retired or abandoned.
86 (5) With respect to a new gas-fired generating facility or a new small modular
87 nuclear generating facility, unless the commission timely elects not to set forth
88 ratemaking principles applicable in the future on the grounds that acquiring a stake in
89 such a generating facility is not reasonable, notwithstanding any other provisions of this
90 chapter to the contrary including, but not limited to, the provisions of section 393.135,
91 the electrical corporation shall be permitted, at its election, to implement a new rate
HB 2541 4
92 adjustment mechanism, to become effective not sooner than three hundred sixty-five
93 days after construction of such a generating facility begins and within thirty days after
94 filing by the electrical corporation, designed to recover the return on one hundred
95 percent of amounts recorded to construction work in progress on the utility's books for
96 the electrical corporation's stake in such a generating facility at the weighted average
97 cost of capital without offset, adjustment, or reduction for any other issue or
98 consideration, provided that such return shall be in lieu of any otherwise applicable
99 allowance for funds used during construction that would have accrued from and after
100 theeffectivedateofsuchrateadjustmentmechanism. Suchrateadjustmentmechanism
101 shall be subject to periodic increases, without adjustment, offset, or reduction for any
102 other issue or consideration, no more frequently than every six months, as construction
103 of the electrical corporation's stake in such a generating facility continues and the
104 balance of construction work in progress grows. Customers shall be charged under
105 such rate adjustment mechanism until such time as new base rates reflecting the
106 electrical corporation's investment in such a generating facility take effect, with such
107 base rates to include carrying costs on any unrecovered portion of such investment at
108 the electrical corporation's weighted average cost of capital as determined in the
109 proceeding setting such base rates between the date such generating facility was placed
110 in service on the electrical corporation's books and the effective date of base rates in
111 such proceeding. Such new rate adjustment mechanism shall be permitted to remain in
112 effect for a period not to exceed six years.
113 (6) As an alternative to the rate adjustment mechanism authorized under
114 subdivision (5) of this subsection for a new gas-fired generating facility or a new small
115 modular nuclear generating facility, unless the commission timely elects not to set forth
116 ratemaking principles applicable in the future on the grounds that acquiring a stake in
117 suchageneratingfacilityisnotreasonable,theelectricalcorporationshallbepermitted,
118 at its election, to implement a new temporary rate, to become effective no later than
119 thirty days after such a generating facility is placed in-service on the utility's books,
120 designed to recover one hundred percent of the depreciation expense and the return on
121 rate base on the electrical corporation's stake in such a generating facility at the
122 electrical corporation's weighted average cost of capital plus applicable federal, state,
123 and local income or excise taxes, and reduced for the effects of accumulated deferred
124 income taxes created by such a generating facility, without adjustment, offset, or
125 reduction for any other issue or consideration. Such rate element shall be permitted to
126 remain in effect for a period not to exceed three hundred sixty-five days. Customers

129 (7) The commission in all proceedings in which the cost of the electrical
130 corporation's stake in the generating facility is considered shall utilize the ratemaking
131 principles and treatment applicable to the generating facility or retired or abandoned
132 generating facility.
133 (8) If the commission fails to issue a determination within one hundred eighty
134 days of the date an application for a determination of ratemaking principles and
135 treatment is filed, the ratemaking principles and treatment proposed by the electrical
136 corporation making such application will be deemed to have been approved by the
137 commission and shall be binding for ratemaking purposes during the useful life of the
138 generating facility, or during the period when the cost of the retired or abandoned
139 generating facility is reflected in customer rates.
140 (9) If the electrical corporation's acquisition of a stake in a generation facility
141 requires a certificate of convenience and necessity under the provisions of subsection 1
142 of section 393.170, the electrical corporation may elect to request such certificate by
143 filinganapplicationinthesameproceedinginwhichtheapplicationforadetermination
144 of ratemaking principles and treatment is filed. In that event, if the commission fails to
145 issue a determination regarding the application for a certificate of convenience and

147 application shall be deemed to have been approved by the commission and shall be

149 4. In making its determination as to whether acquiring a stake in the generating
150 facilityisreasonableandnecessaryorconvenientforthepublicserviceundersubsection
151 1 of section 393.170, if applicable, the commission shall be guided by the fact that it is in
152 the interest of the state of Missouri for electrical corporations to ensure that they own
153 and operate sufficient generating resources to serve their retail load without undue
154 reliance on any power pool, regional transmission operator or independent system
155 operator market, or other resources not owned or controlled by the electrical
156 corporation.
157 5. The electrical corporation shall have one year from the effective date of the
158 determination of the commission to notify the commission whether it will acquire a
159 stake in the generating facility or transmission facility, or whether it will retire or
160 abandon the generating facility.
161 6. If the electrical corporation notifies the commission within the one-year
162 period that the electrical corporation will not construct or participate in the
163 construction of the generating or transmission facility, or that it will not retire or
164 abandon the generating facility, the determination of ratemaking principles pursuant to
165 subsection 2 or 3 of this section shall be of no further force or effect, shall have no
HB 2541 6
166 precedential value in any subsequent proceeding, and there shall be no adverse
167 presumption applied in any future proceeding as a result of such notification.
168 7. If the electrical corporation notifies the commission under subsection 5 of this
169 section that it will acquire a stake in a generating facility and subsequently does not, or
170 that it will retire or abandon a generating facility and subsequently does not, it will be
171 required to notify the commission immediately by making a filing in the proceeding it
172 initiated under this section and provide a notification of a change in preferred resource
173 plan consistent with the requirements of 20 CSR 4240-22.080(12) as those requirements
174 exist on December 31, 2023.
