81 calendar year and rents it or a different homestead for part of the same year, "property taxes
82 accrued" means only taxes levied on the homestead both owned and occupied by the
83 claimant, multiplied by the percentage of twelve months that such property was owned and
84 occupied as the homestead of the claimant during the year. When a claimant owns and
85 occupies two or more different homesteads in the same calendar year, property taxes accrued
