SENATE RESOLUTION NO. 562
NOTICE OF PROPOSED RULE CHANGE
Notice is hereby given by the Senator from the Twenty-
ninth District of the one day notice required by rule
of intent to put a motion to adopt the following rule
change:
BE IT RESOLVED by the Senate of the One Hundred Second
General Assembly, Second Regular Session, that Senate Rule
50 be amended to read as follows:
"Rule 50. Referrals of bills and appointments to
committee shall be made by the president pro tem; and no
bill shall be considered for final passage unless it has
been reported on by a committee and printed for the use of
the senators. The chair of each committee shall be
authorized to report, and the president pro tem shall
receive, no more than three bills deemed reportable by the
chair of the committee when the senate is on the order of
business of reports of standing committees. The president
pro tem may receive additional bills beyond the three that
the chair is authorized to report at his or her discretion.
A report of all bills recommended "do pass" by a committee
shall be submitted to the senate by the chairman and all
committee amendments accompanying the report shall be
printed in the Journal.
After a bill has been referred to a committee, one-
third of the senators elected has the power to relieve a
committee of further consideration of a bill and place it on
the calendar for consideration. In any case where a
committee has been relieved of further consideration of a
bill as herein provided, a majority of the senators present
but not less than one-third of the senators elected, may, at
any time before final passage thereof, again refer the bill
1
to the same or some other committee for consideration. No
bill or resolution shall be reported adversely by any
committee until the author of the bill or resolution has
been given an opportunity to appear and be heard before the
committee to which it is referred.
One-third of the senators elected may relieve a
committee of an appointment and a motion to grant advice and
consent of the Senate to that appointment is then in order
upon a vote of the majority of the Senate.".
