SECOND REGULAR SESSION
SENATE BILL NO. 1253
102ND GENERA L ASSEMBLY
INTRODUCED BY SENATOR THOMPSON REHDER.
4615S.01I KRISTINA MARTIN, Secretary
AN ACT
To repeal section 34.042, RSMo, and to enact in lieu thereof one new section relating to
competitive bidding.
Be it enacted by the General Assembly of the State of Missouri, as follows:
1 Section A. Section 34.042, RSMo, is repealed and one new
2 section enacted in lieu thereof, to be known as section 34.042,
3 to read as follows:
1 34.042. 1. When the commissioner of administration
2 determines that the use of competitive bidding is either not
3 practicable or not advantageous to the state, supplies may
4 be procured by competitive proposals. The commissioner
5 shall state the reasons for such determination, and a report
6 containing those reasons shall be maintained with the
7 vouchers or files pertaining to such purchases. All
8 purchases in excess of ten thousand dollars to be made under
9 this section shall be based on competitive proposals.
10 2. On any purchase where the estimated expenditure
11 shall be one hundred thousand dollars or over, the
12 commissioner of administration shall:
13 (1) Advertise for proposals in at least two daily
14 newspapers of general circulation in such places as are most
15 likely to reach prospective offerors and may advertise in at
16 least two weekly minority newspapers and may provide such
17 information through an electronic medium available to the
18 general public at least five days before proposals for such
SB 1253 2
19 purchases are to be opened. Other methods of advertisement,
20 however, may be adopted by the commissioner of
21 administration when such other methods are deemed more
22 advantageous for the supplies to be purchased;
23 (2) Post notice of the proposed purchase; and
24 (3) Solicit proposals by mail or other reasonable
25 method generally available to the public from prospective
26 offerors.
27 All proposals for such supplies shall be mailed or delivered
28 to the office of the commissioner of administration so as to
29 reach such office before the time set for opening
30 proposals. Proposals shall be opened in a manner to avoid
31 disclosure of contents to competing offerors during the
32 process of negotiation.
33 3. The contract shall be let to the lowest and best
34 offeror as determined by the evaluation criteria established
35 in the request for proposal and any subsequent negotiations
36 conducted pursuant to this subsection. In determining the
37 lowest and best offeror, as provided in the request for
38 proposals and under rules promulgated by the commissioner of
39 administration, negotiations may be conducted with
40 responsible offerors who submit proposals selected by the
41 commissioner of administration on the basis of reasonable
42 criteria for the purpose of clarifying and assuring full
43 understanding of and responsiveness to the solicitation
44 requirements. Those offerors shall be accorded fair and
45 equal treatment with respect to any opportunity for
46 negotiation and subsequent revision of proposals; however, a
47 request for proposal may set forth the manner for
48 determining which offerors are eligible for negotiation,
49 including, but not limited to, the use of shortlisting.
SB 1253 3
50 Revisions may be permitted after submission and before award
51 for the purpose of obtaining best and final offers. In
52 conducting negotiations there shall be no disclosure of any
53 information derived from proposals submitted by competing
54 offerors. The commissioner of administration shall have the
55 right to reject any or all proposals and advertise for new
56 proposals or purchase the required supplies on the open
57 market if they can be so purchased at a better price.
58 4. The commissioner shall make available, upon
59 request, to any members of the general assembly, information
60 pertaining to competitive proposals, including the names of
61 bidders and the amount of each bidder's offering for each
62 contract.
63 5. If identified in the solicitation, the commissioner
64 may award a contract to the lowest and best responsive
65 vendor as determined by the evaluation criteria set out in
66 the solicitation, while reserving certain contract
67 provisions for negotiation after the notice of award. The
68 reserved contract provisions for post-award negotiation
69 shall not be provisions that were part of the evaluation
70 criteria and scoring or provisions that impacted such
71 criteria or scoring. The timeframe for such post-award
72 negotiations shall be set out in the solicitation itself,
73 and if such negotiations fail, the commissioner may cancel
74 the award and award the contract to the next lowest and best
75 vendor. If satisfied with the lowest and best responsive
76 vendor's proposal, the commissioner may waive post-award
77 negotiations.
