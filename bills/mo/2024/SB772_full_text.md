35 with special consideration given to those organizations and
36 entities that reinvest a minimum of seventy-five percent of
37 the net proceeds to charitable organizations in Missouri,
38 and political subdivisions, including but not limited to,
39 municipalities, counties, and fire protection districts.
40 The director of the department of revenue may promulgate
41 rules and regulations necessary to carry out the provisions
42 of this subsection. Any rule or portion of a rule, as that
43 term is defined in section 536.010, that is created under
44 the authority delegated in this subsection shall become
45 effective only if it complies with and is subject to all of
46 the provisions of chapter 536 and, if applicable, section
47 536.028. This section and chapter 536 are nonseverable and
48 if any of the powers vested with the general assembly
SB 772 3
49 pursuant to chapter 536 to review, to delay the effective
50 date, or to disapprove and annul a rule are subsequently
51 held unconstitutional, then the grant of rulemaking
52 authority and any rule proposed or adopted after August 28,
53 2009, shall be invalid and void.
54 3. All fees collected by a tax-exempt organization may
55 be retained and used by the organization.
56 4. All fees charged shall not exceed those in this
57 section. The fees imposed by this section shall be
58 collected by all permanent offices and all full-time or
59 temporary offices maintained by the department of revenue.
60 5. Any person acting as agent of the department of
61 revenue for the sale and issuance of registrations,

63 shall have an insurable interest in all license plates,
64 licenses, tabs, forms and other documents held on behalf of
65 the department.
66 6. The fees authorized by this section shall not be

69 vehicle dealers authorized to collect and remit sales tax
70 under subsection 10 of section 144.070.
71 7. Notwithstanding any other provision of law to the
72 contrary, the state auditor may audit all records maintained
73 and established by the fee office in the same manner as the
74 auditor may audit any agency of the state, and the
75 department shall ensure that this audit requirement is a
76 necessary condition for the award of all fee office
77 contracts. No confidential records shall be divulged in
78 such a way to reveal personally identifiable information.
79 8. The fees described in subsection 1 of this section
80 shall not be collected from any person who qualifies as a
SB 772 4
81 homeless child or homeless youth, as defined in subsection 1
82 of section 167.020, or as an unaccompanied youth as defined
83 in 42 U.S.C. Section 11434a(6). Such person's status as a
84 homeless child or youth or unaccompanied youth shall be
85 verified by a letter signed by one of the following persons:
86 (1) A director or designee of a governmental or
87 nonprofit agency that receives public or private funding to
88 provide services to homeless persons;
89 (2) A local education agency liaison for homeless

94 legal matter.
1 302.178. 1. Any person between the ages of sixteen
2 and eighteen years who is qualified to obtain a license
3 pursuant to sections 302.010 to 302.340 may apply for, and

5 entitling the applicant, while having such license in his or
6 her possession, to operate a motor vehicle of the
7 appropriate class upon the highways of this state in
8 conjunction with the requirements of this section. An
9 intermediate driver's license shall be readily
10 distinguishable from a license issued to those over the age

12 license shall:
13 (1) Successfully complete the examination required by
14 section 302.173;
15 (2) Pay the fee required by subsection 4 of this
16 section;
SB 772 5

21 the applicant is a participant in a federal residential job

24 stating that the applicant has completed at least forty
25 hours of supervised driving experience under a temporary
26 instruction permit issued pursuant to subsection 1 of
27 section 302.130, or, if the applicant is an emancipated
28 minor, the person over twenty-one years of age who
29 supervised such driving. For purposes of this section, the
30 term "emancipated minor" means a person who is at least
31 sixteen years of age, but less than eighteen years of age,
32 who:
33 (a) Marries with the consent of the legal custodial
34 parent or legal guardian pursuant to section 451.080;

52 points are assessed pursuant to section 302.302, within the
53 preceding six months.
54 2. An intermediate driver's license grants the
55 licensee the same privileges to operate that classification
56 of motor vehicle as a license issued pursuant to section
57 302.177, except that no person shall operate a motor vehicle
58 on the highways of this state under such an intermediate
59 driver's license between the hours of 1:00 a.m. and 5:00
60 a.m. unless accompanied by a person described in subsection
61 1 of section 302.130; except the licensee may operate a
62 motor vehicle without being accompanied if the travel is to
63 or from a school or educational program or activity, a
64 regular place of employment or in emergency situations as
65 defined by the director by regulation.
66 3. Each intermediate driver's license shall be
67 restricted by requiring that the driver and all passengers
68 in the licensee's vehicle wear safety belts at all times.
69 This safety belt restriction shall not apply to a person
70 operating a motorcycle. For the first six months after
71 issuance of the intermediate driver's license, the holder of
72 the license shall not operate a motor vehicle with more than
73 one passenger who is under the age of nineteen who is not a
74 member of the holder's immediate family. As used in this
75 subsection, an intermediate driver's license holder's
76 immediate family shall include brothers, sisters,
77 stepbrothers or stepsisters of the driver, including adopted
78 or foster children residing in the same household of the
79 intermediate driver's license holder. After the expiration
SB 772 7
80 of the first six months, the holder of an intermediate
81 driver's license shall not operate a motor vehicle with more
82 than three passengers who are under nineteen years of age
83 and who are not members of the holder's immediate family.
84 The passenger restrictions of this subsection shall not be
85 applicable to any intermediate driver's license holder who
86 is operating a motor vehicle being used in agricultural work-
87 related activities.
88 4. Notwithstanding the provisions of section 302.177
89 to the contrary, the fee for an intermediate driver's
90 license shall be five dollars and such license shall be
91 valid for a period of two years. Such fee shall be waived
92 for any person qualifying as an emancipated minor under
93 subdivision (4) of subsection 1 of this section.
94 5. Any intermediate driver's licensee accumulating six
95 or more points in a twelve-month period may be required to
96 participate in and successfully complete a driver-
97 improvement program approved by the state highways and
98 transportation commission. The driver-improvement program
99 ordered by the director of revenue shall not be used in lieu
100 of point assessment.
101 6. (1) An intermediate driver's licensee who has, for
102 the preceding twelve-month period, had no alcohol-related
103 enforcement contacts, as defined in section 302.525 and no
104 traffic convictions for which points are assessed, upon
105 reaching the age of eighteen years or within the thirty days
106 immediately preceding their eighteenth birthday may apply
107 for and receive without further examination, other than a
108 vision test as prescribed by section 302.173, a license
109 issued pursuant to this chapter granting full driving
110 privileges. Such person shall pay the required fee for such
111 license as prescribed in section 302.177.
SB 772 8
112 (2) If an intermediate driver's license expires on a
113 Saturday, Sunday, or legal holiday, such license shall
114 remain valid for the five business days immediately
115 following the expiration date. In no case shall a licensee
116 whose intermediate driver's license expires on a Saturday,
117 Sunday, or legal holiday be guilty of an offense of driving
118 with an expired or invalid driver's license if such offense
119 occurred within five business days immediately following an
120 expiration date that occurs on a Saturday, Sunday, or legal
121 holiday.
122 (3) The director of revenue shall deny an application
123 for a full driver's license until the person has had no
124 traffic convictions for which points are assessed for a
125 period of twelve months prior to the date of application for
126 license or until the person is eligible to apply for a six-
127 year driver's license as provided for in section 302.177,
128 provided the applicant is otherwise eligible for full
129 driving privileges. An intermediate driver's license shall
130 expire when the licensee is eligible and receives a full
131 driver's license as prescribed in subdivision (1) of this
132 section.
133 7. No person upon reaching the age of eighteen years
134 whose intermediate driver's license and driving privilege is
135 denied, suspended, cancelled or revoked in this state or any
136 other state for any reason may apply for a full driver's
137 license until such license or driving privilege is fully
138 reinstated. Any such person whose intermediate driver's
139 license has been revoked pursuant to the provisions of
140 sections 302.010 to 302.540 shall, upon receipt of
141 reinstatement of the revocation from the director, pass the
142 complete driver examination, apply for a new license, and
SB 772 9
143 pay the proper fee before again operating a motor vehicle
144 upon the highways of this state.
145 8. A person shall be exempt from the intermediate
146 licensing requirements if the person has reached the age of
147 eighteen years and meets all other licensing requirements.
148 9. Any person who violates any of the provisions of
149 this section relating to intermediate drivers' licenses or
150 the provisions of section 302.130 relating to temporary
151 instruction permits is guilty of an infraction, and no
152 points shall be assessed to his or her driving record for
153 any such violation.
154 10. A person's status as a homeless child or youth or
155 unaccompanied youth under paragraph (f) of subdivision (4)
156 of subsection 1 of this section shall be verified by a
157 letter signed by one of the following persons:
158 (1) A director or designee of a governmental or
159 nonprofit agency that receives public or private funding to
160 provide services to homeless persons;
161 (2) A local education agency liaison for homeless
162 children and youth designated under 42 U.S.C. Section
163 11432(g)(1)(J)(ii), or a school social worker or counselor;
164 or
165 (3) A licensed attorney representing the minor in any
166 legal matter.
167 11. Any rule or portion of a rule, as that term is
168 defined in section 536.010, that is created under the
169 authority delegated in this section shall become effective
170 only if it complies with and is subject to all of the
171 provisions of chapter 536 and, if applicable, section
172 536.028. This section and chapter 536 are nonseverable and
173 if any of the powers vested with the general assembly
174 pursuant to chapter 536 to review, to delay the effective
SB 772 10
175 date or to disapprove and annul a rule are subsequently held
176 unconstitutional, then the grant of rulemaking authority and
177 any rule proposed or adopted after August 28, 2000, shall be
178 invalid and void.
1 302.181. 1. The license issued pursuant to the
2 provisions of sections 302.010 to 302.340 shall be in such
3 form as the director shall prescribe, but the license shall
4 be a card made of plastic or other comparable material. All
5 licenses shall be manufactured of materials and processes
6 that will prohibit, as nearly as possible, the ability to
7 reproduce, alter, counterfeit, forge, or duplicate any
8 license without ready detection. The license shall also
9 bear the expiration date of the license, the classification
10 of the license, the name, date of birth, residence address
11 including the county of residence or a code number
12 corresponding to such county established by the department,
13 and brief description and colored digitized image of the
14 licensee, and a facsimile of the signature of the licensee.
15 The director shall provide by administrative rule the
16 procedure and format for a licensee to indicate on the back
17 of the license together with the designation for an
18 anatomical gift as provided in section 194.240 the name and
19 address of the person designated pursuant to sections
20 404.800 to 404.865 as the licensee's attorney in fact for
21 the purposes of a durable power of attorney for health care
22 decisions. No license shall be valid until it has been so
23 signed by the licensee. If any portion of the license is
24 prepared by a private firm, any contract with such firm
25 shall be made in accordance with the competitive purchasing
26 procedures as established by the state director of the
27 division of purchasing.
SB 772 11
28 2. All digital images produced for licenses shall
29 become the property of the department of revenue.
30 3. The license issued shall be carried at all times by
31 the holder thereof while driving a motor vehicle, and shall
32 be displayed upon demand of any officer of the highway
33 patrol, or any police officer or peace officer, or any other
34 duly authorized person, for inspection when demand is made
35 therefor. Failure of any operator of a motor vehicle to
36 exhibit his or her license to any duly authorized officer
37 shall be presumptive evidence that such person is not a duly
38 licensed operator.
39 4. The director of revenue shall not issue a license
40 without a facial digital image of the license applicant,
41 except as provided pursuant to subsection 7 of this
42 section. A digital image of the applicant's full facial
43 features shall be taken in a manner prescribed by the
44 director. No digital image shall be taken wearing anything
45 which cloaks the facial features of the individual.
46 5. The department of revenue may issue a temporary
47 license or a full license without the photograph or with the
48 last photograph or digital image in the department's records
49 to members of the Armed Forces, except that where such
50 temporary license is issued it shall be valid only until the
51 applicant shall have had time to appear and have his or her
52 picture taken and a license with his or her photograph
53 issued.
54 6. The department of revenue shall issue upon request
55 a nondriver's license card containing essentially the same
56 information and photograph or digital image, except as
57 provided pursuant to subsection 7 of this section, as the
58 driver's license upon payment of six dollars. All
59 nondriver's licenses shall expire on the applicant's
SB 772 12
60 birthday in the sixth year after issuance. A person who has
61 passed his or her seventieth birthday shall upon application
62 be issued a nonexpiring nondriver's license card.
63 Notwithstanding any other provision of this chapter, a
64 nondriver's license containing a concealed carry endorsement
65 shall expire three years from the date the certificate of
66 qualification was issued pursuant to section 571.101, as
67 section 571.101 existed prior to August 28, 2013. The fee
68 for nondriver's licenses issued for a period exceeding three
69 years is six dollars or three dollars for nondriver's
70 licenses issued for a period of three years or less. The
71 nondriver's license card shall be used for identification
72 purposes only and shall not be valid as a license. No fee
73 shall be required or collected from a homeless child or
74 homeless youth, as defined in subsection 1 of section
75 167.020, or unaccompanied youth, as defined in 42 U.S.C.
76 Section 11434a(6), for a first nondriver's license card
77 issued under this subsection. Such person's status as a
78 homeless child or youth or unaccompanied youth shall be
79 verified by a letter signed by one of the following persons:
80 (1) A director or designee of a governmental or
81 nonprofit agency that receives public or private funding to
82 provide services to homeless persons;
83 (2) A local education agency liaison for homeless
84 children and youth designated under 42 U.S.C. Section
85 11432(g)(1)(J)(ii), or a school social worker or counselor;
86 or
87 (3) A licensed attorney representing the minor in any
88 legal matter.
89 7. If otherwise eligible, an applicant may receive a
90 driver's license or nondriver's license without a photograph
91 or digital image of the applicant's full facial features
SB 772 13
92 except that such applicant's photograph or digital image
93 shall be taken and maintained by the director and not
94 printed on such license. In order to qualify for a license
95 without a photograph or digital image pursuant to this
96 section the applicant must:
97 (1) Present a form provided by the department of
98 revenue requesting the applicant's photograph be omitted
99 from the license or nondriver's license due to religious
100 affiliations. The form shall be signed by the applicant and
101 another member of the religious tenant verifying the
102 photograph or digital image exemption on the license or
103 nondriver's license is required as part of their religious
104 affiliation. The required signatures on the prescribed form
105 shall be properly notarized;
106 (2) Provide satisfactory proof to the director that
107 the applicant has been a United States citizen for at least
108 five years and a resident of this state for at least one
109 year, except that an applicant moving to this state
110 possessing a valid driver's license from another state
111 without a photograph shall be exempt from the one-year state
112 residency requirement. The director may establish rules
113 necessary to determine satisfactory proof of citizenship and
114 residency pursuant to this section;
115 (3) Applications for a driver's license or nondriver's
116 license without a photograph or digital image must be made
117 in person at a license office determined by the director.
118 The director is authorized to limit the number of offices
119 that may issue a driver's or nondriver's license without a
120 photograph or digital image pursuant to this section.
121 8. The department of revenue shall make available, at
122 one or more locations within the state, an opportunity for
123 individuals to have their full facial photograph taken by an
SB 772 14
124 employee of the department of revenue, or their designee,
125 who is of the same sex as the individual being photographed,
126 in a segregated location.
127 9. Beginning July 1, 2005, the director shall not
128 issue a driver's license or a nondriver's license for a
129 period that exceeds an applicant's lawful presence in the
130 United States. The director may, by rule or regulation,
131 establish procedures to verify the lawful presence of the
132 applicant and establish the duration of any driver's license
133 or nondriver's license issued under this section.
134 10. (1) Notwithstanding any biometric data
135 restrictions contained in section 302.170, the department of
136 revenue is hereby authorized to design and implement a
137 secure digital driver's license program that allows
138 applicants applying for a driver's license in accordance
139 with this chapter to obtain a secure digital driver's
140 license in addition to the physical card-based license
141 specified in this section.
142 (2) A digital driver's license as described in this
143 subsection shall be accepted for all purposes for which a
144 license, as defined in section 302.010, is used.
145 (3) The department may contract with one or more
146 entities to develop the secure digital driver's license
147 system. The department or entity may develop a mobile
148 software application capable of being utilized through a
149 person's electronic device to access the person's secure
150 digital driver's license.
151 (4) The department shall suspend, disable, or
152 terminate a person's participation in the secure digital
153 driver's license program if:
SB 772 15
154 (a) The person's driving privilege is suspended,
155 revoked, denied, withdrawn, or cancelled as provided in this
156 chapter; or
157 (b) The person reports that the person's electronic
158 device has been lost, stolen, or compromised.
159 11. The director of the department of revenue may
160 promulgate rules as necessary for the implementation of this
161 section. Any rule or portion of a rule, as that term is
162 defined in section 536.010 that is created under the
163 authority delegated in this section shall become effective
164 only if it complies with and is subject to all of the
165 provisions of chapter 536 and, if applicable, section
166 536.028. This section and chapter 536 are nonseverable and
167 if any of the powers vested with the general assembly
168 pursuant to chapter 536 to review, to delay the effective
169 date, or to disapprove and annul a rule are subsequently
170 held unconstitutional, then the grant of rulemaking
171 authority and any rule proposed or adopted after August 28,
172 2020, shall be invalid and void.
