6 percent of the total aggregate agricultural acreage in this
7 state. A sale or transfer of any agricultural land in this
8 state shall be submitted to the director of the department
SB 806 3
9 of agriculture for review in accordance with subsection 3 of

11 Service Form W-9 signed by the purchaser] beginning on the
12 effective date of this section, no alien, foreign business,
13 or foreign government shall acquire by grant, purchase,
14 devise, descent, or otherwise any agricultural land in this
15 state. Any alien, foreign business, or foreign government
16 who acquired any agricultural land in this state prior to

18 otherwise transfer such agricultural land to any other
19 alien, foreign business, or foreign government on or after
20 the effective date of this section. No person may hold
21 agricultural land as an agent, trustee, or other fiduciary
22 for an alien [or], foreign business, or foreign government
23 in violation of sections 442.560 to 442.592, provided,
24 however, that no security interest in such agricultural land
25 shall be divested or invalidated by such violation.
26 2. Any alien [or], foreign business, or foreign
27 government who acquires agricultural land in violation of
28 sections 442.560 to 442.592 remains in violation of sections
29 442.560 to 442.592 for as long as [he or she] the alien,

32 such agricultural land shall be divested or invalidated by
33 such violation.
34 3. Subject to the provisions of subsection 1 of this
35 section, [such] all proposed [acquisitions] transfers on or
36 after the effective date of this section by grant, purchase,
37 devise, descent, or otherwise of any interest in
38 agricultural land held by any alien, foreign business, or
39 foreign government in this state shall be submitted at least
40 thirty calendar days prior to when such transfers of such
SB 806 4
41 agricultural land are finalized to the department of
42 agriculture to determine whether such [acquisition] transfer
43 of agricultural land, or if land usage changes, is conveyed
44 in accordance with the [one percent restriction on the total
45 aggregate] prohibition on alien and foreign ownership of
46 agricultural land in this state under this section. Such
47 sale or transfer submitted for review shall be deemed a
48 closed record under chapter 610 until such sale is
49 finalized. The department shall establish by rule the
50 requirements for submission and approval of requests under
51 this subsection.
52 4. Any rule or portion of a rule, as that term is
53 defined in section 536.010, that is created under the
54 authority delegated in this section shall become effective
55 only if it complies with and is subject to all of the
56 provisions of chapter 536 and, if applicable, section
57 536.028. This section and chapter 536 are nonseverable and
58 if any of the powers vested with the general assembly
59 pursuant to chapter 536 to review, to delay the effective
60 date, or to disapprove and annul a rule are subsequently
61 held unconstitutional, then the grant of rulemaking
62 authority and any rule proposed or adopted after August 28,
63 2014, shall be invalid and void.
1 442.576. 1. If the director finds that an alien [or],
2 foreign business, or foreign government or an agent,
3 trustee, or other fiduciary therefor has acquired
4 agricultural land in Missouri [in violation of sections
5 442.560 to 442.592] after the effective date of this
6 section, or the land ceases to be used for nonagricultural
7 purposes under section 442.591, he or she shall report the
8 violation to the attorney general.
SB 806 5
9 2. The attorney general shall institute an action in
10 the circuit court of Cole County or the circuit court in any
11 county in which agricultural land owned by the alien or
12 foreign business, agent, trustee or other fiduciary, alleged
13 to have violated sections 442.560 to 442.592, is located.
14 3. The attorney general shall file a notice of the
15 pendency of the action with the recorder of deeds of each
16 county in which any portion of such agricultural lands is
17 located. If the court finds that the lands in question have
18 been acquired in violation of sections 442.560 to 442.592,
19 it shall enter an order so declaring and shall file a copy
20 of the order with the recorder of deeds of each county in
21 which any portion of the agricultural lands is located. The
22 court shall order the owner to divest himself of the
23 agricultural land. The owner must comply with the order
24 within two years. The two-year limitation period shall be a
25 covenant running with the title to the land against any
26 alien grantee or assignee. Provided, however, an
27 incorporated foreign business must divest itself of
28 agricultural land within the minimum time required by
29 Article XI, Section 5, of the Missouri Constitution. Any
30 agricultural lands not divested within the time prescribed
31 shall be ordered sold by the court at a public sale in the
32 manner prescribed by law for the foreclosure of a mortgage
33 on real estate for default in payment.
1 442.591. The restrictions set forth in sections
2 442.560 to 442.592 shall not apply to agricultural land or
3 any interest therein acquired by an alien or foreign
4 business for immediate or potential use in nonfarming
5 purposes. An alien or foreign business may hold such
6 agricultural land in such acreage as may be necessary to its
7 nonfarm business operation; provided, however, that pending
SB 806 6
8 the development of agricultural land for nonfarm purposes,
9 such land may not be used for farming except under lease to
10 a family farm unit; a family farm corporation defined in
11 section 350.010; an alien or foreign business which has
12 filed with the director under sections 442.560 to 442.592;
13 or except when controlled through ownership, options,
14 leaseholds or other agreements by a corporation which has
15 entered into an agreement with the United States of America
16 pursuant to the New Community Act of 1968 (Title IV of the
17 Housing and Urban Development Act of 1969, 42 U.S.C. 3901-
18 3914), as amended, or a subsidiary or assignee of such a
19 corporation. As used in this section, the term "nonfarming"
20 includes, but is not limited to, the conducting and active
21 operation of research or experimentation for the purpose of
22 developing or improving any type of agricultural practice,
23 tool, device, or implement, or animal health research,
24 animal nutrition research, raising genetic traits that are
25 used for human or animal research, or animals raised for
26 exhibition.
1 Section B. Because of the dangers of foreign ownership
2 of agricultural land, section A of this act is deemed
3 necessary for the immediate preservation of the public
4 health, welfare, peace, and safety, and is hereby declared
5 to be an emergency act within the meaning of the
6 constitution, and section A of this act shall be in full
7 force and effect upon its passage and approval.
