2 eligibility for each uninterrupted family or medical care
3 leave period by filing a first claim for benefits supported
4 by the certificate of a treating health care provider that
5 establishes the serious health condition of the family
6 member that warrants the care of the employee, or that
7 establishes the serious health condition of the employee.
8 For subsequent periods of uninterrupted leave after the
9 period covered by the initial certificate or any preceding
10 continued claim, a claimant shall file a continued claim for
11 those benefits supported by the certificate of a treating
12 health care provider.
13 (2) For employees seeking leave in order to assume a
14 familial responsibility due to a spouse, child, or parent
15 being on active duty in the uniformed services, eligibility
16 for leave shall be established by providing, in a manner
17 satisfactory to the department, proof of the family member
18 being on active duty.
19 (3) For employees seeking leave due to a serious
20 health condition related to seeking medical attention,

41 certificate shall be within the physician's or health care
42 provider's knowledge and shall be based on a physical
43 examination and documented medical history of the family
44 member or employee. The certificate shall contain all of

61 in subsection 1 of this section for an employee taking leave
62 to bond with a minor child within the first year of the
63 child's birth or placement in connection with foster care or
64 adoption.
65 4. Any claim of an individual who obtains care and
66 treatment outside the state shall be supported by a
67 certificate of a treating health care provider duly licensed
68 or certified by the state or foreign country in which the
69 claimant is receiving care and treatment.
70 5. Nothing in this section shall be construed to
71 preclude the department from requesting additional medical
72 evidence to supplement any claim. Any cost incurred for

74 employee. The department may require that the additional
75 evidence include any or all of the following:

2 advance notice to their employer before family and medical
3 leave is to begin if the need for the leave is foreseeable.
4 If thirty days notice is not practicable, notice shall be
5 given to the employer as soon as practicable.
1 285.420. 1. Except as provided in subsection 4 of
2 this section, an employee may file a notice of appeal from
3 any determination of eligibility for benefits made by the
4 department with the administrative hearing commission
5 pursuant to chapter 621. Such appeal shall be made by mail
6 or in person within thirty days after the date on which a
7 copy of the department's decision was received by the
8 employee.
9 2. The administrative hearing commission's proposed
10 decision and order shall be final and not subject to further
11 appeal, unless within thirty days after the decision is
12 served on the interested parties, a party files a petition
13 for judicial review as provided in chapter 536.
14 3. A determination of the amount of benefits payable
15 under sections 285.400 to 285.440 shall not serve as a basis
16 for appeal under this section. However, the determination
17 shall be subject to request by the employee on family or
18 medical leave for redetermination by the department at any
19 time within one year from the date of delivery or mailing of

SB 1069 22
21 redetermination shall be furnished to the individual in
22 writing.
23 4. A denial of benefits shall become final in the

34 which recovery is provided under this section.
35 6. A redetermination of benefits may be made at any
36 time for any of the following reasons:
37 (1) To conform to a final court decision applicable to
38 either an initial determination or a determination of denial
39 or allowance of benefits;
40 (2) In the event of a back pay award or settlement
41 affecting the allowance of benefits; or
42 (3) In the case of misrepresentation or willful
43 failure to report a material fact.
44 Written notice of any such redetermination shall be promptly
45 given by mail or delivered to such interested parties as
46 were notified of the initial determination of denial or
47 allowance of benefits and any new interested party or
48 parties who, under such rule as the department may adopt,
49 would be an interested party.
1 285.425. 1. Notwithstanding any provision of law to
2 the contrary, it shall be unlawful for any person to
SB 1069 23
3 discharge or in any other manner discriminate against an
4 employee because the employee has made a claim for,
5 indicated an intent to make a claim for, or received
6 Missouri earned family and medical leave benefits.
7 2. (1) Any person who violates the provisions of
8 subsection 1 of this section shall be liable to any employee

19 to the individual, any actual monetary losses sustained by
20 the individual as a direct result of the violation, such as
21 the cost of providing care, up to a sum equal to sixty
22 calendar days of wages or salary for the individual;
23 (b) The interest on the amount described in paragraph
24 (a) of this subdivision, such interest rate being equal to
25 the market rate as determined by the director of the
26 division of finance under section 408.030; and
27 (c) An additional amount as liquidated damages equal
28 to the sum of the amount described in paragraph (a) of this
29 subdivision and the interest described in paragraph (b) of
30 this subdivision, except that if a person who has violated
31 subsection 1 of this section proves to the satisfaction of
32 the court that the act or omission was in good faith and
33 that the person had reasonable grounds for believing that
SB 1069 24
34 the act or omission was not a violation, such court may
35 reduce the amount of such liquidated damages.
36 (2) The court may additionally require reasonable
37 attorney's fees, expert witness fees, and other court costs
38 to be paid by a defendant.
39 3. An action to recover the relief prescribed in

47 department. If any damages are recovered in such action,
48 such damages shall be held in a special deposit account and
49 paid directly to each employee affected.
50 5. An action may be brought under this section not

6 easily explain eligibility requirements, the claims process,
7 weekly benefit amounts, maximum benefits payable, notice and
8 medical certification requirements, reinstatement and
9 nondiscrimination rights, confidentiality, and the
10 relationship between employment protection, leave from
SB 1069 25
11 employment, wage replacement benefits, and other laws,
12 collective bargaining agreements, and employer policies.

7 be a dedicated fund and money in the fund shall be used
8 solely by the department of labor and industrial relations
9 for the purpose of distributing Missouri earned family and
10 medical leave program benefits.
SB 1069 26
11 (2) The state treasurer shall invest moneys in the
12 fund in the same manner as other funds are invested. Any
13 interest and moneys earned on such investments shall be
14 credited to the fund.
15 2. (1) In order to provide funding to implement the
16 provisions of sections 285.400 to 285.440, employees shall
17 contribute one quarter of one percent of their average
18 weekly pay to the Missouri earned family and medical leave

27 fund, the department may, at its discretion, reduce the
28 benefit amount each employee is eligible to receive. If the
29 benefit amount is reduced, each employee shall receive the
30 same percent of his or her average weekly wage.
31 (4) No employee shall receive benefits from the fund
32 until January 1, 2028.

4 become effective only if it complies with and is subject to
5 all of the provisions of chapter 536 and, if applicable,
6 section 536.028. This section and chapter 536 are
7 nonseverable and if any of the powers vested with the
8 general assembly pursuant to chapter 536 to review, to delay
SB 1069 27
9 the effective date, or to disapprove and annul a rule are
10 subsequently held unconstitutional, then the grant of
