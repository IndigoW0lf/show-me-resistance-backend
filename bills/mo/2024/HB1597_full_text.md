4 profiling analysis may be paid restitution. The individual may receive an
5 amount of one hundred dollars per day for each day of postconviction
6 incarceration for the crime for which the individual is determined to be
7 actuallyinnocent. Thepetitionforthepaymentofsaidrestitutionshallbefiled

9 innocent" shall mean:
10 (1) The individual was convicted of a felony for which a final order of
11 release was entered by the court;
12 (2) All appeals of the order of release have been exhausted;
13 (3) Theindividualwasnotservinganytermofasentenceforanyother

16 sentence because his or her parole was revoked by a court or the parole board
17 in connection with the crime for which the person has been exonerated.
18 Regardless of whether any other basis may exist for the revocation of the
19 person's probation or parole at the time of conviction for the crime for which
20 the person is later determined to be actually innocent, when the court's or the

27 any state or federal court, if such person was exonerated on or before August
28 28, 2004, or testing ordered under section 650.055, if such person was or is
29 exonerated after August 28, 2004, demonstrates a person's innocence of the
30 crime for which the person is in custody.

32 Any individual who receives restitution under this section shall be prohibited
33 from seeking any civil redress from the state, its departments and agencies, or
34 any employee thereof, or any political subdivision or its employees. This
35 section shall not be construed as a waiver of sovereign immunity for any
36 purposes other than the restitution provided for herein. The department of
37 corrections shall determine the aggregate amount of restitution owed during a
38 fiscal year. If insufficient moneys are appropriated each fiscal year to pay
39 restitution to such persons, the department shall pay each individual who has
40 received an order awarding restitution a pro rata share of the amount
41 appropriated. Provided sufficient moneys are appropriated to the department,
42 the amounts owed to such individual shall be paid on June thirtieth of each
43 subsequent fiscal year, until such time as the restitution to the individual has
44 been paid in full. However, no individual awarded restitution under this
45 subsection shall receive more than thirty-six thousand five hundred dollars
HB 1597 13
46 during each fiscal year. No interest on unpaid restitution shall be awarded to
47 the individual. No individual who has been determined by the court to be
48 actually innocent shall be responsible for the costs of care under section
49 217.831.
50 2. If the results of the DNA testing confirm the person's guilt, then the
51 person filing for DNA testing under section 547.035, shall:
52 (1) Be liable for any reasonable costs incurred when conducting the
53 DNA test, including but not limited to the cost of the test. Such costs shall be
54 determined by the court and shall be included in the findings of fact and
55 conclusions of law made by the court; and
56 (2) Be sanctioned under the provisions of section 217.262.
57 3. A petition for payment of restitution under this section may only be
58 filed by the individual determined to be actually innocent or the individual's
59 legal guardian. No claim or petition for restitution under this section may be
60 filed by the individual's heirs or assigns. An individual's right to receive
61 restitution under this section is not assignable or otherwise transferrable. The
62 state's obligation to pay restitution under this section shall cease upon the
63 individual's death. Any beneficiary designation that purports to bequeath,
64 assign, or otherwise convey the right to receive such restitution shall be void
65 and unenforceable.
66 4. An individual who is determined to be actually innocent of a crime
67 under this chapter shall automatically be granted an order of expungement
68 from the court in which he or she pled guilty or was sentenced to expunge
69 from all official records all recordations of his or her arrest, plea, trial or
70 conviction. Upon granting of the order of expungement, the records and files
71 maintained in any administrative or court proceeding in an associate or circuit
72 division of the court shall be confidential and only available to the parties or
73 by order of the court for good cause shown. The effect of such order shall be
74 to restore such person to the status he or she occupied prior to such arrest, plea
75 or conviction and as if such event had never taken place. No person as to
76 whomsuch order hasbeen enteredshall be held thereafter under anyprovision
77 of any law to be guilty of perjury or otherwise giving a false statement by
78 reason of his or her failure to recite or acknowledge such arrest, plea, trial,
79 conviction or expungement in response to any inquiry made of him or her for
80 any purpose whatsoever and no such inquiry shall be made for information
81 relating to an expungement under this section.]
