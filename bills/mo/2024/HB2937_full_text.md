3 sole physical custody or any combination thereof;
4 (2) "Joint legal custody" means that the parents share the decision-making rights,
5 responsibilities, and authority relating to the health, education and welfare of the child, and,
6 unless allocated, apportioned, or decreed, the parents shall confer with one another in the
7 exercise of decision-making rights, responsibilities, and authority;
8 (3) "Joint physical custody" means an order awarding each of the parents significant,
9 but not necessarily equal, periods of time during which a child resides with or is under the
10 care and supervision of each of the parents. Joint physical custody shall be shared by the
11 parents in such a way as to assure the child of frequent, continuing and meaningful contact
12 with both parents;
13 (4) "Third-party custody" means a third party designated as a legal and physical
14 custodian pursuant to subdivision (5) of subsection 5 of this section.
15 2. Thecourtshalldeterminecustodyinaccordancewiththebestinterestsofthechild.
16 There shall be a rebuttable presumption that an award of equal or approximately equal
17 parenting time to each parent is in the best interests of the child. Such presumption is
18 rebuttable only by a preponderance of the evidence in accordance with all relevant factors,
19 including,butnotlimitedto,thefactorscontainedinsubdivisions(1)to(8)ofthissubsection.
HB 2937 15
20 The presumption may be rebutted if the court finds that the parents have reached an
21 agreement on all issues related to custody, or if the court finds that a pattern of domestic
22 violence has occurred as set out in subdivision (6) of this subsection. When the parties have
23 not reached an agreement on all issues related to custody, the court shall consider all relevant
24 factors and enter written findings offact and conclusions of law, including, but not limited to,
25 the following:
26 (1) The wishes of the child's parents as to custody and the proposed parenting plan
27 submitted by both parties;
28 (2) Theneeds ofthechildfora frequent,continuingandmeaningfulrelationshipwith
29 both parents and the ability and willingness of parents to actively perform their functions as
30 mother and father for the needs of the child;
31 (3) The interaction and interrelationship of the child with parents, siblings, and any
32 other person who may significantly affect the child's best interests;
33 (4) Which parent is more likely to allow the child frequent, continuing and
34 meaningful contact with the other parent;
35 (5) Thechild'sadjustmenttothechild'shome,school,andcommunity. Thefactthata
36 parent sends his or her child or children to a home school[, as defined in section 167.031,] or
37 family-paced education school shall not be the sole factor that a court considers in
38 determining custody of such child or children;
39 (6) The mental and physical health of all individuals involved, including any history
40 of abuse of any individuals involved. If the court finds that a pattern of domestic violence as
41 defined in section 455.010 has occurred, and, if the court also finds that awarding custody to

51 award custody or unsupervised visitation of a child to a parent if such parent or any person
52 residing with such parent has been found guilty of, or pled guilty to, any of the following
53 offenses when a child was the victim:
54 (a) A felony violation of section 566.030, 566.031, 566.032, 566.060, 566.061,
55 566.062, 566.064, 566.067, 566.068, 566.083, 566.100, 566.101, 566.111, 566.151, 566.203,

70 frequent, continuing and meaningful contact with both parents after the parents have
71 separatedordissolvedtheirmarriageisinthebestinterestofthechild,exceptforcaseswhere
72 the court specifically finds that such contact is not in the best interest of the child, and that it
73 is the public policy of this state to encourage parents to participate in decisions affecting the
74 health, education and welfare of their children, and to resolve disputes involving their
75 childrenamicably through alternative dispute resolution. Inorder to effectuate these policies,
76 the general assembly encourages the court to enter a temporary parenting plan as early as
77 practicable in a proceeding under this chapter, consistent with the provisions of subsection 2
78 ofthis section,and, in sodoing,the courtshall determine thecustody arrangementwhich will
79 best assure both parents participate in such decisions and have frequent, continuing and
80 meaningful contact with their children so long as it is in the best interests of the child.
81 5. Prior to awarding the appropriate custody arrangement in the best interest of the
82 child, the court shall consider each of the following as follows:
83 (1) Joint physical and joint legal custody to both parents, which shall not be denied
84 solely for the reason that one parent opposes a joint physical and joint legal custody award.
85 The residence of one of the parents shall be designated as the address of the child for mailing
86 and educational purposes;
87 (2) Jointphysicalcustodywithonepartygrantedsolelegalcustody. Theresidenceof
88 one of the parents shall be designated as the address of the child for mailing and educational
89 purposes;
90 (3) Joint legal custody with one party granted sole physical custody;
91 (4) Sole custody to either parent; or
92 (5) Third-party custody or visitation:
HB 2937 17
93 (a) When the court finds that each parent is unfit, unsuitable, or unable to be a
94 custodian, or the welfare of the child requires, and it is in the best interests of the child, then
95 custody,temporarycustodyorvisitationmaybeawardedtoapersonrelatedbyconsanguinity
96 oraffinity to the child. If no person related to the child by consanguinity or affinity iswilling
97 to accept custody, then the court may award custody to any other person or persons deemed
98 by the court to be suitable and able to provide an adequate and stable environment for the
99 child. Before the court awards custody, temporary custody or visitation to a third person
100 under this subdivision, the court shall make that person a party to the action;
101 (b) Under the provisions of this subsection, any person may petition the court to
102 intervene as a party in interest at any time as provided by supreme court rule.
103 6. If the parties have not agreed to a custodial arrangement, or the court determines
104 such arrangement is not in the best interest of the child, the court shall include a written
105 finding in the judgment or order based on the public policy in subsection 4 of this section and
106 each of the factors listed in subdivisions (1) to (8) of subsection 2 of this section detailing the
107 specificrelevant factorsthat madeaparticulararrangement inthebest interestofthechild. If
108 a proposed custodial arrangement is rejected by the court, the court shall include a written
109 finding in the judgment or order detailing the specific relevant factors resulting in the
110 rejection of such arrangement.
111 7. Upon a finding by the court that either parent has refused to exchange information
112 with the other parent, which shall include but not be limited to information concerning the
113 health, education and welfare of the child, the court shall order the parent to comply
114 immediately and to pay the prevailing party a sum equal to the prevailing party's cost
115 associated with obtaining the requested information, which shall include but not be limited to
116 reasonable attorney's fees and court costs.
117 8. As between the parents of a child, no preference may be given to either parent in
118 the awarding of custody because of that parent's age, sex, or financial status, nor because of
119 the age or sex of the child. The court shall not presume that a parent, solely because of his or
120 her sex, is more qualified than the other parent to act as a joint or sole legal or physical
121 custodian for the child.
122 9. Any judgment providing for custody shall include a specific written parenting plan
123 setting forth the terms of such parenting plan arrangements specified in subsection 8 of
124 section 452.310. Such plan may be a parenting plan submitted by the parties pursuant to
125 section 452.310 or, in the absence thereof, a plandetermined by the court, but in all cases,the
126 custody plan approved and ordered by the court shall be in the court's discretion and shall be
127 in the best interest of the child.
128 10. After August 28, 2016, every court order establishing or modifying custody or
129 visitation shall include the following language: "In the event of noncompliance with this
HB 2937 18
130 order, the aggrieved party may file a verified motion for contempt. If custody, visitation, or
131 third-party custody is denied or interfered with by a parent or third party without good cause,
132 the aggrieved person may file a family access motion with the court stating the specific facts
133 that constitute a violation of the custody provisions of the judgment of dissolution, legal
134 separation, or judgment of paternity. The circuit clerk will provide the aggrieved party with
135 an explanation of the procedures for filing a family access motion and a simple form for use
136 in filing the family access motion. A family access motion does not require the assistance of
137 legal counsel to prepare and file.".
138 11. No court shall adopt any local rule, form, or practice requiring a standardized or
139 default parenting plan for interim, temporary, or permanent orders or judgments.
140 Notwithstanding any other provision of law to the contrary, a court may enter an interim
141 order in a proceeding under this chapter, provided that the interim order shall not contain any
142 provisions about child custody or a parenting schedule or plan without first providing the
143 parties with notice and a hearing, unless the parties otherwise agree.
144 12. Unless a parent has been denied custody rights pursuant to this section or
145 visitation rights under section 452.400, both parents shall have access to records and
146 information pertaining to a minor child including, but not limited to, medical, dental, and
147 school records. If the parent without custody has been granted restricted or supervised
148 visitation because the court has found that the parent with custody or any child has been the
149 victim of domestic violence, as defined in section 455.010, by the parent without custody, the
150 court may order that the reports and records made available pursuant to this subsection not

155 visitation rights under section 452.400, any judgment of dissolution or other applicable court
156 order shall specifically allow both parents access to such records and reports.
157 13. Except as otherwise precluded by state or federal law, if any individual,
158 professional, public or private institution or organization denies access or fails to provide or
159 disclose any and all records and information, including, but not limited to, past and present
160 dental, medical and school records pertaining to a minor child, to either parent upon the
161 written request of such parent, the court shall, upon its finding that the individual,
162 professional, public or private institution or organization denied such request without good
163 cause, order that party to comply immediately with such request and to pay to the prevailing
164 partyallcostsincurred,including,butnotlimitedto,attorney'sfeesandcourtcostsassociated

168 contained in section 452.340 and applicable supreme court rules in determining an amount
169 reasonable or necessary for the support of the child.
170 15. If the court finds that domestic violence or abuse as defined in section 455.010
171 has occurred, the court shall make specific findings of fact to show that the custody or
172 visitation arrangement ordered by the court best protects the child and the parent or other
173 family or household member who is the victim of domestic violence, as defined in section
174 455.010, and any other children for whom such parent has custodial or visitation rights from
175 any further harm.
