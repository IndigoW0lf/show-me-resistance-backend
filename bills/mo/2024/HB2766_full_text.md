155 January first of the year in which the credit would otherwise be applied, such eligible
156 owner's credit shall be void and any corresponding moneys shall lapse to the state to be
157 credited to the general revenue fund. In the event that the county collector, or the
158 treasurer ex officio collector of the county in counties with a township form of
159 government, determines prior to issuing the credit that the individual is not an eligible
160 owner because the individual did not pay such individual's property tax liability in full
161 for the most recent prior three years, the credit shall be void and any corresponding
162 moneys shall lapse to the state to be credited to the general revenue fund.

168 536 and, if applicable, section 536.028. This section and chapter 536 are nonseverable
169 and if any of the powers vested with the general assembly pursuant to chapter 536 to
170 review, to delay the effective date, or to disapprove and annul a rule are subsequently
171 held unconstitutional, then the grant of rulemaking authority and any rule proposed or
172 adopted after August 28, 2024, shall be invalid and void.
173 (2) Any rule promulgated by the department shall in no way impact, affect,
174 interrupt, or interfere with the performance of the required statutory duties of any
175 county elected official including, but not limited to, the county collector, when
