Be it enacted by the General Assembly of the State of Missouri, as follows:
1 Section A. Chapter 301, RSMo, is amended by adding thereto
2 one new section, to be known as section 301.148, to read as
3 follows:
1 301.148. 1. Notwithstanding any provision of law to
2 the contrary, vehicles eligible for registration under this
3 chapter may, at the option of the registrant, be registered
4 permanently upon the payment of seven times the applicable
5 fees required to register the vehicle annually and
6 presentation of all documentation otherwise required by law
7 to register the vehicle annually.
8 2. The permanent plate or plates and registration fees
9 are vehicle specific. The plate or plates and the
10 registration fees paid are nontransferable and
11 nonrefundable, except those covered under the provisions of
12 section 301.442. Upon the transfer of the title to any
13 vehicle registered in accordance with this section, the
14 registration shall be cancelled and the license plates
15 issued therefor shall be returned to the director of revenue.
16 3. As used in this section, the term "fees" shall
17 include:
SB 1420 2
18 (1) Fees for registering the vehicle in accordance
19 with this chapter;
20 (2) Emblem-use authorization fees, contributions, or
21 donations as specified in this chapter for the issuance of
22 special license plates, which shall be paid to the
23 organization issuing the emblem use authorization statement
24 for the plate or plates unless otherwise specified by law;
25 and
26 (3) Fees collected as compensation for department of
27 revenue fee offices under section 136.055, which shall be
28 paid to the fee office. Fee offices are hereby authorized
29 to collect a fee as compensation in full and for all
30 services rendered, on the basis specified in this section.
31 4. The department of revenue may issue a distinctive
32 registration tab or tabs indicating a vehicle has been
33 permanently registered as specified in this section.
34 5. The department of revenue may promulgate rules as
35 necessary for the implementation of this section. Any rule
36 or portion of a rule, as that term is defined in section
37 536.010, that is created under the authority delegated in
38 this section shall become effective only if it complies with
39 and is subject to all of the provisions of chapter 536 and,
40 if applicable, section 536.028. This section and chapter
41 536 are nonseverable and if any of the powers vested with
42 the general assembly pursuant to chapter 536 to review, to
43 delay the effective date, or to disapprove and annul a rule
44 are subsequently held unconstitutional, then the grant of
45 rulemaking authority and any rule proposed or adopted after
46 August 28, 2024, shall be invalid and void.
