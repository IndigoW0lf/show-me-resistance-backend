16 3. If the court determines that a fiduciary decision was an abuse of the
17 fiduciary’s discretion, thecourt mayorder aremedy authorizedby law, includingunder
18 section 456.10-1001. To place the beneficiaries in the positions the beneficiaries would

34 petition describes the proposed decision, contains sufficient information to inform the
35 beneficiary of the reasons for making the proposed decision and the facts on which the
36 fiduciary relies, and explains how the beneficiary will be affected by the proposed
37 decision, a beneficiary that opposes the proposed decision has the burden to establish
38 that it will result in an abuse of the fiduciary’s discretion.
469.405. 1. [A trustee may adjust between principal and income to the extent the
2 trustee considers necessary if the trustee invests and manages trust assets as a prudent
3 investor, the terms of the trust describe the amount that may or shall be distributed to a
4 beneficiary by referring to the trust's income, and the trustee determines, after applying
5 subsection 1 of section 469.403, that the trustee is unable to comply with subsection 2 of

13 2. If the amount of an estate tax marital deduction or charitable
14 contribution deduction is reduced because a fiduciary deducts an amount paid
15 from principal for income tax purposes instead of deducting it for estate tax
16 purposes, and as a result estate taxes paid from principal are increased and
17 income taxes paid by an estate, trust or beneficiary are decreased, each estate,
18 trust or beneficiary that benefits from the decrease in income tax shall
19 reimburse the principal from which the increase in estate tax is paid. The total
20 reimbursement shall equal the increase in the estate tax to the extent that the
21 principal used to pay the increase would have qualified for a marital deduction
22 or charitable contribution deduction but for the payment. The proportionate
23 share of the reimbursement for each estate, trust or beneficiary whose income
24 taxes are reduced shall be the same as its proportionate share of the total
25 decrease in income tax. An estate or trust shall reimburse principal from
26 income.]
