Be it enacted by the General Assembly of the state of Missouri, as follows:
Section A. Section 393.135, RSMo, is repealed and two new sections enacted in lieu
2 thereof, to be known as sections 393.135 and 393.1250, to read as follows:
393.135. Except as provided in section 393.1250, any charge made or demanded by

6 prohibited.
393.1250. 1. This section shall be known and may be cited as the "Missouri
2 Nuclear Clean Power Act", the purpose of which is to enable the construction of clean
3 baseload electric generating plants. This section shall not apply to clean baseload
4 electric generating plants that are in commercial operation before August 28, 2024.
5 2. As used in this section, the following terms mean:
6 (1) "Clean baseload generating plant", a new nuclear-fueled electric generating
7 facility located in this state that is designed to be operated at six hundred megawatts or
8 less and is intended in whole or in part to serve retail customers of an electrical
9 corporation in Missouri;
10 (2) "Construction work in progress", the electrical corporation's share of all
11 capital costs associated with a clean baseload generating plant or renewable source

HB 1804 2
12 generating facility, which have been incurred but have not been included in the
13 electrical corporation's plant in service, and are recorded in the Federal Energy
14 Regulatory Commission's Uniform System of Accounts Prescribed for Public Utilities
15 and Licensees Subject to the Provisions of the Federal Power Act, Balance Sheet Chart
16 Accounts, as construction work in progress for electric plants in 18 CFR Part 101, or
17 any other account established in the Uniform System of Accounts for the recording of
18 construction work in progress.
19 3. The provisions of section 393.135 shall not apply to a clean baseload
20 generating plant if the plant is rated at six hundred megawatts or less. Before any such
21 construction work begins, an electrical corporation seeking to include construction
22 work in progress in rates shall file with the commission a plan detailing the projected
23 costs of the project and the plan to recover those costs through rates. Costs recovered
24 by an electrical corporation under the provisions of this section are subject to inclusion
25 or exclusion from rates in a ratemaking proceeding pursuant to the commission's
26 authority to determine just and reasonable rates. In addition, the commission may
27 authorize an electrical corporation to make or demand charges for service based in
28 whole or in part on additional amortizations to maintain the electrical corporation's
29 financial ratios that will, in the commission's judgment, better enable the electrical
30 corporation to cost-effectively construct a clean baseload generating plant.
31 4. The commission may promulgate rules to assist in the implementation of this
32 section. Any rule or portion of a rule, as that term is defined in section 536.010, that is
33 created under the authority delegated in this section shall become effective only if it
34 complies with and is subject to all of the provisions of chapter 536 and, if applicable,
35 section 536.028. This section and chapter 536 arenonseverable and if any of the powers
36 vested with the general assembly pursuant to chapter 536 to review, to delay the
37 effective date, or to disapprove and annul a rule are subsequently held unconstitutional,
38 then the grant of rulemaking authority and any rule proposed or adopted after August
39 28, 2024, shall be invalid and void.
