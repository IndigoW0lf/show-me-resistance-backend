10 WHEREAS, anti-abortion centers often trick pregnant people into thinking they
11 received health care when, in fact, they received nothing more than biased "counseling" and,

14 machinery they are not qualified or trained to operate; and

21 their clients as if they were truly health care providers but, because many anti-abortion
