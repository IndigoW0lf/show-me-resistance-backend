AN ACT
To repeal section 192.769, RSMo, relating to mammograms.
Be it enacted by the General Assembly of the State of Missouri, as follows:
1 Section A. Section 192.769, RSMo, is repealed, to read as
2 follows:
1 [192.769. 1. On completion of a
2 mammogram, a mammography facility certified by
3 the United States Food and Drug Administration
4 (FDA) or by a certification agency approved by
5 the FDA shall provide to the patient the
6 following notice:
7 "If your mammogram demonstrates that you
8 have dense breast tissue, which could hide
9 abnormalities, and you have other risk factors
10 for breast cancer that have been identified, you
11 might benefit from supplemental screening tests
12 that may be suggested by your ordering
13 physician. Dense breast tissue, in and of
14 itself, is a relatively common condition.
15 Therefore, this information is not provided to
16 cause undue concern, but rather to raise your
17 awareness and to promote discussion with your
18 physician regarding the presence of other risk
19 factors, in addition to dense breast tissue. A
20 report of your mammography results will be sent
21 to you and your physician. You should contact
22 your physician if you have any questions or
23 concerns regarding this report.".
24 2. Nothing in this section shall be
25 construed to create a duty of care beyond the
26 duty to provide notice as set forth in this
27 section.
28 3. The information required by this
29 section or evidence that a person violated this
30 section is not admissible in a civil, judicial,
31 or administrative proceeding.
32 4. A mammography facility is not required
33 to comply with the requirements of this section
34 until January 1, 2015.]
