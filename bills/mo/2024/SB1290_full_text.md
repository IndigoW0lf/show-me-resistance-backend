102ND GENERA L ASSEMBLY
INTRODUCED BY SENATOR CARTER.
4914S.01I KRISTINA MARTIN, Secretary
AN ACT
To amend chapter 161, RSMo, by adding thereto one new section relating to grants for certain
educational programs offered by public school districts.
Be it enacted by the General Assembly of the State of Missouri, as follows:
1 Section A. Chapter 161, RSMo, is amended by adding thereto
2 one new section, to be known as section 161.390, to read as
3 follows:
1 161.390. 1. For purposes of this section, the term
2 "classical education program" means an educational program
3 that has a goal of educating students through skill
4 development and the cultivation of knowledge. Skills are
5 developed through the liberal arts, and knowledge is
6 cultivated through the sciences. The liberal arts and the
7 sciences represent two distinct but inseparable domains of
8 classical education. Liberal arts encompass two practiced
9 sets of skills: language skills, including grammar, logic,
10 and rhetoric; and mathematical skills, including arithmetic,
11 geometry, music, and astronomy. Historically, a classical
12 education focuses on three bodies of knowledge: the human
13 sciences, including literature, history, and philosophy; the
14 natural sciences, including biology, chemistry, and physics;
15 and the theological sciences, including dogma, ethics, and
16 apologetics.
17 2. Subject to appropriation, the department of
18 elementary and secondary education shall establish the
SB 1290 2
19 "Classical Education Grant Program" pursuant to the
20 provisions of this section.
21 3. (1) There is hereby created in the state treasury
22 the "Classical Education Grant Program Fund". The fund
23 shall consist of any appropriations to such fund and any
24 gifts, bequests, or donations to such fund. The state
25 treasurer shall be custodian of the fund. The department of
26 elementary and secondary education shall administer the
27 fund. In accordance with sections 30.170 and 30.180, the
28 state treasurer may approve disbursements. The fund shall
29 be a dedicated fund and, upon appropriation, moneys in the
30 fund shall be used solely by the department of elementary
31 and secondary education for the purpose of providing grants
32 to eligible school districts to provide classical education
33 programs as specified in this section.
34 (2) Notwithstanding the provisions of section 33.080
35 to the contrary, any moneys remaining in the fund at the end
36 of the biennium shall not revert to the credit of the
37 general revenue fund.
38 (3) The state treasurer shall invest moneys in the
39 fund in the same manner as other funds are invested. Any
40 interest and moneys earned on such investments shall be
41 credited to the fund.
42 4. Subject to appropriation, the department of
43 elementary and secondary education shall award grants from
44 the classical education grant program fund to eligible
45 school districts for the purpose of providing classical
46 education programs. A school district wishing to receive
47 such a grant shall submit an application to the department
48 of elementary and secondary education addressing:
49 (1) A core mission that classical education courses
50 will help achieve;
SB 1290 3
51 (2) A plan that outlines classical education courses
52 and key metrics that will show success;
53 (3) Resources available to the school district and in
54 the community that will assist in creating successful
55 outcomes in classical education; and
56 (4) Resources and support needed to help the school
57 district succeed in implementing classical education courses.
58 5. The department of elementary and secondary
59 education shall promulgate all necessary rules and
60 regulations for the administration of this section. Any
61 rule or portion of a rule, as that term is defined in
62 section 536.010, that is created under the authority
63 delegated in this section shall become effective only if it
64 complies with and is subject to all of the provisions of
65 chapter 536 and, if applicable, section 536.028. This
66 section and chapter 536 are nonseverable and if any of the
67 powers vested with the general assembly pursuant to chapter
68 536 to review, to delay the effective date, or to disapprove
69 and annul a rule are subsequently held unconstitutional,
70 then the grant of rulemaking authority and any rule proposed
71 or adopted after August 28, 2024, shall be invalid and void.
