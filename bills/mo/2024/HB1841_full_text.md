144 entitled to recover any such wages through a complaint filed with the division or

147 any or all of the following:

154 abatement or reduction, any wages of a separated employee; and
155 (c) Additional statutory damages of up to five hundred dollars per plaintiff per

168 all wages or parts thereof, conceded by the employer to be due or owed, leaving to the
169 employee all remedies to which he or she may otherwise be entitled as to any balance
170 that remains outstanding and claimed. The acceptance by an employee of a disputed
171 paycheck shall not constitute a release as to the balance of his or her claim and any
172 release or restrictive endorsement required by an employer as a condition to payment
173 shall be a violation of this chapter and shall be void. However, if the disputed paycheck
174 satisfies the outstanding amount owed by the employer, a release does not constitute a
175 violation.

215 state law, and fails to comply within thirty-five days of when such a court order is
216 entered.
217 (2) Penalties and fees under this section may be sought and recovered in a civil
218 action brought by the department in any circuit court. In any such civil action, the
219 department shall be represented by the attorney general.

221 Enforcement Fund", which shall consist of moneys collected or recovered as fees and

242 deems necessary to comply with this section.
243 11. The division may promulgate all necessary rules and regulations for the
244 administration of this section. Any rule or portion of a rule, as that term is defined in
245 section 536.010, that is created under the authority delegated in this section shall

250 held unconstitutional, then the grant of rulemaking authority and any rule proposed or
251 adopted after August 28, 2024, shall be invalid and void.
