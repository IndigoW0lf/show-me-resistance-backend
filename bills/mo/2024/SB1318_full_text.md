100 the safety and soundness of banks, credit unions, and
101 financial institutions; and facilitate disaster response and
102 recovery efforts to serve essential civil needs and protect
103 the public interest.
104 2. When any property is seized, taken or requisitioned
105 under this section, the circuit court of the county in which
106 the property was taken may, on the application of the owner
107 thereof or on the application of the governor in cases where
108 numerous claims may be filed, appoint three disinterested
109 commissioners in the manner provided by section 523.040 to
110 assess the damages which the owners may have sustained by
111 reason of the appropriation thereof. Upon the application
112 the amount due because of the seizure of property shall be
113 determined in the manner provided in chapter 523 for the
114 determination of damages in case of the exercise of the
115 power of eminent domain.
1 537.295. 1. No agricultural operation or any of its
2 appurtenances shall be deemed to be a nuisance, private or
3 public, by any changed conditions in the locality thereof
4 [after the facility has been in operation for more than one
5 year, when the facility was not a nuisance at the time the
6 operation began. An agricultural operation protected
7 pursuant to the provisions of this section may reasonably
8 expand its operation in terms of acres or animal units
9 without losing its protected status so long as all county,
10 state, and federal environmental codes, laws, or regulations
11 are met by the agricultural operation. Reasonable expansion
12 shall not be deemed a public or private nuisance, provided
13 the expansion does not create a substantially adverse effect
14 upon the environment or creates a hazard to public health
SB 1318 8
15 and safety, or creates a measurably significant difference
16 in environmental pressures upon existing and surrounding
17 neighbors because of increased pollution. Reasonable
18 expansion shall not include complete relocation of a farming
19 operation by the owner within or without the present
20 boundaries of the farming operation; however, reasonable
21 expansion of like kind that presently exists, may occur. If
22 a poultry or livestock operation is to maintain its
23 protected status following a reasonable expansion, the
24 operation must ensure that its waste handling capabilities
25 and facilities meet or exceed minimum recommendations of the
26 University of Missouri extension service for storage,
27 processing, or removal of animal waste], except for those
28 agricultural operations or any of its appurtenances used for
29 production of swine or swine products located within
30 counties of the first classification, including those
31 counties of the first classification with a charter form of
32 government, that unreasonably expand in violation of zoning
33 laws or ordinances. The protected status of an agricultural
34 operation, once acquired, shall be assignable, alienable,
35 and inheritable. The protected status of an agricultural
36 operation, once acquired, shall not be waived by the
37 temporary cessation of farming or by diminishing the size of
38 the operation. The provisions of this section shall not
39 apply whenever a nuisance results from the negligent or
40 improper operation of any such agricultural operation or its
41 appurtenances.
42 2. As used in this section the term "agricultural
43 operation and its appurtenances" includes, but is not
44 limited to, any facility used in the production or
45 processing for commercial purposes of crops, livestock,
SB 1318 9
46 swine, poultry, livestock products, swine products or
47 poultry products.
48 3. The provisions of this section shall not affect or
49 defeat the right of any person, firm or corporation to
50 recover damages for any injuries sustained by it as a result
51 of the pollution or other change in the quantity or quality
52 of water used by that person, firm or corporation for
53 private or commercial purposes, or as a result of any
54 overflow of land owned by or in the possession of any such
55 person, firm or corporation.
56 4. The provisions of this section shall not apply to
57 any nuisance resulting from an agricultural operation
58 located within the limits of any city, town or village on
59 August 13, 1982.
60 5. In any nuisance action brought in which an
61 agricultural operation is alleged to be a nuisance, and
62 which is found to be frivolous by the court, the defendant
63 shall recover the aggregate amount of costs and expenses
64 determined by the court to have been reasonably incurred in
65 his behalf in connection with the defense of such action,
66 together with a reasonable amount for attorneys fees.
