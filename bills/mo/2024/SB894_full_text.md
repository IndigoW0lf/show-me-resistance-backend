1 536.300. 1. Prior to submitting proposed rules for
2 adoption, amendment, revision, or repeal, under this chapter
3 the state agency shall determine whether the proposed
4 rulemaking affects small businesses and, if so, the
5 availability and practicability of less-restrictive
6 alternatives that could be implemented to achieve the same
7 results of the proposed rulemaking. This requirement shall
8 not apply to emergency rulemaking pursuant to section
SB 894 3
9 536.025 or to constitutionally authorized rulemaking
10 pursuant to Article IV, Section 45 of the Missouri
11 Constitution. This requirement shall be in addition to the
12 fiscal note requirement of sections 536.200 to 536.210.
13 2. If the proposed rules affect small businesses, the
14 state agency shall consider creative, innovative, or
15 flexible methods of compliance for small business and
16 prepare a small business impact statement to be submitted to
17 the secretary of state and the joint committee on
18 administrative rules with the proposed rules. [A copy of
19 the proposed rules and the small business impact statement
20 shall also be filed with the board on the same date as they
21 are filed with the secretary of state.] Such business
22 impact statement and proposed rules shall be submitted to
23 the board prior to providing notice for a public hearing.
24 The statement shall provide a reasonable determination of
25 the following:
26 (1) The methods the agency considered or used to
27 reduce the impact on small businesses such as consolidation,
28 simplification, differing compliance, or reporting
29 requirements, less stringent deadlines, performance rather
30 than design standards, exemption, or any other mitigating
31 techniques;
32 (2) How the agency involved small businesses in the
33 development of the proposed rules;
34 (3) The probable monetary costs and benefits to the
35 implementing agency and other agencies directly affected,
36 including the estimated total amount the agency expects to
37 collect from any additionally imposed fees and the manner in
38 which the moneys will be used, if such costs are capable of
39 determination;
SB 894 4
40 (4) A description of the small businesses that will be
41 required to comply with the proposed rules and how they may
42 be adversely affected, except in cases where the state
43 agency has filed a fiscal note that complies with all of the
44 provisions of section 536.205;
45 (5) In dollar amounts, the increase in the level of
46 direct costs, such as fees or administrative penalties, and
47 indirect costs, such as reporting, record keeping,
48 equipment, construction, labor, professional services,
49 revenue loss, or other costs associated with compliance if
50 such costs are capable of determination, except in cases
51 where the state agency has filed a fiscal note that complies
52 with all of the provisions of section 536.205;
53 (6) The business that will be directly affected by,
54 bear the cost of, or directly benefit from the proposed
55 rules;
56 (7) Whether the proposed rules include provisions that
57 are more stringent than those mandated by any comparable or
58 related federal, state, or county standards, with an
59 explanation of the reason for imposing the more-stringent
60 standard.
61 3. Any proposed rule that is required to have a small
62 business impact statement but does not include such a
63 statement shall be invalid and the secretary of state should
64 not publish the rule until such time as the statement is
65 provided. If the state agency determines that its proposed
66 rule does not affect small business, the state agency shall
67 so certify this finding in the transmittal letter to the
68 secretary of state, stating that it has determined that such
69 proposed rule will not have an economic impact on small
70 businesses and the secretary of state shall publish the rule.
SB 894 5
71 4. [Sections 536.300 to 536.310] This section and
72 section 536.020 shall not apply where the proposed rule is
73 being promulgated on an emergency basis, where the rule is
74 federally mandated, or where the rule substantially codifies
75 existing federal or state law. Notwithstanding the
76 provisions of this section, federally mandated regulations
77 are subject to the federal Regulatory Flexibility Act as
78 amended by the Small Business Regulatory and Enforcement
79 Fairness Act of 1996, P.L. 96-354, as amended by P.L.

125 6. (1) Notwithstanding any provision of this section
126 to the contrary, an applicable agency may, by written notice
127 to the regulatory relief office:
SB 894 18
128 (a) Reject an application, provided such rejection
129 occurs within forty-five days after the day on which the
130 applicable agency receives a complete application for
131 review, or within fifty days if an extension has been
132 requested by the applicable agency, if the applicable agency
133 determines, in the applicable agency's sole discretion, that
134 the applicant's offering fails to comply with standards or
135 specifications:
136 a. Required by federal rule or regulation; or
137 b. Previously approved for use by a federal agency; or
138 (b) Reject an application preliminarily approved by
139 the regulatory relief office, if the applicable agency:
140 a. Recommends rejection of the application in the
141 applicable agency's written report submitted pursuant to
142 subdivision (3) of subsection 5 of this section; and
143 b. Provides in the written report submitted pursuant
144 to subdivision (3) of subsection 5 of this section a
145 description of the applicable agency's reasons approval of
146 the application would create a substantial risk of harm to
147 the health or safety of the public, or create unreasonable
148 expenses for taxpayers in the state.
149 (2) If any applicable agency rejects an application on
150 a nonpreliminary basis pursuant to subdivision (1) of this
151 subsection, the regulatory relief office shall not approve
152 the application.

161 each associated written report, the advisory committee shall
162 provide to the sandbox program director the advisory
163 committee's recommendation as to whether the applicant
164 should be admitted as a sandbox participant.
165 (4) As part of the advisory committee's review of each
166 report, the advisory committee shall use criteria used by
167 applicable agencies to evaluate applications.
168 8. The regulatory relief office shall consult with
169 each applicable agency and the advisory committee before
170 admitting an applicant into the sandbox program. Such

173 license or other authorization to the applicant; and
174 (2) The applicable agency has previously investigated,
175 sanctioned, or pursued legal action against the applicant.
176 9. In reviewing an application under this section, the
177 regulatory relief office and applicable agencies shall
178 consider whether:
179 (1) A competitor to the applicant is or has been a
180 sandbox participant and, if so, weigh that as a factor in
181 favor of allowing the applicant to also become a sandbox
182 participant;
183 (2) The applicant's plan will adequately protect
184 consumers from potential harm identified by an applicable
185 agency in the applicable agency's written report;
186 (3) The risk of harm to consumers is outweighed by the
187 potential benefits to consumers from the applicant's
188 participation in the sandbox program; and
189 (4) Certain state laws or regulations that regulate an
190 innovative offering should not be waived or suspended even
SB 894 20
191 if the applicant is approved as a sandbox participant,
192 including applicable anti-fraud or disclosure provisions.

198 sandbox program. Notwithstanding any other provision of
199 this section to the contrary, the regulatory relief office
200 shall not enter into a written agreement with an applicant
201 that exempts the applicant from any income, property, or

204 11. (1) The sandbox program director may deny at his
205 or her sole discretion any application submitted under this
206 section for any reason, including if the sandbox program
207 director determines that the preponderance of evidence
208 demonstrates that suspending or waiving enforcement of a law
209 or regulation would cause significant risk of harm to
210 consumers or residents of the state.
211 (2) If the sandbox program director denies an
212 application submitted under this section, the regulatory
213 relief office shall provide to the applicant a written
214 description of the reasons for not allowing the applicant to
215 become a sandbox participant.
216 (3) The denial of an application submitted under this
217 section shall not be subject to judicial or administrative
218 review.
219 (4) The acceptance or denial of an application
220 submitted under this section may be overridden by an
221 affirmative vote of a two-thirds majority of the advisory
222 committee at the discretion of the advisory committee,
SB 894 21
223 provided such vote shall take place within fifteen business
224 days of the sandbox program director's decision.
225 Notwithstanding any other provision of this section to the
226 contrary, the advisory committee shall not override a
227 rejection made by an applicable agency.
228 (5) The sandbox program director shall deny an
229 application for participation in the sandbox program if the
230 applicant or any person who seeks to participate with the
231 applicant in demonstrating an innovative offering has been
232 convicted, entered into a plea of nolo contendere, or
233 entered a plea of guilty or nolo contendere held in
234 abeyance, for any crime involving significant theft, fraud,
235 or dishonesty if the crime bears a significant relationship
236 to the applicant's or other participant's ability to safely
237 and competently participate in the sandbox program.
238 12. When an applicant is approved for participation in
239 the sandbox program, the sandbox program director shall
240 provide notice of the approval on the department's website.

6 application.
7 2. An innovative offering that is demonstrated within
8 the sandbox program shall only be available to consumers who
SB 894 22
9 are residents of Missouri or of another state. No law or
10 regulation shall be waived or suspended if waiving or
11 suspending such law or regulation would prevent a consumer
12 from seeking restitution in the event that the consumer is
13 harmed.
14 3. Nothing in sections 620.3900 to 620.3930 shall
15 restrict a sandbox participant that holds a license or other

18 authorization.

45 end a sandbox participant's participation in the sandbox
46 program at any time and for any reason, including if the
47 sandbox program director determines that a sandbox
48 participant is not operating in good faith to bring an
49 innovative offering to market; provided, however, that the
50 sandbox program director's decision may be overridden by an
51 affirmative vote of a two-thirds majority of the members of
52 the advisory committee.

11 amendment or repeal of a rule, the agency should
12 indicate this in its response.]
1 [536.323. 1. In addition to the basis for
2 filing a petition provided in section 536.041,
3 any affected small business may file a written
SB 894 33
4 petition with the agency that has adopted rules
5 objecting to all or part of any rule affecting
6 small business on any of the following grounds:
7 (1) The actual effect on small business
8 was not reflected in or significantly exceeded
9 the small business impact statement submitted
10 prior to the adoption of the rules;
11 (2) The small business impact statement
12 did not consider new or significant economic
13 information that reveals an undue impact on
14 small business; or
15 (3) The impacts were not previously
16 considered at the public hearing on the rules.
17 2. For any rule adopted prior to August
18 28, 2005, an affected small business may file a
19 written petition with the agency that adopted
20 the rule objecting to all or part of any rule
21 affecting small business on any of the following
22 grounds:
23 (1) The rule creates an undue barrier to
24 the formation, operation, and expansion of small
25 businesses in a manner that significantly
26 outweighs the rule's benefit to the public;
27 (2) The rule duplicates, overlaps, or
28 conflicts with rules adopted by the agency or
29 any other agency or violates the substantive
30 authority under which the rule was adopted; or
31 (3) The technology, economic conditions,
32 or other relevant factors justifying the purpose
33 for the rule has changed or no longer exist.
34 3. Upon submission of the petition, the
35 agency shall forward a copy of the petition to
36 the board and the joint committee on
37 administrative rules, as required by section
38 536.041, as notification of a petition filed
39 under sections 536.300 to 536.328. The agency
40 shall promptly consider the petition and may
41 seek advice and counsel regarding the petition.
42 Within sixty days after the receipt of the
43 petition, the agency shall determine whether the
44 impact statement or public hearing addressed the
45 actual and significant impact on small
46 business. The agency shall submit a written
47 response of the agency's determination to the
48 board within sixty days of the receipt of the
49 petition. If the agency determines that the
50 petition merits the adoption, amendment, or
51 repeal of a rule, it may initiate proceedings in
52 accordance with the applicable requirements of
53 this chapter.
54 4. If the agency determines that the
55 petition does not merit the adoption, amendment,
56 or repeal of a rule, any affected small business
57 may seek a review of the decision by the board.
58 The board may convene a hearing or by other
59 means solicit testimony that will assist in its
60 determination of whether to recommend that the
SB 894 34
61 agency initiate proceedings in accordance with
62 this chapter. For rules adopted after August
63 28, 2005, the board shall base its
64 recommendations on any of the following reasons:
65 (1) The actual effect on small business
66 was not reflected in or significantly exceeded
67 the impact statement submitted prior to the
68 adoption of the rule;
69 (2) The impact statement did not consider
70 new or significant economic information that
71 reveals an undue impact on small business;
72 (3) Such impacts were not previously
73 considered by the agency; or
74 (4) Such impacts were not previously
75 considered at the public hearing on the rules.
76 5. For rules adopted prior to August 28,
77 2005, the board shall base its recommendations
78 on any of the following reasons:
79 (1) The rules created an undue barrier to
80 the formation, operation, and expansion of small
81 businesses in a manner that significantly
82 outweighs its benefit to the public;
83 (2) The rules duplicate, overlap, or
84 conflict with rules adopted by the agency or any
85 other agency or violate the substantive
86 authority under which the rules were adopted; or
87 (3) The technology, economic conditions,
88 or other relevant factors justifying the purpose
89 for the rules have changed or no longer exist.
90 6. The board shall make an evaluation
91 report to the governor and the general assembly
92 on rulemaking proceedings, comments from small
93 business, and agency response as provided in
94 this section. The governor or general assembly
95 may subsequently take such action in response to
96 the evaluation report and agency response as
97 they find appropriate.]
1 [536.325. 1. The board shall provide to
2 the head of each agency a list of any rules
3 adopted by the agency that affect small business
4 and have generated complaints or concerns,
5 including any rules that the board determines
6 may duplicate, overlap, or conflict with other
7 rules or exceed statutory authority. Within
8 forty-five days after being notified by the
9 board the list of rules adopted, the agency
10 shall submit a written report to the board in
11 response to the complaints or concerns. The
12 agency shall also state whether the agency has
13 considered the continued need for the rules and
14 the degree to which technology, economic
15 conditions, and other relevant factors may have
16 diminished or eliminated the need for
17 maintaining the rules.
18 2. The board may solicit testimony from
19 the public at a public meeting regarding any
SB 894 35
20 report submitted by the agency under this
21 section or section 536.175. The board shall
22 electronically submit an evaluation report to
23 the governor and the general assembly regarding
24 small business comments, agency response, and
25 public testimony on rules in this section and
26 the report shall be maintained on the board's
27 website. The governor and the general assembly
28 may take such action in response to the report
29 as they find appropriate.]
1 [536.328. For any regulation subject to
2 sections 536.300 to 536.328, a small business
3 that is adversely affected or aggrieved by final
4 agency action is entitled to judicial review of
5 agency compliance with the requirements of
6 sections 536.300 to 536.328. Judicial review
7 shall be commenced in the circuit court of the
8 county in which the small business has its
9 primary place of business, or in Cole County.
10 If the small business does not have a primary
11 place of business in the state, proper venue
12 shall be in Cole County. Notwithstanding any
13 provisions of this chapter to the contrary, an
14 affected small business may seek such judicial
15 review during the period beginning on the date
16 the proposed rule becomes final and ending one
17 year later.]
