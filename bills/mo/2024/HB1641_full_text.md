32 court shall immediately appoint an attorney to represent the respondent in the proceeding.
33 The attorney shall visit the respondent at least twenty-four hours prior to the hearing unless
34 the court finds good cause for waiving this requirement. If the attorney finds that the
HB 1641 13
35 respondent is capable of understanding the matter in question or of contributing to the
36 advancement of the respondent's interest, the attorney shall obtain from the respondent all
37 possible aid. If the attorney finds that the respondent is so impaired that the respondent
38 cannot communicate or participate in the proceedings, the attorney shall consider all

61 physician, licensed psychologist, or other professional shall, prior to examination, explain to
62 the respondent in simple language, the following:

64 determine whether the respondent is incapacitated, disabled, partially incapacitated, or
65 partially disabled;
66 (2) That respondent has the right to remain silent;
67 (3) That anything respondent says may be used at the court hearing, and in making
68 the determination of incapacity or disability.
69 7. The court-appointed physician, licensed psychologist, or other professional shall
70 submit a report in writing to the court and to counsel for all parties. It shall not be a valid
71 objection to the review of the report by the court or the attorneys for the parties that the court
HB 1641 14
72 will be responsible for the ultimate determination of incapacity or partial incapacity. If other
73 objections to the report are made by any party, the court may order a hearing for the limited
74 purpose of determining whether the court shall admit the report. The court may allow a
75 reasonable fee for the services rendered by the physician, licensed psychologist, or other
76 professional to be taxed as costs in the proceeding.

103 respondent's essential requirements for food, clothing, shelter, safety, and other care or that
104 the respondent possesses the ability to manage the respondent's financial resources, the court
105 shall deny the petition. On the other hand, if the court finds that the capacity of the
106 respondent to receive and evaluate information or to communicate decisions is impaired to
107 such an extent as to render the respondent incapable of managing some or all of the
108 respondent's essential requirements for food, clothing, shelter, safety or other care so that

123 13. Before appointing a guardian or conservator, the court shall consider whether the
124 respondent's needs may be met without the necessity of the appointment of a guardian or
125 conservator, or both, by a less restrictive alternative including, but not limited to, the

127 (1) Evidence that the respondent has appointed an attorney-in-fact in a durable power

146 manage the respondent's financial resources;
147 (3) Whether the respondent requires placement in a supervised living situation and, if
148 so, the degree of supervision needed;
149 (4) Whether the respondent's financial resources require supervision and, if so, the

154 (7) Whether the respondent retains the right to marry.
155 15. If it is alleged in a petition that an alleged incapacitated or disabled respondent
156 has no guardian or conservator and an emergency exists that presents a substantial risk that
157 serious physical harm will occur to the respondent's person or irreparable damage will occur
158 to the respondent's property because of the respondent's failure or inability to provide for the
159 respondent's essential human needs or to protect the respondent's property, the court may,
160 with notice to such person's attorney, as provided in subsection 4 of this section, and service

171 subsection shall not be employed as alternative to proceedings for the involuntary detention
172 and treatment of a mentally ill person under the provisions of chapter 632. If no petition for
173 guardianship,conservatorship,limitedguardianship,orlimitedconservatorshiphasbeenfiled
174 within the first ninety days following the granting of emergency authority under this section,
175 the court may terminate the authority granted under the emergency letters upon motion of the
176 attorney for the respondent and a finding that doing so would not be manifestly contrary to
177 the respondent's interest.

2 ward and protectee under its jurisdiction for the purpose of determining whether the
3 incapacity or disability may have ceased or changed and to insure that the guardian or

66 guardian ad litem, or both, or ward would suffer, and any other lack of capabilities of
67 the guardian or guardian ad litem, or both, and ward in making its decision on the type
68 of hearing to conduct on the petition.
69 4. The court may as part of its review, in its discretion, order the performance of a

80 report, or evaluation except by court order.
81 6. The court shall not act upon any notice or complaint filed with the court
82 directly or indirectly requesting the court to order a mental status evaluation of the
83 ward without the notice or complaint being signed and notarized under oath by the
84 filing person, official, or entity and upon the court receiving the signed and notarized
85 notice or complaint. Upon the court receiving the signed notarized notice or complaint,
86 the court shall provide the guardian or guardian ad litem, or both, a copy of the notice
87 or complaint and provide the guardian or guardian ad litem, or both, an opportunity to
88 be heard before the court decides whether to order the mental status evaluation. If it

111 responsibilities and duties as required by this chapter or has not acted in the best interests of
112 the ward or protectee, the court may order that a hearing be held and direct that the guardian
113 or conservator appear before the court. In the event that such a hearing is ordered and the
HB 1641 20
114 ward or protectee is not represented by an attorney, the court shall appoint an attorney to
115 represent the ward or protectee in the proceedings. At the conclusion of the hearing, if the
116 court finds that the guardian or conservator is not discharging his or her duties and
117 responsibilities as required by this code or is not acting in the best interests of the ward or
118 protectee, the court shall enter such orders as it deems appropriate under the circumstances.

9 be a successor guardian or conservator, or both, shall not be required to reestablish
10 incapacity or a disability, or both, unless an oral or written objection is made by the
11 person who is being appointed a successor guardian or conservator, or both, because of
12 a substantial change in his or her capacity or disability indicating that the person no
13 longer requires a guardian or conservator, or both. The oral or written objection
