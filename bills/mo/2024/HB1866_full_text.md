85 Denied Applicant

88 11. If at the hearing the person shows he or she is entitled to the requested

91 12. Any person aggrieved by any final judgment rendered by a small claims
92 court in a denial of permit appeal may have a trial de novo as provided in sections
93 512.180 to 512.320.
94 13. Violation of any provision of this section is a class A misdemeanor.
[1.410. 1. Sections 1.410 to 1.485 shall be known and may be cited as
2 the "Second Amendment Preservation Act".
3 2. The general assembly finds and declares that:
4 (1) The general assembly of the state of Missouri is firmly resolved to
5 support and defend the Constitution of the United States against every
6 aggression, whether foreign or domestic, and is duty-bound to oppose every
7 infraction of those principles that constitute the basis of the union of the states
8 because only a faithful observance of those principles can secure the union's
9 existence and the public happiness;
10 (2) Acting through the Constitution of the United States, the people of
11 the several states created the federal government to be their agent in the
12 exercise of a few defined powers, while reserving for the state governments
13 the power to legislate on matters concerning the lives, liberties, and properties
14 of citizens in the ordinary course of affairs;
15 (3) The limitation of the federal government's power is affirmed under
16 Amendment X of the Constitution of the United States, which defines the total
17 scope of federal powers as being those that have been delegated by the people
18 of the several states to the federal government and all powers not delegated to
19 the federal government in the Constitution of the United States are reserved to
20 the states respectively or the people themselves;
21 (4) If the federal government assumes powers that the people did not
22 grant it in the Constitution of the United States, its acts are unauthoritative,
23 void, and of no force;
24 (5) TheseveralstatesoftheUnitedStatesrespecttheproperroleofthe
25 federal government but reject the proposition that such respect requires
26 unlimitedsubmission. If the federal government, created by a compact among
27 the states,were the exclusive or final judge of the extent ofthe powersgranted
28 to it by the states through the Constitution of the United States, the federal
HB 1866 13
29 government's discretion, and not the Constitution of the United States, would
30 necessarily become the measure of those powers. To the contrary, as in all
31 other cases of compacts among powers having no common judge, each party
32 has an equal right to judge for itself as to whether infractions of the compact
33 have occurred, as well as to determine the mode and measure of redress.
34 Although the several states have granted supremacy to laws and treaties made
35 under the powers granted in the Constitution of the United States, such
36 supremacy does not extend to various federal statutes, executive orders,
37 administrative orders, court orders, rules, regulations, or other actions that
38 collect data or restrict or prohibit the manufacture, ownership, or use of
39 firearms, firearm accessories, or ammunition exclusively within the borders of
40 Missouri; such statutes, executive orders, administrative orders, court orders,
41 rules, regulations, and other actions exceed the powers granted to the federal
42 government except to the extent they are necessary and proper for governing
43 and regulating the United States Armed Forces or for organizing, arming, and
44 discipliningmilitiaforcesactivelyemployedintheserviceoftheUnitedStates
45 Armed Forces;
46 (6) Thepeopleof the severalstates have givenCongress the power "to
47 regulate commerce with foreign nations, and among the several states", but
48 "regulating commerce" does not include the power to limit citizens' right to
49 keepandbeararmsindefenseoftheirfamilies,neighbors,persons,orproperty
50 norto dictatewhat sorts of arms and accessories law-abidingMissourians may
51 buy, sell, exchange, or otherwise possess within the borders of this state;
52 (7) The people of the several states have also granted Congress the
53 powers "to lay and collect taxes, duties, imports, and excises, to pay the debts,
54 and provide for the common defense and general welfare of the United States"
55 and "to make all laws which shall be necessary and proper for carrying into
56 execution the powers vested by the Constitution of the United States in the
57 government of the United States, or in any department or office thereof".
58 Theseconstitutionalprovisionsmerelyidentifythemeansbywhichthefederal
59 governmentmayexecuteits limited powers andshall not beconstrued to grant
60 unlimited power because to do so would be to destroy the carefully
61 constructed equilibrium between the federal and state governments.
62 Consequently, the general assembly rejects any claim that the taxing and
63 spending powers of Congress may be used to diminish in any way the right of
64 the people to keep and bear arms;
65 (8) The general assembly finds that the federal excise tax rate on arms
66 and ammunition in effect prior to January 1, 2021, which funds programs
67 under the Wildlife Restoration Act, does not have a chilling effect on the
68 purchase or ownership of such arms and ammunition;
69 (9) The people of Missouri have vested the general assembly with the
70 authority to regulate the manufacture, possession, exchange, and use of
71 firearms within the borders of this state, subject only to the limits imposed by
72 Amendment II of the Constitution of the United States and the Constitution of
73 Missouri; and
74 (10) The general assembly of the state of Missouri strongly promotes
75 responsible gun ownership, including parental supervision of minors in the
76 proper use, storage, and ownership of all firearms; the prompt reporting of
HB 1866 14
77 stolen firearms; and the proper enforcement of all state gun laws. The general
78 assembly of the state of Missouri hereby condemns any unlawful transfer of
79 firearms and the use of any firearm in any criminal or unlawful activity.]
[1.420. The following federal acts, laws, executive orders,
2 administrative orders, rules, and regulations shall be considered
3 infringements on the people's right to keep and bear arms, as guaranteed by
4 Amendment II of the Constitution of the United States and Article I, Section
5 23 of the Constitution of Missouri, within the borders of this state including,
6 but not limited to:
7 (1) Any tax, levy, fee, or stamp imposed on firearms, firearm
8 accessories, or ammunition not common to all other goods and services and
9 that might reasonably be expectedto create a chilling effect on the purchase or
10 ownership of those items by law-abiding citizens;

12 ammunition;
13 (3) Any registration or tracking of the ownership of firearms, firearm
