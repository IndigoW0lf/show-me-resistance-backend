21 accordance with sections 30.170 and 30.180, the state treasurer may approve
22 disbursements. The fund shall be a dedicated fund and, upon appropriation, moneys
23 in this fund shall be used solely for making matching grants for eligible projects as
24 provided in this section.
25 (2) Notwithstanding the provisions of section 33.080 to the contrary, any moneys
26 remaining in the fund at the end of the biennium shall not revert to the credit of the
27 general revenue fund.
28 (3) The state treasurer shall invest moneys in the fund in the same manner as
29 other funds are invested. Any interest and moneys earned on such investments shall be
30 credited to the fund.
31 4. There is hereby created the "School Renovation Projects Matching Grant"
32 program. The general assembly may appropriate amounts to the school renovation
33 projects matching grant fund created in subsection 3 of this section. The department
34 shall not be required to provide moneys for matching grants under this section if no
35 appropriation for such grants is made by the general assembly. The total amount
36 appropriated to such fund in a fiscal year shall not exceed the amount necessary to
37 provide matching grants to assist each school district in completing eligible projects
38 under this section in such fiscal year.
39 5. (1) For the 2024-25 school year and each subsequent school year and subject
40 to the appropriation of moneys to the school renovation projects matching grant fund,
41 each school district may apply to the department for a matching grant of moneys from
42 the school renovation projects matching grant fund to assist such district in completing
43 an eligible project under this section.
44 (2) Applications for such eligible projects shall be made as provided by the
45 department by rule. Each application submitted by a school district shall contain at
46 least information about the eligible project's objectives and methods, the eligible
47 project's estimated total cost and expenditures, an indication that the school district has
48 allocated the necessary moneys to cover the remaining percentage of the eligible
49 project's estimated total cost and expenditures not covered by an approved matching
50 grant award calculated under subsection 6 of this section, and other information
51 required by the department. Such school district shall allocate such moneys from funds
52 distributed from the classroom trust fund to such school district under section 163.043.
53 (3) After reviewing the application, the department shall determine whether the
54 project and application satisfy the necessary requirements of this section and any rules
HB 2093 3
55 promulgated under this section. If the department determines that the project and
56 application satisfy such necessary requirements, the department shall declare the
57 project to be an eligible project under this section, approve the application, approve a
58 matching grant award amount for the eligible project if moneys are available for a
59 matching grant for such school district, and notify the school district of such
60 determination and approvals.

63 the application, deny an approval of a matching grant award, and notify the school
64 district. The notice shall contain at least a description of the reasons for such
65 determination and rejection. A school district may reapply for a matching grant after
66 such rejection upon submitting an amended application addressing the elements of the
67 project or application resulting in the rejection of the initial application.
68 6. Moneys approved for a matching grant award for a school district shall be
69 sixty percent of the estimated total cost and expenditures of the eligible project in the
70 school district's application.
71 7. After an eligible project is completed, the school district shall submit the
72 eligible project's actual total cost and expenditures to the department as an addendum
73 to the school district's initial matching grant application. Upon receipt of such actual
74 total cost and expenditures, the department shall calculate the amount of the matching
75 grant moneys to be awarded to the school district using such eligible project's actual
76 total costs and expenditures and the matching percentage described in subsection 6 of
77 this section and award the matching grant moneys to the school district. No matching
78 grant moneys awarded to a school district shall exceed the school district's applicable
79 percentage of the eligible project's actual total cost and expenditures.

85 9. (1) The department shall assign priority status to a school district that
86 demonstrates the need for school renovation projects in such school district's
87 application and shall award matching grants to school districts demonstrating such
88 need before awarding matching grants to other applicants. An application's priority
89 status shall be determined by each application's rank and priority score as provided in
90 subdivisions (2) and (3) of this subsection.

95 (b) Districts with a cumulative percentage growth in fall membership for the
96 first through the third preceding years in excess of six percent; and
97 (c) Districts with an equalized assessed valuation per pupil that is less than the
98 statewide average equalized assessed valuation per pupil.
99 (3) Within each ranking as described in paragraphs (a) to (c) of subdivision (2)
100 of this subsection and for providing moneys to applicants under each such paragraph,
101 the department shall establish a priority score based on the school district's percentile
102 rank for highest total school levy for all purposes.
103 10. If all eligible projects granted priority status under subsection 9 of this
104 section are funded, additional applications shall be funded, as moneys allow, for other
105 applications in the order that the applications are received by the department.
106 11. The department may promulgate all necessary rules and regulations for the
107 administration of this section. Any rule or portion of a rule, as that term is defined in
108 section 536.010, that is created under the authority delegated in this section shall
109 become effective only if it complies with and is subject to all of the provisions of chapter
110 536 and, if applicable, section 536.028. This section and chapter 536 are nonseverable
111 and if any of the powers vested with the general assembly pursuant to chapter 536 to
112 review, to delay the effective date, or to disapprove and annul a rule are subsequently
113 held unconstitutional, then the grant of rulemaking authority and any rule proposed or
114 adopted after August 28, 2024, shall be invalid and void.

118 by an act of the general assembly;
119 (2) If such program is reauthorized, the program authorized under this section
120 shall automatically sunset twelve years after the effective date of the reauthorization of
121 this section; and
122 (3) This section shall terminate on September first of the calendar year
123 immediately following the calendar year in which the program authorized under this
124 section is sunset.
