150 between the charter school and the college or university for
151 purposes of teacher training and staff development,

160 tenths percent of the amount of state and local funding
161 allocated to the charter school under section 160.415, not
162 to exceed one hundred twenty-five thousand dollars, adjusted
163 for inflation. The department of elementary and secondary

168 each charter school it sponsors, including appropriate

201 [14.] 12. No sponsor shall grant a charter under
202 sections 160.400 to 160.425 and 167.349 without ensuring

204 registry check are conducted for all members of the
205 governing board of the charter schools or the incorporators
SB 1006 8
206 of the charter school if initial directors are not named in
207 the articles of incorporation, nor shall a sponsor renew a
208 charter without ensuring a criminal background check and

210 member of the governing board of the charter school.
211 [15.] 13. No member of the governing board of a
212 charter school shall hold any office or employment from the

216 with the board. No board member shall be an employee of a
217 company that provides substantial services to the charter
218 school. All members of the governing board of the charter
219 school shall be considered decision-making public servants
220 as defined in section 105.450 for the purposes of the

223 [16.] 14. A sponsor shall develop the policies and
224 procedures for:
225 (1) The review of a charter school proposal including

227 rigorous evaluation of the proposed charter and provides
228 clear documentation that the education program and academic
229 program are aligned with the state standards and grade-level
230 expectations, and provides clear documentation of effective
231 governance and management structures, and a sustainable
232 operational plan;
233 (2) The granting of a charter;
234 (3) The performance contract that the sponsor will use
235 to evaluate the performance of charter schools. Charter
236 schools shall meet current state academic performance
SB 1006 9
237 standards as well as other standards agreed upon by the
238 sponsor and the charter school in the performance contract;
239 (4) The sponsor's intervention, renewal, and
240 revocation policies, including the conditions under which
241 the charter sponsor may intervene in the operation of the

244 end of the term, consistent with subsections 8 and 9 of
245 section 160.405;
246 (5) Additional criteria that the sponsor will use for
247 ongoing oversight of the charter; and
248 (6) Procedures to be implemented if a charter school
249 should close, consistent with the provisions of subdivision
250 (15) of subsection 1 of section 160.405.
251 The department shall provide guidance to sponsors in
252 developing such policies and procedures.
253 [17.] 15. (1) A sponsor shall provide timely
254 submission to the state board of education of all data
255 necessary to demonstrate that the sponsor is in material
256 compliance with all requirements of sections 160.400 to
257 160.425 and section 167.349. The state board of education
258 shall ensure each sponsor is in compliance with all
259 requirements under sections 160.400 to 160.425 and 167.349
260 for each charter school sponsored by any sponsor. The state
261 board shall notify each sponsor of the standards for
262 sponsorship of charter schools, delineating both what is
263 mandated by statute and what best practices dictate. The
264 state board shall evaluate sponsors to determine compliance
265 with these standards every three years. The evaluation
266 shall include a sponsor's policies and procedures in the
267 areas of charter application approval; required charter
SB 1006 10
268 agreement terms and content; sponsor performance evaluation
269 and compliance monitoring; and charter renewal,
270 intervention, and revocation decisions. Nothing shall
271 preclude the department from undertaking an evaluation at
272 any time for cause.
273 (2) If the department determines that a sponsor is in
274 material noncompliance with its sponsorship duties, the
275 sponsor shall be notified and given reasonable time for
276 remediation. If remediation does not address the compliance
277 issues identified by the department, the commissioner of
278 education shall conduct a public hearing and thereafter
279 provide notice to the charter sponsor of corrective action
280 that will be recommended to the state board of education.
281 Corrective action by the department may include withholding
282 the sponsor's funding and suspending the sponsor's authority
283 to sponsor a school that it currently sponsors or to sponsor
284 any additional school until the sponsor is reauthorized by
285 the state board of education under section 160.403.
286 (3) The charter sponsor may, within thirty days of
287 receipt of the notice of the commissioner's recommendation,
288 provide a written statement and other documentation to show
289 cause as to why that action should not be taken. Final
290 determination of corrective action shall be determined by
291 the state board of education based upon a review of the
292 documentation submitted to the department and the charter
293 sponsor.
294 (4) If the state board removes the authority to
295 sponsor a currently operating charter school under any
296 provision of law, the Missouri charter public school
297 commission shall become the sponsor of the school.
298 [18.] 16. If a sponsor notifies a charter school of
299 closure under subsection 8 of section 160.405, the
SB 1006 11
300 department of elementary and secondary education shall
301 exercise its financial withholding authority under
302 subsection 12 of section 160.415 to assure all obligations
303 of the charter school shall be met. The state, charter
304 sponsor, or resident district shall not be liable for any
305 outstanding liability or obligations of the charter school.
1 160.422. 1. Any city not within a county shall not
2 adopt, enforce, impose, or administer an ordinance, local
3 policy, or local resolution that prohibits property sold,
4 leased, or transferred by the city not within a county from
5 being used for any lawful educational purpose by a charter
6 school.
7 2. Any city not within a county shall not impose,
8 enforce, or apply any deed restriction that expressly, or by
9 its operation, prohibits property sold, leased, or
10 transferred by the city not within a county from being used
11 for any lawful educational purpose by a charter school. Any
12 deed restriction or affirmative use deed restriction that
13 affirmatively allows for only one or more specified uses or
14 purposes that do not include any educational use or purpose
15 is prohibited under this section. Any deed restriction or
16 affirmative use deed restriction in effect on the effective
17 date of this section that prohibits or does not permit
18 property previously used for any educational purpose from
19 being used for any future educational purpose is void.
20 3. If any city not within a county offers property of
21 the city not within a county for sale, lease, or rent, the
22 city not within a county shall not refuse to sell, lease, or
23 rent the property to a charter school solely because the
24 charter school intends to use the property for an
25 educational purpose, if the intent of the charter school is
26 to use the property for a lawful educational purpose. If
SB 1006 12
27 the city not within a county offers property of the city not
28 within a county for sale, lease, or rent, the city not
29 within a county is not required to sell, lease, or rent the
30 property to a charter school solely because the charter
31 school intends to use the property for an educational
32 purpose.
33 4. Any ordinance, policy, regulation, deed, or
34 contract made in violation of this section shall be void
35 from its inception.

SB 1006 15
1 160.518. 1. Consistent with the provisions contained
2 in section 160.526, the state board of education shall
3 develop, modify, and revise, as necessary, a statewide
4 assessment system that [provides maximum flexibility for
5 local school districts to determine the degree to which
6 students in the public schools of the state are proficient
7 in the knowledge, skills, and competencies adopted by such
8 board pursuant to section 160.514. The statewide assessment
9 system shall assess problem solving, analytical ability,
10 evaluation, creativity, and application ability in the
11 different content areas and shall be performance-based to
12 identify what students know, as well as what they are able
13 to do, and shall enable teachers to evaluate actual academic
14 performance. The statewide assessment system shall neither
15 promote nor prohibit rote memorization and shall not include
16 existing versions of tests approved for use pursuant to the
17 provisions of section 160.257, nor enhanced versions of such
18 tests. After the state board of education adopts and
19 implements academic performance standards as required under
20 section 161.855, the state board of education shall develop
21 and adopt a standardized assessment instrument under this
22 section based on the academic performance standards adopted

24 shall measure, where appropriate by grade level, a student's
25 knowledge of academic subjects including, but not limited
26 to, reading skills, writing skills, mathematics skills,
27 world and American history, forms of government, geography
28 and science] satisfies the pupil testing mandates in effect
29 under the federal Every Student Succeeds Act (P.L. 114-95),
30 as amended, for each school year. Results from assessments
31 created under this subsection shall be used only for the
32 purpose of compliance with the requirements of such federal
SB 1006 16
33 law and for no other purpose except for determining
34 performance districts under sections 163.011 and 163.031.
35 Results from such assessments shall not be used to classify
36 school districts and charter schools. As permitted by
37 federal law, the state board of education shall ensure that
38 standardized summative assessments are administered to the
39 minimum extent practicable while still appropriately and
40 effectively assessing the academic achievement of students.
41 2. [The statewide assessment system shall only permit
42 the academic performance of students in each school in the
43 state to be tracked against prior academic performance in
44 the same school] School districts and charter schools shall
45 create local assessment systems in conjunction with
46 teachers, administrators, students, parents, and the
47 community to reflect a complete picture of student
48 learning. The local assessments shall be reflective of
49 statewide academic standards and connected to a rich
50 curriculum and shall evaluate student learning accordingly.
51 3. [The state board of education shall suggest, but
52 not mandate, criteria for a school to demonstrate that its
53 students learn the knowledge, skills and competencies at
54 exemplary levels worthy of imitation by students in other
55 schools in the state and nation. Exemplary levels shall be
56 measured by the statewide assessment system developed
57 pursuant to subsection 1 of this section, or until said
58 statewide assessment system is available, by indicators
59 approved for such use by the state board of education. The
60 provisions of other law to the contrary notwithstanding, the
61 commissioner of education may, upon request of the school
62 district, present a plan for the waiver of rules and
63 regulations to any such school, to be known as "Outstanding
64 Schools Waivers", consistent with the provisions of
SB 1006 17
65 subsection 4 of this section] School districts and charter
66 schools shall create local assessments and assessment
67 systems that are:
68 (1) Authentic to student discipline-specific learning,
69 experience, and the demonstration of performance-based
70 learning;
71 (2) Related to curriculum taught in the school;
72 (3) Evaluated and graded in a manner that provides the
73 student with meaningful feedback that can be used for
74 academic improvement;
75 (4) Developed by teachers in consultation with school
76 administrators, students, parents, and the community; and
77 (5) Available for demonstration and community
78 inspection.
79 4. [For any school that meets the criteria established
80 by the state board of education for three successive school
81 years pursuant to the provisions of subsection 3 of this
82 section, by August first following the third such school
83 year, the commissioner of education shall present a plan to
84 the superintendent of the school district in which such
85 school is located for the waiver of rules and regulations to
86 promote flexibility in the operations of the school and to
87 enhance and encourage efficiency in the delivery of
88 instructional services. The provisions of other law to the
89 contrary notwithstanding, the plan presented to the
90 superintendent shall provide a summary waiver, with no
91 conditions, for the pupil testing requirements pursuant to
92 section 160.257, in the school. Further, the provisions of
93 other law to the contrary notwithstanding, the plan shall
94 detail a means for the waiver of requirements otherwise
95 imposed on the school related to the authority of the state
96 board of education to classify school districts pursuant to
SB 1006 18
97 subdivision (9) of section 161.092 and such other rules and
98 regulations as determined by the commissioner of education,
99 excepting such waivers shall be confined to the school and
100 not other schools in the district unless such other schools
101 meet the criteria established by the state board of
102 education consistent with subsection 3 of this section and
103 the waivers shall not include the requirements contained in
104 this section and section 160.514. Any waiver provided to
105 any school as outlined in this subsection shall be void on
106 June thirtieth of any school year in which the school fails
107 to meet the criteria established by the state board of
108 education consistent with subsection 3 of this section]
109 Local assessments and assessment systems shall be developed
110 by teachers and school administrators working individually,
111 in grade teams, in discipline teams, and including the
112 community, including parents and students. School districts
113 and charter schools are encouraged to support communities of
114 practice and provide the time and resources necessary to
115 create these assessments.
116 5. [The score on any assessment test developed
117 pursuant to this section or this chapter of any student for
118 whom English is a second language shall not be counted until
119 such time as such student has been educated for three full
120 school years in a school in this state, or in any other
121 state, in which English is the primary language.
122 6.] The state board of education shall identify or, if
123 necessary, establish one or more developmentally appropriate
124 alternate assessments for students who receive special
125 educational services, as that term is defined pursuant to
126 section 162.675. In the development of such alternate
127 assessments, the state board shall establish an advisory
128 panel consisting of a majority of active special education
SB 1006 19
129 teachers residing in Missouri and other education
130 professionals as appropriate to research available
131 assessment options. The advisory panel shall attempt to
132 identify preexisting developmentally appropriate alternate
133 assessments but shall, if necessary, develop alternate
134 assessments and recommend one or more alternate assessments
135 for adoption by the state board. The state board shall
136 consider the recommendations of the advisory council in
137 establishing such alternate assessment or assessments. Any
138 student who receives special educational services, as that
139 term is defined pursuant to section 162.675, shall be
140 assessed by an alternate assessment established pursuant to
141 this subsection upon a determination by the student's
142 individualized education program team that such alternate
143 assessment is more appropriate to assess the student's
144 knowledge, skills and competencies than the assessment
145 developed pursuant to subsection 1 of this section. The
146 alternate assessment shall evaluate the student's
147 independent living skills, which include how effectively the
148 student addresses common life demands and how well the
149 student meets standards for personal independence expected
150 for someone in the student's age group, sociocultural
151 background, and community setting.
152 [7.] 6. The state board of education shall also
153 develop recommendations regarding alternate assessments for
154 any military dependent who relocates to Missouri after the
155 commencement of a school term, in order to accommodate such
156 student while ensuring that he or she is proficient in the
157 knowledge, skills, and competencies adopted under section
158 160.514.
1 160.522. 1. [The department of elementary and
2 secondary education shall produce or cause to be produced,
SB 1006 20
3 at least annually, a school accountability report card for
4 each public school district, each public school building in
5 a school district, and each charter school in the state.
6 The report card shall be designed to satisfy state and
7 federal requirements for the disclosure of statistics about
8 students, staff, finances, academic achievement, and other
9 indicators. The purpose of the report card shall be to
10 provide educational statistics and accountability
11 information for parents, taxpayers, school personnel,
12 legislators, and the print and broadcast news media in a
13 standardized, easily accessible form] School districts and
14 charter schools shall provide public reporting of
15 information on an annual basis as provided in this section.

48 school currently has a state-approved gifted education
49 program, and the percentage and number of students who are
50 currently being served in the district's or charter school's
51 state-approved gifted education program.
52 3. The report card shall permit the disclosure of data
53 on a school-by-school basis, but the reporting shall not be
54 personally identifiable to any student or education
55 professional in the state.
56 4. [The report card shall identify each school or
57 attendance center that has been identified as a priority
58 school under sections 160.720 and 161.092. The report also
59 shall identify attendance centers that have been categorized
60 under federal law as needing improvement or requiring
61 specific school improvement strategies.
62 5.] The report card shall not limit or discourage
63 other methods of public reporting and accountability by
64 local school districts and charter schools. Districts and
65 charter schools shall provide information included in the
66 report card to parents, community members, and the print and
SB 1006 22
67 broadcast news media[, and legislators] by December first
68 annually or as soon thereafter as the information is

70 preference to methods that incorporate the reporting into
71 substantive official communications such as student report
72 cards. The school district or charter school shall provide
73 a printed copy of the district-level or school-level report
74 card to any patron upon request and shall make reasonable
75 efforts to supply businesses such as, but not limited to,
76 real estate and employment firms with copies or other
77 information about the reports so that parents and businesses
78 from outside the district who may be contemplating
79 relocation have access.
80 [6.] 5. For purposes of completing and distributing
81 the annual report card as prescribed in this section, a
82 school district may include the data from a charter school
83 located within such school district, provided the local
84 board of education or special administrative board for such
85 district and the charter school reach mutual agreement for
86 the inclusion of the data from the charter schools [and the
87 terms of such agreement are approved by the state board of
88 education]. The charter school shall not be required to be a
89 part of the local educational agency of such school district
90 and may maintain a separate local educational agency status.
