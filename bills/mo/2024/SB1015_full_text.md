AN ACT
To repeal section 301.469, RSMo, and to enact in lieu thereof one new section relating to Missouri
conservation heritage foundation license plates.
Be it enacted by the General Assembly of the State of Missouri, as follows:
1 Section A. Section 301.469, RSMo, is repealed and one new
2 section enacted in lieu thereof, to be known as section 301.469,
3 to read as follows:
1 301.469. 1. Any vehicle owner may receive license
2 plates as prescribed in this section, for any motor vehicle
3 such person owns, either solely or jointly, other than an
4 apportioned motor vehicle or a commercial motor vehicle
5 licensed in excess of twenty-four thousand pounds gross
6 weight, after an annual payment of an emblem-use
7 authorization fee to the Missouri conservation heritage
8 foundation. The foundation hereby authorizes the use of its
9 official emblems to be affixed on multiyear license plates
10 as provided in this section. Any vehicle owner may annually
11 apply for the use of the emblems.
12 2. Upon annual application and payment of a twenty-
13 five dollar emblem-use authorization fee to the Missouri
14 conservation heritage foundation, the foundation shall issue
15 to the vehicle owner, without further charge, an emblem-use
16 authorization statement, which shall be presented to the
17 director of the department of revenue at the time of
18 registration of a motor vehicle.
EXPLANATION-Matter enclosed in bold-faced brackets [thus] in this bill is not enacted
and is intended to be omitted in the law.
SB 1015 2
19 3. Upon presentation of the annual statement, payment
20 of a fifteen dollar fee in addition to the regular
21 registration fees and documents which may be required by
22 law, the director of the department of revenue shall issue a
23 license plate, which shall bear an emblem of the Missouri
24 conservation heritage foundation in a form prescribed by the
25 director, to the vehicle owner. Such license plates shall
26 be made with fully reflective material with a common color
27 scheme and design, shall be clearly visible at night, and
28 shall be aesthetically attractive, as prescribed by section
29 301.130. Notwithstanding the provisions of section 301.144,
30 no additional fee shall be charged for the personalization
31 of license plates pursuant to this section.
32 4. Application for the emblem-use authorization and
33 payment of the twenty-five-dollar contribution may also be
34 made at the time of registration to the director of the
35 department of revenue, who shall deposit the contribution to
36 the credit of the Missouri conservation heritage foundation.
37 5. A vehicle owner, who was previously issued a plate
38 with a Missouri conservation heritage foundation emblem
39 authorized by this section but who does not provide an
40 emblem-use authorization statement at a subsequent time of
41 registration, shall be issued a new plate which does not
42 bear the foundation emblem, as otherwise provided by law.
43 [5.] 6. The director of the department of revenue may
44 promulgate rules and regulations for the administration of
45 this section. Any rule or portion of a rule, as that term
46 is defined in section 536.010, that is promulgated under the
47 authority delegated in this section shall become effective
48 only if it has been promulgated pursuant to the provisions
49 of chapter 536. All rulemaking authority delegated prior to
50 August 28, 1999, is of no force and effect; however, nothing
SB 1015 3
51 in this section shall be interpreted to repeal or affect the
52 validity of any rule filed or adopted prior to August 28,
53 1999, if it fully complied with the provisions of chapter
54 536. This section and chapter 536 are nonseverable and if
55 any of the powers vested with the general assembly pursuant
56 to chapter 536 to review, to delay the effective date, or to
57 disapprove and annul a rule are subsequently held
58 unconstitutional, then the grant of rulemaking authority and
59 any rule proposed or adopted after August 28, 1999, shall be
60 invalid and void.
