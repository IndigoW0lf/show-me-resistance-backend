39 minimum prison terms:
40 (1) If the offender has one previous prison commitment
41 to the department of corrections for a felony offense, the
42 minimum prison term which the offender must serve shall be
43 forty percent of his or her sentence or until the offender
44 attains seventy years of age, and has served at least thirty
45 percent of the sentence imposed, whichever occurs first;
46 (2) If the offender has two previous prison
47 commitments to the department of corrections for felonies
48 unrelated to the present offense, the minimum prison term
49 which the offender must serve shall be fifty percent of his

73 other consecutive sentences for offenses committed at or
74 near the same time which is over seventy-five years shall be
75 calculated to be seventy-five years.

77 prison term" shall mean time required to be served by the
78 offender before he or she is eligible for parole,
79 conditional release or other early release by the department
80 of corrections.

82 to, a felony offense other than those offenses listed in

85 under subsection 2 of this section, and shall be eligible
86 for parole, conditional release, or other early release by
87 the department of corrections according to the rules and
88 regulations of the department.

108 among the various circuit courts with respect to the length
109 of sentences imposed and the use of probation for offenders
110 convicted of the same or similar offenses and with similar
111 criminal histories. The commission shall also study and
112 examine whether and to what extent sentencing disparity
113 among economic and social classes exists in relation to the
114 sentence of death and if so, the reasons therefor, if
SB 1426 5
115 sentences are comparable to other states, if the length of
116 the sentence is appropriate, and the rate of rehabilitation
117 based on sentence. It shall compile statistics, examine
118 cases, draw conclusions, and perform other duties relevant
119 to the research and investigation of disparities in death
120 penalty sentencing among economic and social classes.
121 (3) The commission shall study alternative sentences,
122 prison work programs, work release, home-based
123 incarceration, probation and parole options, and any other
124 programs and report the feasibility of these options in
125 Missouri.
126 (4) The governor shall select a chairperson who shall
127 call meetings of the commission as required or permitted
128 pursuant to the purpose of the sentencing commission.
129 (5) The members of the commission shall not receive
130 compensation for their duties on the commission, but shall
131 be reimbursed for actual and necessary expenses incurred in
132 the performance of these duties and for which they are not
133 reimbursed by reason of their other paid positions.
134 (6) The circuit and associate circuit courts of this
135 state, the office of the state courts administrator, the
136 department of public safety, and the department of
137 corrections shall cooperate with the commission by providing
138 information or access to information needed by the
139 commission. The office of the state courts administrator
140 will provide needed staffing resources.
141 8. Courts shall retain discretion to lower or exceed
142 the sentence recommended by the commission as otherwise
143 allowable by law, and to order restorative justice methods,
144 when applicable.
145 9. If the imposition or execution of a sentence is
146 suspended, the court may order any or all of the following
SB 1426 6
147 restorative justice methods, or any other method that the
148 court finds just or appropriate:
149 (1) Restitution to any victim or a statutorily created
150 fund for costs incurred as a result of the offender's
151 actions;
152 (2) Offender treatment programs;
153 (3) Mandatory community service;
154 (4) Work release programs in local facilities; and
155 (5) Community-based residential and nonresidential
156 programs.
157 10. Pursuant to subdivision (1) of subsection 9 of
158 this section, the court may order the assessment and payment
159 of a designated amount of restitution to a county law
160 enforcement restitution fund established by the county
161 commission pursuant to section 50.565. Such contribution
162 shall not exceed three hundred dollars for any charged
163 offense. Any restitution moneys deposited into the county
164 law enforcement restitution fund pursuant to this section
165 shall only be expended pursuant to the provisions of section
166 50.565.
167 11. A judge may order payment to a restitution fund
168 only if such fund had been created by ordinance or
169 resolution of a county of the state of Missouri prior to
170 sentencing. A judge shall not have any direct supervisory
171 authority or administrative control over any fund to which
172 the judge is ordering a person to make payment.
173 12. A person who fails to make a payment to a county
174 law enforcement restitution fund may not have his or her
175 probation revoked solely for failing to make such payment
176 unless the judge, after evidentiary hearing, makes a finding
177 supported by a preponderance of the evidence that the person
178 either willfully refused to make the payment or that the
SB 1426 7
179 person willfully, intentionally, and purposefully failed to
180 make sufficient bona fide efforts to acquire the resources
181 to pay.
182 13. Nothing in this section shall be construed to
183 allow the sentencing advisory commission to issue
184 recommended sentences in specific cases pending in the
185 courts of this state.
