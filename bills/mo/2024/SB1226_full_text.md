9 (2) The general assembly recognizes the necessity for
10 anticipating and making advance provisions to care for the
11 unusual and extraordinary burdens imposed by disasters or
12 emergencies on this state, its political subdivisions, and

SB 1226 4
14 the intention of the general assembly to confer emergency
15 powers on the governor, acting through the director, and
16 vesting the governor with adequate power and authority
17 within the limitation of available funds in the Missouri
18 disaster fund to meet any such emergency or disaster.
19 2. There is hereby established a fund to be known as
20 the "Missouri Disaster Fund", to which the general assembly
21 may appropriate funds and from which funds may be
22 appropriated annually to the state emergency management
23 agency. The funds appropriated shall be expended during a
24 state emergency at the direction of the governor and upon
25 the issuance of an emergency declaration which shall set
26 forth the emergency, or the designation of a disaster area
27 as defined in section 44.010, and shall state that it
28 requires the expenditure of public funds to furnish
29 immediate aid and relief. The director of the state
30 emergency management agency shall administer the fund.
31 3. Expenditures may be made upon direction of the
32 governor for emergency management, as defined in section
33 44.010, or to implement the state disaster plans.
34 Expenditures may also be made to meet the matching
35 requirements of state and federal agencies for any
36 applicable assistance programs.
37 4. Assistance may be provided from the Missouri
38 disaster fund to political subdivisions of this state and
39 rural electric cooperatives that have suffered from a
40 disaster to such an extent as to impose a severe financial
41 burden exceeding the ordinary reserve capacity of the
42 subdivision or rural electric cooperative affected.
43 Applications for aid under this section shall be made to the
44 state emergency management agency on such forms as may be
45 prescribed and furnished by the agency, which forms shall
SB 1226 5
46 require the furnishing of sufficient information to
47 determine eligibility for aid and the extent of the
48 financial burden incurred. The agency may call upon other
49 agencies of the state in evaluating such applications. The
50 director of the state emergency management agency shall
51 review each application for aid under the provisions of this
52 section and recommend its approval or disapproval, in whole
53 or in part, to the governor. If approved, the governor
54 shall determine and certify to the director of the state
55 emergency management agency the amount of aid to be
56 furnished. The director of the state emergency management
57 agency shall thereupon issue the director's voucher to the
58 commissioner of administration, who shall issue the
59 commissioner's warrants therefor to the applicant.
60 5. When a disaster or emergency has been proclaimed by
61 the governor or there is a national emergency, the director
62 of the state emergency management agency, upon order of the
63 governor, shall have authority to expend funds for the

79 reimbursement in whole or in part from such agencies,

81 health threat to the population;
82 (i) In accordance with rules or regulations, provide
83 that all law enforcement authorities and other emergency

110 thereof or on the application of the governor in cases where
111 numerous claims may be filed, appoint three disinterested
112 commissioners in the manner provided by section 523.040 to
113 assess the damages which the owners may have sustained by
114 reason of the appropriation thereof. Upon the application
115 the amount due because of the seizure of property shall be
