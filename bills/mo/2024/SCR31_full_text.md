SENATE CONCURRENT RESOLUTION NO. 31
Whereas, pursuant to Article I, Section 10 of the
United States Constitution, the states retain the sovereign
power to defend themselves when "actually invaded, or in
such imminent danger as will not admit delay"; and
Whereas, the Governor of this state is the commander in
chief of the militia; and
Whereas, as commander in chief of the militia, the
Governor is permitted to call out the militia to execute
laws, suppress insurrection, and repel invasion; and
Whereas, the United States Congressional Budget Office
has estimated that during the 2023 fiscal year, nearly one
million people illegally entered the United States, nearly
equaling the total amount for the previous two fiscal years
combined; and
Whereas, this increase in illegal entry into the United
States has coincided with the rampant increase in crime and
drug trafficking in this state; and
Whereas, action is necessary by the Governor to protect
the interests of the state and the health and safety of all
Missourians from the dangers implicit in the illegal entry
of aliens into this country and state:
Now, Therefore, Be It Resolved by the members of the
Missouri Senate, One Hundred Second General Assembly, Second
Regular Session, the House of Representatives concurring
therein, hereby urge the Governor of Missouri, Michael L.
Parson, to use all powers available to him to repel the
invasion of all immigrants illegally present in this state
to the nearest port of entry in the United States; and
1
Be It Further Resolved that the Secretary of Missouri
Senate be instructed to prepare a properly inscribed copy of
this resolution for the Governor of Missouri.
