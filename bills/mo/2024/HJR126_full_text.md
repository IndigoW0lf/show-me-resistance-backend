9 personal, not held for private or corporate profit and used exclusively for religious worship,
10 for schools and colleges, for purposes purely charitable, for agricultural and horticultural
11 societies, or for veterans' organizations may be exempted from taxation by general law. In
12 additiontotheabove,householdgoods,furniture,wearingapparelandarticlesofpersonaluse
13 and adornment owned and used by a person in his home or dwelling place may be exempt
14 from taxation by general law but any such law may provide for approximate restitution to the
15 respective political subdivisions of revenues lost by reason of the exemption. All laws
16 exempting from taxation property other than the property enumerated in this article, shall be
17 void. The provisions of this section exempting certain personal property of manufacturers,
18 refiners,distributors,wholesalers,andretailmerchantsandestablishmentsfromtaxationshall
19 become effective, unless otherwise provided by law, in each county on January 1 of the year
20 in which that county completes its first general reassessment as defined by law.
21 2. All revenues lost because of the exemption of certain personal property of
22 manufacturers, refiners, distributors, wholesalers, and retail merchants and establishments
23 shall be replaced to each taxing authority within a county from a countywide tax hereby
24 imposed on all property in subclass 3 of class 1 in each county. For the year in which the
25 exemption becomes effective, the county clerk shall calculate the total revenue lost by all
26 taxing authorities in the county and extend upon all property in subclass 3 of class 1 within
27 the county, a tax at the rate necessary to produce that amount. The rate of tax levied in each
28 county according to this subsection shall not be increased above the rate first imposed and
29 will stand levied at that rate unless later reduced according to the provisions of subsection 3.
30 The county collector shall disburse the proceeds according to the revenue lost by each taxing
31 authority because of the exemption of such property in that county. Restitution of the
32 revenues lost by any taxing district contained in more than one county shall be from the
33 several counties according to the revenue lost because of the exemption of property in each
34 county. Each year after the first year the replacement tax is imposed, the amount distributed
35 to each taxing authority in a county shall be increased or decreased by an amount equal to the
36 amount resulting from the change in that district's total assessed value of property in subclass
37 3 of class 1 at the countywide replacement tax rate. In order to implement the provisions of
38 this subsection, the limits set in section 11(b) of this article may be exceeded, without voter
39 approval, if necessary to allow each county listed in section 11(b) to comply with this
40 subsection.
41 3. Any increase in the tax rate imposed pursuant to subsection 2 of this section shall
42 be decreased if such decrease is approved by a majority of the voters of the county voting on
43 such decrease or by the elected governing body of the county as provided by the rules
44 and procedures of such county. The provisions of section 22 of this article shall apply to
45 the tax levy imposed under subsection 2 of this section. A decrease in the increased tax
HJR 126 3
46 rate imposed under subsection 2 of this section may be submitted to the voters of a county by
47 the governing body thereof upon its own order, ordinance, or resolution and shall be
48 submitted upon the petition of at least eight percent of the qualified voters who voted in the
49 immediately preceding gubernatorial election.
50 4. As used in this section, the terms "revenues lost" and "lost revenues" shall mean
51 that revenue which each taxing authority received from the imposition of a tangible personal
52 property tax on all personal property held as industrial inventories, including raw materials,
53 work in progress and finished work on hand, by manufacturers and refiners, and all personal
54 property held as goods, wares, merchandise, stock in trade or inventory for resale by
55 distributors, wholesalers, or retail merchants or establishments in the last full tax year
56 immediately preceding the effective date of the exemption from taxation granted for such
57 property under subsection 1 of this section, and which was no longer received after such
58 exemption became effective.
Section 17. As used in sections 16 through 24 of Article X:
2 (1) "Total state revenues" includes all general and special revenues, license and fees,
3 excluding federal funds, as defined in the budget message of the governor [for fiscal year
4 1980-1981]. Total state revenues shall exclude the amount of any credits based on actual tax
5 liabilities or the imputed tax components of rental payments, but shall include the amount of
6 any credits not related to actual tax liabilities.

4 general assembly shall not impose taxes of any kind which, together with all other revenues
5 of the state, federal funds excluded, exceed the revenue limit established in this section. The
6 revenue limit shall be calculated for each fiscal year and shall be equal to the product of the
7 ratio of total state revenues in the previous fiscal year [1980-1981] divided by the personal
8 income of Missouri in the calendar year [1979] prior to the previous fiscal year multiplied
9 by the personal income of Missouri in either the calendar year prior to the calendar year in
10 which appropriations for the fiscal year for which the calculation is being made, or the
11 average of personal income of Missouri in the previous three calendar years, whichever is
12 greater.
HJR 126 4
13 (b) For any fiscal year in the event that total state revenues exceed the revenue limit
14 established in this section by one percent or more, the excess revenues shall be refunded pro
15 rata based on the liability reported on the Missouri state income tax (or its successor tax or
16 taxes) annual returns filed following the close of such fiscal year. If the excess is less than
17 one percent, this excess shall be transferred to the general revenue fund.
18 (c) The revenue limitation established in this section shall not apply to taxes imposed
19 for the payment of principal and interest on bonds, approved by the voters and authorized
20 under the provisions of this constitution.
21 (d) If responsibility for funding a program or programs is transferred from one level
22 of government to another, as a consequence of constitutional amendment, the state revenue
23 and spending limits may be adjusted to accommodate such change, provided that the total
24 revenue authorized for collection by both state and local governments does not exceed that
25 amount which would have been authorized without such change.

11 subsection.

13 produced by the total of all tax or fee increases enacted by the general assembly in a fiscal
14 year,lessapplicablerefundsandlessallcontemporaneouslyoccurringtaxorfeereductionsin

29 [aggregate actual new annual] increase in total state revenues produced by each individual
30 tax or fee change in the first fiscal year [that each individual tax or fee change is fully
31 effective] following enactment. If a tax or fee change is to be implemented over multiple
32 years, the increase in total state revenues from the first fiscal year following enactment
33 shall be used to extrapolate the total increase in revenues once fully implemented, and
34 this result shall be used for the compliance measurement for the year the general
35 assembly approved the tax or fee increase.
