22 eligibility of a surviving spouse for a property tax credit if a person of the age of sixty-five
23 years or older who would have otherwise met the requirements for a property tax credit dies

37 have not dealt at arm's length, and that the gross rent is excessive, then he shall determine the
38 gross rent based upon a reasonable amount of rent. Gross rent shall be deemed to be paid
39 only if actually paid prior to the date a return is filed. The director of revenue may prescribe

80 For purposes of this subdivision, property taxes are "levied" when the tax roll is delivered to
81 the director of revenue for collection. If a claimant owns a homestead part of the preceding
82 calendar year and rents it or a different homestead for part of the same year, "property taxes
83 accrued" means only taxes levied on the homestead both owned and occupied by the
84 claimant, multiplied by the percentage of twelve months that such property was owned and
85 occupied as the homestead of the claimant during the year. When a claimant owns and
86 occupies two or more different homesteads in the same calendar year, property taxes accrued
87 shall be the sum of taxes allocable to those several properties occupied by the claimant as a
88 homestead for the year. If a homestead is an integral part of a larger unit such as a farm, or

6 total, up to one thousand fifty-five dollars in rent constituting property taxes actually
