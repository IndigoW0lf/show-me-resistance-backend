17 evidence exists which was not considered before entry of judgment and either:
18 (1) An allegation that genetic testing was conducted within ninety days prior to the
19 filing of such petition using DNA methodology to determine the probability or improbability
20 of paternity, and performed by an expert as defined in section 210.834. The affidavit shall

28 submit to genetic paternity testing. The genetic paternity testing costs shall be paid by the
29 petitioner.
30 4. Upon a finding that the genetic test referred to herein was properly conducted,
31 accurate, and indicates that the person subject to the child support payment order has been
32 excluded as the child's father, the court shall, unless it makes written findings of fact and
33 conclusions of law that it is in the best interest of the parties not to do so:
34 (1) Grantreliefonthepetitionandenterjudgmentsettingasidethepreviousjudgment
35 orjudgments ofpaternity andsupport, or acknowledgmentofpaternityunder section 210.823

42 5. The provisions of this section shall not apply to grant relief to the parent of any
43 adopted child.
44 6. A finding under subsection 4 of this section shall constitute a material mistake of
45 fact under section 210.823.
46 7. The provisions of this section shall not be construed to create a cause of action to
47 recover child support or state debt, under subdivision (2) of subsection 1 of section 454.465
48 and subsection [10] 9 of section 452.340, that was previously paid pursuant to the order. The
49 petitioner shall have no right for reimbursement for any moneys previously paid pursuant to
50 said order.
51 8. Any petitioner who has pled guilty to or been found guilty of an offense for
52 criminalnonsupport under section 568.040, as to a child orchildren who have been found not
HB 2148 3
53 to be the biological child or children of the petitioner, may apply to the court in which the
54 petitioner pled guilty or was sentenced for an order to expunge from all official records all
55 recordations of his arrest, plea, trial, or conviction. If the court determines, after hearing, that
56 the petitioner has had a judgment or judgments of paternity and support set aside under this
57 section, the court shall enter an order of expungement. Upon granting of the order of
58 expungement under this subsection, the records and files maintained in any administrative or
59 court proceeding in an associate or circuit division of the circuit court under this section shall
60 beconfidentialandonlyavailabletothepartiesorbyorderofthecourtforgoodcauseshown.
61 The effect of such order shall be to restore such person to the status he or she occupied prior
62 to such arrest, plea, or conviction and as if such event had never taken place. No person as to
63 whom such order has been entered shall be held thereafter under any provision of any law to
64 be guilty of perjury or otherwise giving a false statement by reason of his failure to recite or
65 acknowledge such arrest, plea, trial, conviction, or expungement in response to any inquiry
66 made of him for any purpose whatsoever and no such inquiry shall be made for information
67 relating to an expungement under this section.
68 9. Beginning in 2010, the family support division shall track and report to the general
69 assembly the number of cases known to the division in which a court, within the calendar
70 year, set aside a previous judgment or judgments of paternity and support under subsection 4
71 of this section. The family support division shall submit the report annually by December
72 thirty-first.
452.340. 1. In a proceeding for dissolution of marriage, legal separation or child
2 support, the court may order either or both parents owing a duty of support to a child of the
3 marriage to pay an amount reasonable or necessary for the support of the child, including an
4 award retroactive to the date of filing the petition, without regard to marital misconduct, after
5 considering all relevant factors including:
6 (1) The financial needs and resources of the child;
7 (2) The financial resources and needs of the parents;
8 (3) The standard of living the child would have enjoyed had the marriage not been
9 dissolved;
10 (4) The physical and emotional condition of the child, and the child's educational
11 needs;
12 (5) Thechild'sphysicalandlegalcustodyarrangements,includingtheamountoftime
13 the child spends with each parent and the reasonable expenses associated with the custody or
14 visitation arrangements; and
15 (6) The reasonable work-related child care expenses of each parent.
16 2. The obligation of the parent ordered to make support payments shall abate, in
17 whole or in part, for such periods of time in excess of thirty consecutive days that the other
HB 2148 4
18 parent has voluntarily relinquished physical custody of a child to the parent ordered to pay
19 child support, notwithstanding any periods of visitation or temporary physical and legal or
20 physical or legal custody pursuant to a judgment of dissolution or legal separation or any
21 modification thereof. In a IV-D case, the family support division may determine the amount
22 of the abatement pursuant to this subsection for any child support order and shall record the
23 amount of abatement in the automated child support system record established pursuant to
24 chapter 454. If the case is not a IV-D case and upon court order, the circuit clerk shall record
25 the amount of abatement in the automated child support system record established in chapter
26 454.
27 3. Unless the circumstances of the child manifestly dictate otherwise and the court
28 specifically so provides, the obligation of a parent to make child support payments shall
29 terminate when the child:
30 (1) Dies;
31 (2) Marries;
32 (3) Enters active duty in the military;
33 (4) Becomes self-supporting, provided that the custodial parent has relinquished the
34 child from parental control by express or implied consent; or
35 (5) Reaches age eighteen or receives a high school diploma or an equivalent
36 certificate of graduation in lieu of a high school diploma, unless the provisions of the
37 child support order specifically extend the parental support order past the child's
38 eighteenth birthday for reasons provided by subsection 4 [or 5] of this section [apply; or
39 (6) Reaches age twenty-one, unless the provisions of the child support order
40 specifically extend the parental support order past the child's twenty-first birthday for reasons
41 provided by subsection 4 of this section].
42 4. If the child is physically or mentally incapacitated from supporting himself and
43 insolvent and unmarried, the court may extend the parental support obligation past the child's
44 eighteenth birthday.
45 5. [If when a child reaches age eighteen, the child is enrolled in and attending a
46 secondary school program of instruction, the parental support obligation shall continue, if the
47 child continues to attend and progresses toward completion of said program, until the child
48 completes such program or reaches age twenty-one, whichever first occurs. If the child is
49 enrolled in an institution of vocational or higher education not later than October first
50 following graduation from a secondary school or completion of a graduation equivalence
51 degree program and so long as the child enrolls for and completes at least twelve hours of
52 credit each semester, not including the summer semester, at an institution of vocational or
53 higher education and achieves grades sufficient to reenroll at such institution, the parental
54 support obligation shall continue until the child completes his or her education, or until the
HB 2148 5
55 child reaches the age of twenty-one, whichever first occurs. To remain eligible for such
56 continued parental support, at the beginning of each semester the child shall submit to each
57 parent a transcript or similar official document provided by the institution of vocational or
58 higher education which includes the courses the child is enrolled in and has completed for
59 each term, the grades and credits received for each such course, and an official document
60 from the institution listing the courses which the child is enrolled in for the upcoming term
61 andthenumberofcreditsforeachsuchcourse. Whenenrolledinatleasttwelvecredithours,
62 if the child receives failing grades in half or more of his or her courseload in any one
63 semester, payment of child support may be terminated and shall not be eligible for
64 reinstatement. Upon request for notification of the child's grades by the noncustodial parent,
65 thechildshallproducetherequireddocumentstothenoncustodialparentwithinthirtydaysof
66 receipt of grades from the education institution. If the child fails to produce the required
67 documents, payment of child support may terminate without the accrual of any child support
68 arrearage and shall not be eligible for reinstatement. If the circumstances of the child
69 manifestly dictate, the court may waive the October first deadline for enrollment required by
70 this subsection. If the child is enrolled in such an institution, the child or parent obligated to
71 pay support may petition the court to amend the order to direct the obligated parent to make
72 the payments directly to the child. As used in this section, an "institution of vocational
73 education" means any postsecondary training or schooling for which the student is assessed a
74 fee and attends classes regularly. "Higher education" means any community college, college,
75 or university at which the child attends classes regularly. A child who has been diagnosed
76 witha developmentaldisability, asdefined in section 630.005, orwhose physical disability or
77 diagnosed health problem limits the child's ability to carry the number of credit hours
78 prescribed in this subsection, shall remain eligible for child support so long as such child is
79 enrolled in and attending an institution of vocational or higher education, and the child
80 continues to meet the other requirements of this subsection. A child who is employed at least
81 fifteen hours per week during the semester may take as few as nine credit hours per semester
82 and remain eligible for child support so long as all other requirements of this subsection are
83 complied with.
84 6.] The court shall consider ordering a parent to waive the right to claim the tax
85 dependency exemption for a child enrolled in an institution of vocational or higher education
86 in favor of the other parent if the application of state and federal tax laws and eligibility for
87 financial aid will make an award of the exemption to the other parent appropriate.
88 [7.] 6. The general assembly finds and declares that it is the public policy of this state
89 that frequent, continuing and meaningful contact with both parents after the parents have
90 separated or dissolved their marriage is in the best interest of the child except for cases where
91 the court specifically finds that such contact is not in the best interest of the child. In order to
HB 2148 6
92 effectuate this public policy, a court with jurisdiction shall enforce visitation, custody and
93 child support orders in the same manner. A court with jurisdiction may abate, in whole or in
94 part, any past or future obligation of support and may transfer the physical and legal or
95 physical or legal custody of one or more children if it finds that a parent has, without good
96 cause, failed to provide visitation or physical and legal or physical or legal custody to the
97 other parent pursuant to the terms of a judgment of dissolution, legal separation or
98 modifications thereof. The court shall also award, if requested and for good cause shown,
99 reasonable expenses, attorney's fees and court costs incurred by the prevailing party.
100 [8.] 7. The Missouri supreme court shall have in effect a rule establishing guidelines
101 by which any award of child support shall be made in any judicial or administrative
102 proceeding. Said guidelines shall contain specific, descriptive and numeric criteria which
103 will result in a computation of the support obligation. The guidelines shall address how the
104 amountofchildsupport shallbecalculatedwhenanawardofjointphysicalcustodyresultsin
105 the child or children spending equal or substantially equal time with both parents and the
106 directions and comments and any tabular representations of the directions and comments for
107 completion of the child support guidelines and a subsequent form developed to reflect the
108 guidelinesshallreflecttheabilitytoobtainuptoafiftypercentadjustmentorcreditbelowthe
109 basic child support amount for joint physical custody or visitation as described in subsection
110 [11]10ofthissection. TheMissourisupremecourtshallpublishchildsupportguidelinesand

112 the child support guidelines. Any rule made pursuant to this subsection shall be reviewed by

114 in the determination of appropriate child support award amounts.
115 [9.] 8. There shall be a rebuttable presumption, in any judicial or administrative
116 proceeding for the award of child support, that the amount of the award which would result
117 from the application of the guidelines established pursuant to subsection [8] 7 of this section
118 is the correct amount of child support to be awarded. Awritten finding or specific finding on
119 the record in a judicial or administrative proceeding that the application of the guidelines
120 would be unjust or inappropriate in a particular case, after considering all relevant factors,
121 including the factors set out in subsection 1 of this section, shall be required and shall be
122 sufficient to rebut the presumption in the case. The written finding or specific finding on the
123 record shall detail the specific relevant factors that required a deviation from the application
124 of the guidelines.
125 [10.] 9. Pursuant to this or any other chapter, when a court determines the amount
126 owed by a parent for support provided to a child by another person, other than a parent, prior

129 section 454.465, the court or director shall use the guidelines established pursuant to
130 subsection[8]7ofthissection. Theamountofchildsupportresultingfromtheapplicationof
131 the guidelines shall be applied retroactively for a period prior to the establishment of a
132 support order and the length of the period of retroactivity shall be left to the discretion of the
133 court or director. There shall be a rebuttable presumption that the amount resulting from
134 application of the guidelines under subsection [8] 7 of this section constitutes the amount
135 owed by the parent for the period prior to the date of the filing of the petition for support or
136 the period for which state debt is being established. In applying the guidelines to determine a
137 retroactive support amount, when information as to average monthly income is available, the

141 particular case upon finding, after consideration of all relevant factors, including the factors
142 set out in subsection 1 of this section, that there is sufficient cause to rebut the presumed
143 amount.

152 [12.] 11. The obligation of a parent to make child support payments may be
153 terminated as follows:
154 (1) Providedthatthestatecaseregistryorchildsupportordercontainsthechild'sdate
155 of birth, the obligation shall be deemed terminated without further judicial or administrative
156 process when the child reaches age [twenty-one] eighteen if the child support order does not
157 specifically require payment of child support beyond age [twenty-one] eighteen for reasons
158 provided by subsection 4 of this section;
159 (2) The obligation shall be deemed terminated without further judicial or
160 administrative process when the parent receiving child support furnishes a sworn statement
161 or affidavit notifying the obligor parent of the child's emancipation in accordance with the
162 requirements of subsection 4 of section 452.370, and a copy of such sworn statement or
163 affidavit is filed with the court which entered the order establishing the child support
164 obligation, or the family support division for an order entered under section 454.470;
HB 2148 8
165 (3) The obligation shall be deemed terminated without further judicial or
166 administrative process when the parent paying child support files a sworn statement or
167 affidavit with the court which entered the order establishing the child support obligation, or

174 which entered the order establishing the child support obligation, or the family support
175 division for an order entered under section 454.470, when the parent paying child support
176 files a sworn statement or affidavit with the court which entered the order establishing the
177 child support obligation, or the family support division, as applicable, stating that the child is
178 emancipated and reciting the factual basis for such statement; and which statement or
179 affidavit is served by the court or division, as applicable, on the child support obligee. If the
180 obligee denies the statement or affidavit, the court or division shall thereupon treat the sworn
181 statement or affidavit as a request for hearing and shall proceed to hear and adjudicate such
182 request for hearing as provided by law; provided that the court may require the payment of a
183 deposit as security for court costs and any accrued court costs, as provided by law, in relation
184 to such request for hearing. When the division receives a request for hearing, the hearing
185 shall be held in the manner provided by section 454.475.
186 [13.] 12. The court may enter a judgment terminating child support pursuant to
187 subdivisions (1) to (3) of subsection [12] 11 of this section without necessity of a court

191 affidavits to terminate orders of child support obligations for use pursuant to subsection [12]
192 11 of this section and subsection 4 of section 452.370.
454.470. 1. The director may issue a notice and finding of financial responsibility to
2 a parent who owes a state debt or who is responsible for the support of a child on whose
3 behalf the custodian of that child is receiving support enforcement services from the division
