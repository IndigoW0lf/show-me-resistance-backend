Be it enacted by the General Assembly of the State of Missouri, as follows:
1 Section A. Chapter 427, RSMo, is amended by adding thereto
2 one new section, to be known as section 427.300, to read as

37 transaction in which the business forwards or otherwise
38 sells to the provider all or a portion of the business's
39 accounts or payment intangibles at a discount to their
40 expected value. The provider's characterization of an

46 expectation of compensation, obtains a commercial financing

60 where the proceeds are provided to a business or are
61 intended to be used to carry on a business and not for
62 personal, family, or household purposes. For purposes of
63 determining whether a transaction is a business purpose
64 transaction, the provider may rely on any written statement
65 of intended purpose signed by the business. The statement
66 may be a separate statement or may be contained in an
67 application, agreement, or other document signed by the
68 business or the business owner or owners;
69 (6) "Commercial financing facility", a provider's plan

76 open-end credit plan or each to the extent the transaction
77 is a business purpose transaction;
78 (8) "Commercial loan", a loan to a business, whether

96 association, federal savings bank, or federal credit union
97 that is authorized to transact business in this state; and
98 (c) A savings and loan association, savings bank, or

100 state that is authorized to transact business in this state;
101 (11) "General intangible", any personal property,
102 including things in action, other than accounts, chattel
103 paper, commercial tort claims, deposit accounts, documents,

115 a depository institution to arrange for the extension of a
116 commercial financing transaction by the depository
117 institution to a business via an online lending platform
118 administered by the person. The fact that a provider
119 extends a specific offer for a commercial financing
120 transaction on behalf of a depository institution shall not
121 be construed to mean that the provider engaged in lending or
122 financing or originated that loan or financing.
123 3. (1) A provider that consummates a commercial
124 financing transaction shall disclose the terms of the
125 commercial financing transaction as required by this
126 section. The disclosures shall be provided at or before
127 consummation of the transaction. Only one disclosure is
128 required for each commercial financing transaction, and a
129 disclosure is not required as a result of the modification,
130 forbearance, or change to a consummated commercial financing
131 transaction.
132 (2) A provider shall disclose the following in
133 connection with each commercial financing transaction:
134 (a) The total amount of funds provided to the business
135 under the terms of the commercial financing transaction.
136 This disclosure shall be labeled "Total Amount of Funds
137 Provided";
138 (b) The total amount of funds disbursed to the
139 business under the terms of the commercial financing
140 transaction, if less than the total amount of funds
141 provided, as a result of any fees deducted or withheld at
142 disbursement and any amount paid to a third party on behalf
143 of the business. This disclosure shall be labeled "Total
144 Amount of Funds Disbursed";
SB 753 6
145 (c) The total amount to be paid to the provider
146 pursuant to the commercial financing transaction agreement.

148 (d) The total dollar cost of the commercial financing
149 transaction under the terms of the agreement, derived by
150 subtracting the total amount of funds provided from the
151 total of payments. This calculation shall include any fees
152 or charges deducted by the provider from the "Total Amount
153 of Funds Provided". This disclosure shall be labeled "Total
154 Dollar Cost of Financing";
155 (e) The manner, frequency, and amount of each
156 payment. This disclosure shall be labeled "Payments". If
157 the payments may vary, the provider shall instead disclose
158 the manner, frequency, and the estimated amount of the
159 initial payment labeled "Estimated Payments" and the
160 commercial financing transaction agreement shall include a
161 description of the methodology for calculating any variable
162 payment and the circumstances when payments may vary; and
163 (f) A statement of whether there are any costs or
164 discounts associated with prepayment of the commercial
165 financing transaction including a reference to the paragraph
166 in the agreement that creates the contractual rights of the
167 parties related to prepayment. This disclosure shall be
168 labeled "Prepayment".
169 (3) A provider that consummates a commercial financing
170 facility may provide disclosures required by subdivision (2)
171 of this subsection that are based on an example of a
172 transaction that could occur under the agreement. The
173 example shall be based on an account receivable total face
174 amount owed of ten thousand dollars. Only one disclosure is
175 required for each commercial financing facility, and a
176 disclosure is not required as result of a modification,
SB 753 7
177 forbearance, or change to the facility. A new disclosure is
178 not required each time accounts receivable are purchased
179 under the facility.
