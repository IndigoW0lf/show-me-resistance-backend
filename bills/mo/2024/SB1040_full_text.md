21 a party, may appoint a guardian ad litem to appear for and
22 represent an abused or neglected child involved in
23 proceedings arising under subsection 6 of section 210.152.
24 [3.] 4. The guardian ad litem shall be provided with
25 all reports relevant to the case made to or by any agency or
26 person, shall have access to all records of such agencies or
27 persons relating to the child or such child's family members
28 or placements of the child, and upon appointment by the

53 public funds. However, no fees as a judgment shall be taxed
54 against a party or parties who have not been found to have
55 abused or neglected a child or children. Such an award of
56 guardian fees shall constitute a final judgment in favor of
57 the guardian ad litem. Such final judgment shall be
58 enforceable against the parties in accordance with chapter
59 513.
60 [6.] 7. The court may designate volunteer advocates,
61 who may or may not be attorneys licensed to practice law, to

66 persons designated as volunteer advocates, including
67 utilization of the family care safety registry and access
68 line pursuant to sections 210.900 to 210.937, to ensure the
69 safety and welfare of the children such persons are
70 designated to represent. The volunteer advocate shall be
71 provided with all reports relevant to the case made to or by
72 any agency or person, shall have access to all records of
73 such agencies or persons relating to the child or such
74 child's family members or placements of the child, and upon
75 designation by the court to a case, shall be informed of and
76 have the right to attend any and all family support team
77 meetings involving the child. Any such designated person
78 shall receive no compensation from public funds. This shall
79 not preclude reimbursement for reasonable expenses.

85 prolonged foster care may have on a child. A nonattorney
86 volunteer advocate shall have access to a court appointed
87 attorney guardian ad litem should the circumstances of the
88 particular case so require.
