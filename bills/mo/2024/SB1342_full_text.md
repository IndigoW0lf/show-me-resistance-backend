INTRODUCED BY SENATOR ARTHUR.
5006S.01I KRISTINA MARTIN, Secretary
AN ACT
To repeal sections 451.040, 451.080, and 451.090, RSMo, and to enact in lieu thereof three new
sections relating to the age of marriage, with existing penalty provisions.
Be it enacted by the General Assembly of the State of Missouri, as follows:
1 Section A. Sections 451.040, 451.080, and 451.090, RSMo,
2 are repealed and three new sections enacted in lieu thereof, to
3 be known as sections 451.040, 451.080, and 451.090, to read as
4 follows:
1 451.040. 1. Previous to any marriage in this state, a
2 license for that purpose shall be obtained from the officer
3 authorized to issue the same, and no marriage contracted
4 shall be recognized as valid unless the license has been
5 previously obtained, and unless the marriage is solemnized
6 by a person authorized by law to solemnize marriages.
7 2. Before applicants for a marriage license shall
8 receive a license, and before the recorder of deeds shall be
9 authorized to issue a license, the parties to the marriage
10 shall present an application for the license, duly executed
11 and signed in the presence of the recorder of deeds or their
12 deputy or electronically through an online process. If an
13 applicant is unable to sign the application in the presence
14 of the recorder of deeds as a result of the applicant's
15 incarceration or because the applicant has been called or
16 ordered to active military duty out of the state or country,
17 the recorder of deeds may issue a license if:
EXPLANATION-Matter enclosed in bold-faced brackets [thus] in this bill is not enacted
and is intended to be omitted in the law.
SB 1342 2
18 (1) An affidavit or sworn statement is submitted by
19 the incarcerated or military applicant on a form furnished
20 by the recorder of deeds which includes the necessary
21 information for the recorder of deeds to issue a marriage
22 license under this section. The form shall include, but not
23 be limited to, the following:
24 (a) The names of both applicants for the marriage
25 license;
26 (b) The date of birth of the incarcerated or military
27 applicant;
28 (c) An attestation by the incarcerated or military
29 applicant that both applicants are not related;
30 (d) The date the marriage ended if the incarcerated or
31 military applicant was previously married;
32 (e) An attestation signed by the incarcerated or
33 military applicant stating in substantial part that the
34 applicant is unable to appear in the presence of the
35 recorder of deeds as a result of the applicant's
36 incarceration or because the applicant has been called or
37 ordered to active military duty out of the state or country,
38 which will be verified by the professional or official who
39 directs the operation of the jail or prison or the military
40 applicant's military officer, or such professional's or
41 official's designee, and acknowledged by a notary public
42 commissioned by the state of Missouri at the time of
43 verification. However, in the case of an applicant who is
44 called or ordered to active military duty outside Missouri,
45 acknowledgment may be obtained by a notary public who is
46 duly commissioned by a state other than Missouri or by
47 notarial services of a military officer in accordance with
48 the Uniform Code of Military Justice at the time of
49 verification;
SB 1342 3
50 (2) The completed marriage license application of the
51 incarcerated or military applicant is submitted which
52 includes the applicant's Social Security number; except
53 that, in the event the applicant does not have a Social
54 Security number, a sworn statement by the applicant to that
55 effect; and
56 (3) A copy of a government-issued identification for
57 the incarcerated or military applicant which contains the
58 applicant's photograph. However, in such case the
59 incarcerated applicant does not have such an identification
60 because the jail or prison to which he or she is confined
61 does not issue an identification with a photo his or her
62 notarized application shall satisfy this requirement.
63 3. Each application for a license shall contain the
64 Social Security number of the applicant, provided that the
65 applicant in fact has a Social Security number, or the
66 applicant shall sign a statement provided by the recorder
67 that the applicant does not have a Social Security number.
68 The Social Security number contained in an application for a
69 marriage license shall be exempt from examination and
70 copying pursuant to section 610.024. After the receipt of
71 the application the recorder of deeds shall issue the
72 license, unless one of the parties withdraws the
73 application. The license shall be void after thirty days
74 from the date of issuance.
75 4. Any person violating the provisions of this section
76 shall be deemed guilty of a misdemeanor.
77 5. Common-law marriages shall be null and void.
78 6. Provided, however, that no marriage shall be deemed
79 or adjudged invalid, nor shall the validity be in any way
80 affected for want of authority in any person so solemnizing
81 the marriage pursuant to section 451.100, if consummated
SB 1342 4
82 with the full belief on the part of the persons, so married,
83 or either of them, that they were lawfully joined in
84 marriage.
85 7. In the event a recorder of deeds utilizes an online
86 process to accept applications for a marriage license or to
87 issue a marriage license and the applicants' identity has
88 not been verified in person, the recorder of deeds shall
89 have a two-step identity verification process or a process
90 that independently verifies the identity of such
91 applicants. Such process shall be adopted as part of any
92 electronic system for marriage licenses if the applicants do
93 not present themselves to the recorder of deeds or his or
94 her designee in person. It shall be the responsibility of
95 the recorder of deeds to ensure any process adopted to allow
96 electronic application or issuance of a marriage license
97 verifies the identities of both applicants. The recorder of
98 deeds shall not accept applications for or issue marriage
99 licenses through the process provided in this subsection
100 unless [both applicants are at least eighteen years of age
101 and] at least one of the applicants is a resident of the
102 county or city not within a county in which the application
103 was submitted.
1 451.080. 1. The recorders of the several counties of
2 this state, and the recorder of the city of St. Louis,
