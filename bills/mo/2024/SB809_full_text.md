97 shall apply only to independent rural health clinics,
98 provider-based rural health clinics where the provider is a
99 critical access hospital as provided in 42 U.S.C. Section

109 other reason of any applicable geographic proximity shall be
110 available if a physician is collaborating with an advanced
111 practice registered nurse in excess of any geographic
112 proximity limit. The board of nursing and the state board
113 of registration for the healing arts shall review each
SB 809 5
114 application for a waiver of geographic proximity and approve
115 the application if the boards determine that adequate
116 supervision exists between the collaborating physician and
117 the advanced practice registered nurse. The boards shall
118 have forty-five calendar days to review the completed
119 application for the waiver of geographic proximity. If no
120 action is taken by the boards within forty-five days after
121 the submission of the application for a waiver, then the
122 application shall be deemed approved. If the application is
123 denied by the boards, the provisions of section 536.063 for
124 contested cases shall apply and govern proceedings for
125 appellate purposes; and

144 (9) A description of the time and manner of the
145 collaborating physician's review of the advanced practice
SB 809 6
146 registered nurse's delivery of health care services. The
147 description shall include provisions that the advanced
148 practice registered nurse shall submit a minimum of ten
149 percent of the charts documenting the advanced practice
150 registered nurse's delivery of health care services to the
151 collaborating physician for review by the collaborating
152 physician, or any other physician designated in the
153 collaborative practice arrangement, every fourteen days;
154 (10) The collaborating physician, or any other
155 physician designated in the collaborative practice
156 arrangement, shall review every fourteen days a minimum of
157 twenty percent of the charts in which the advanced practice
158 registered nurse prescribes controlled substances. The
159 charts reviewed under this subdivision may be counted in the
160 number of charts required to be reviewed under subdivision
161 (9) of this subsection; and
162 (11) If a collaborative practice arrangement is used
163 in clinical situations where a collaborating advanced
164 practice registered nurse provides health care services that
165 include the diagnosis and initiation of treatment for
166 acutely or chronically ill or injured persons, then the
167 collaborating physician or any other physician designated in
168 the collaborative practice arrangement shall be present for
169 sufficient periods of time, at least once every two weeks,
170 except in extraordinary circumstances that shall be
171 documented, to participate in a chart review and to provide
172 necessary medical direction, medical services,
173 consultations, and supervision of the health care staff.
174 4. The state board of registration for the healing
175 arts pursuant to section 334.125 and the board of nursing
176 pursuant to section 335.036 may jointly promulgate rules
177 regulating the use of collaborative practice arrangements.
SB 809 7
178 Such rules shall be limited to the methods of treatment that
179 may be covered by collaborative practice arrangements and
180 the requirements for review of services provided pursuant to
181 collaborative practice arrangements including delegating
182 authority to prescribe controlled substances. Any rules
183 relating to geographic proximity shall allow a collaborating
184 physician and a collaborating advanced practice registered
185 nurse to practice within two hundred miles by road of one
186 another until August 28, 2025, if the nurse is providing
187 services in a correctional center, as defined in section
188 217.010. Any rules relating to dispensing or distribution
189 of medications or devices by prescription or prescription
190 drug orders under this section shall be subject to the
191 approval of the state board of pharmacy. Any rules relating
192 to dispensing or distribution of controlled substances by
193 prescription or prescription drug orders under this section
194 shall be subject to the approval of the department of health
195 and senior services and the state board of pharmacy. In
196 order to take effect, such rules shall be approved by a
197 majority vote of a quorum of each board. Neither the state
198 board of registration for the healing arts nor the board of
199 nursing may separately promulgate rules relating to
200 collaborative practice arrangements. Such jointly
201 promulgated rules shall be consistent with guidelines for
202 federally funded clinics. The rulemaking authority granted
203 in this subsection shall not extend to collaborative
204 practice arrangements of hospital employees providing
205 inpatient care within hospitals as defined pursuant to
206 chapter 197 or population-based public health services as
207 defined by 20 CSR 2150- 5.100 as of April 30, 2008.

209 arts shall not deny, revoke, suspend or otherwise take
SB 809 8
210 disciplinary action against a physician for health care
211 services delegated to a registered professional nurse
212 provided the provisions of this section and the rules
213 promulgated thereunder are satisfied. Upon the written
214 request of a physician subject to a disciplinary action
215 imposed as a result of an agreement between a physician and
216 a registered professional nurse or registered physician
217 assistant, whether written or not, prior to August 28, 1993,
218 all records of such disciplinary licensure action and all
219 records pertaining to the filing, investigation or review of
220 an alleged violation of this chapter incurred as a result of
221 such an agreement shall be removed from the records of the
222 state board of registration for the healing arts and the
223 division of professional registration and shall not be
224 disclosed to any public or private entity seeking such
225 information from the board or the division. The state board
226 of registration for the healing arts shall take action to
227 correct reports of alleged violations and disciplinary
228 actions as described in this section which have been
229 submitted to the National Practitioner Data Bank. In
230 subsequent applications or representations relating to his
231 or her medical practice, a physician completing forms or
232 documents shall not be required to report any actions of the
233 state board of registration for the healing arts for which
234 the records are subject to removal under this section.
235 6. Within thirty days of any change and on each
236 renewal, the state board of registration for the healing
237 arts shall require every physician to identify whether the
238 physician is engaged in any collaborative practice
239 arrangement, including collaborative practice arrangements
240 delegating the authority to prescribe controlled substances,
241 or physician assistant collaborative practice arrangement
SB 809 9
242 and also report to the board the name of each licensed
243 professional with whom the physician has entered into such
244 arrangement. The board shall make this information
245 available to the public. The board shall track the reported
246 information and may routinely conduct random reviews of such
247 arrangements to ensure that arrangements are carried out for
248 compliance under this chapter.
249 7. Notwithstanding any law to the contrary, a
250 certified registered nurse anesthetist as defined in
251 subdivision (8) of section 335.016 shall be permitted to
252 provide anesthesia services without a collaborative practice
253 arrangement provided that he or she is under the supervision
254 of an anesthesiologist or other physician, dentist, or
255 podiatrist who is immediately available if needed. Nothing
256 in this subsection shall be construed to prohibit or prevent
257 a certified registered nurse anesthetist as defined in
258 subdivision (8) of section 335.016 from entering into a
259 collaborative practice arrangement under this section,
260 except that the collaborative practice arrangement may not
261 delegate the authority to prescribe any controlled
262 substances listed in Schedules III, IV, and V of section
263 195.017, or Schedule II - hydrocodone.
264 8. A collaborating physician shall not enter into a
265 collaborative practice arrangement with more than six full-
266 time equivalent advanced practice registered nurses, full-
267 time equivalent licensed physician assistants, or full-time
268 equivalent assistant physicians, or any combination
269 thereof. This limitation shall not apply to collaborative
270 arrangements of hospital employees providing inpatient care
271 service in hospitals as defined in chapter 197 or population-
272 based public health services as defined by 20 CSR 2150-
273 5.100 as of April 30, 2008, or to a certified registered
SB 809 10
274 nurse anesthetist providing anesthesia services under the
275 supervision of an anesthesiologist or other physician,
276 dentist, or podiatrist who is immediately available if
277 needed as set out in subsection 7 of this section.
278 9. It is the responsibility of the collaborating
279 physician to determine and document the completion of at
280 least a one-month period of time during which the advanced
281 practice registered nurse shall practice with the
282 collaborating physician continuously present before
283 practicing in a setting where the collaborating physician is
284 not continuously present. This limitation shall not apply
285 to collaborative arrangements of providers of population-
286 based public health services, as defined by 20 CSR 2150-
287 5.100 as of April 30, 2008, or to collaborative practice
288 arrangements between a primary care physician and a primary
289 care advanced practice registered nurse or a behavioral
290 health physician and a behavioral health advanced practice
291 registered nurse, where the collaborating physician is new
292 to a patient population to which the advanced practice
293 registered nurse is familiar.
294 10. No agreement made under this section shall
295 supersede current hospital licensing regulations governing
296 hospital medication orders under protocols or standing
297 orders for the purpose of delivering inpatient or emergency
298 care within a hospital as defined in section 197.020 if such
299 protocols or standing orders have been approved by the
300 hospital's medical staff and pharmaceutical therapeutics
301 committee.
302 11. No contract or other term of employment shall
303 require a physician to act as a collaborating physician for
304 an advanced practice registered nurse against the
305 physician's will. A physician shall have the right to
SB 809 11
306 refuse to act as a collaborating physician, without penalty,
307 for a particular advanced practice registered nurse. No
308 contract or other agreement shall limit the collaborating
309 physician's ultimate authority over any protocols or
310 standing orders or in the delegation of the physician's
311 authority to any advanced practice registered nurse, but
312 this requirement shall not authorize a physician in
313 implementing such protocols, standing orders, or delegation
314 to violate applicable standards for safe medical practice
315 established by hospital's medical staff.
316 12. No contract or other term of employment shall
317 require any advanced practice registered nurse to serve as a
318 collaborating advanced practice registered nurse for any
319 collaborating physician against the advanced practice
320 registered nurse's will. An advanced practice registered
321 nurse shall have the right to refuse to collaborate, without
322 penalty, with a particular physician.
323 13. (1) The provisions of this section shall not
324 apply to an advanced practice registered nurse who has been
325 in a collaborative practice arrangement for a cumulative two
326 thousand documented hours with a collaborating physician and
327 whose license is in good standing. Any such advanced
328 practice registered nurse shall not be required to enter
329 into or remain in an arrangement in order to practice in
330 this state. Any other provisions of law requiring a
331 collaborative practice arrangement or delegation shall not
332 be required for an advanced practice registered nurse
333 described in this subsection.
334 (2) The provisions of this subsection shall not apply
335 to certified registered nurse anesthetists.
336 (3) Notwithstanding any provision of this section to
337 the contrary, an advanced practice registered nurse applying
SB 809 12
338 for licensure by endorsement may demonstrate to the state
339 board of nursing completion of a cumulative two thousand
340 documented hours of practice. Such advanced practice
341 registered nurses shall not be required to enter into a
