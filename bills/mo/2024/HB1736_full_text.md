16 (6) Any employee of a religious institution whose religious obligations or constraints
17 prohibit their serving on a jury. The certification of the employment and obligation or
18 constraint may be provided by the employee's religious supervisor;
19 (7) Any person who is [seventy-five] seventy years of age or older.
20 2. A judge of the court for which the individual was called to jury service shall make
21 undue or extreme physical or financial hardship determinations. The authority to make these
22 determinations is delegable only to court officials or personnel who are authorized by the
23 laws of this state to function as members of the judiciary.
24 3. A person asking to be excused based on a finding of undue or extreme physical or
25 financial hardship must take all actions necessary to have obtained a ruling on that request by
26 no later than the date on which the individual is scheduled to appear for jury duty.
27 4. Unless it is apparent to the court that the physical hardship would significantly
28 impair the person's ability to serve as a juror, for purposes of sections 494.400 to 494.460
29 undue or extreme physical or financial hardship is limited to circumstances in which an
30 individual would:
31 (1) Be required to abandon a person under his or her personal care or supervision due
32 to the impossibility of obtaining an appropriate substitute caregiver during the period of
33 participation in the jury pool or on the jury; or
34 (2) Incur costs that would have a substantial adverse impact on the payment of the
35 individual's necessary daily living expenses or on those for whom he or she provides the
36 principal means of support; or
37 (3) Suffer physical hardship that would result in illness or disease.
38 5. Undue or extreme physical or financial hardship does not exist solely based on the
39 factthataprospectivejurorwillberequiredtobeabsentfromhisorherplaceofemployment.
40 6. A person asking a judge to grant an excuse based on undue or extreme physical or
41 financial hardship shall provide the judge with documentation as required by the judge, such
42 as, but not limited to, federal and state income tax returns, medical statements from licensed
43 physicians, proof of dependency or guardianship, and similar documents, which the judge
44 finds to clearly support the request to be excused. Failure to provide satisfactory
45 documentation shall result in a denial of the request to be excused. Such documents shall be
46 filed under seal.
47 7. After two years, a person excused from jury service shall become eligible once
48 again for qualification as a juror unless the person was excused from service permanently. A
49 person is excused from jury service permanently only when the deciding judge determines
50 that the underlying grounds for being excused are of a permanent nature.
