25 shall not be deemed a violation of sections 407.1025 to
26 407.1049 for a motorcycle or all-terrain vehicle franchisor
27 to require a motorcycle or all-terrain vehicle franchisee to
28 have an inventory of parts, tools and equipment reasonably
29 necessary to service the motorcycles or all-terrain vehicles
30 sold by a motorcycle or all-terrain vehicle franchisor; or

40 provided, however, the failure to deliver any motorcycle or
41 all-terrain vehicle shall not be considered a violation of
42 sections 407.1025 to 407.1049 if such failure is due to an
43 act of God, work stoppage, or delay due to a strike or labor
44 difficulty, shortage of products or materials, freight
45 delays, embargo or other cause of which such motorcycle or
46 all-terrain vehicle franchisor has no control;
SB 1358 6
47 (4) To coerce any motorcycle or all-terrain vehicle
48 franchisee to enter into any agreement with such motorcycle
49 or all-terrain vehicle franchisor or to do any other act
50 prejudicial to such motorcycle or all-terrain vehicle
51 franchisee, by threatening to cancel any franchise or any
52 contractual agreement existing between such motorcycle or
53 all-terrain vehicle franchisor and motorcycle or all-terrain
54 vehicle franchisee; provided, however, that notice in good
55 faith to any motorcycle or all-terrain vehicle franchisee of
56 such motorcycle or all-terrain vehicle franchisee's
57 violation of any provisions of such franchise or contractual
58 agreement shall not constitute a violation of sections
59 407.1025 to 407.1049;
60 (5) To terminate, cancel or refuse to continue any
61 franchise, directly or indirectly through the actions of the
62 franchisor, unless such new motorcycle or all-terrain
63 vehicle franchisee substantially defaults in the performance
64 of such franchisee's reasonable and lawful obligations under
65 such franchisee's franchise, or such new motorcycle or all-
66 terrain vehicle franchisor discontinues the sale in the
67 state of Missouri of such franchisor's products which are
68 the subject of the franchise:
69 (a) Notwithstanding the terms of any franchise
70 agreement to the contrary, good cause to terminate, cancel
71 or refuse to continue any franchise agreement shall not be
72 established based upon the fact that the motorcycle or all-
73 terrain vehicle franchisee owns, has an investment in,
74 participates in the management of or holds a franchise
75 agreement for the sale or service of another make or line of
76 new motorcycles or all-terrain vehicles or the motorcycle or
77 all-terrain vehicle dealer has established another make or
78 line of new motorcycles or all-terrain vehicles or service
SB 1358 7
79 in the same dealership facilities as those of the motorcycle
80 or all-terrain vehicle franchisor prior to February 1, 1998,
81 or such establishment is approved in writing by the
82 franchisee and the franchisor. However, a franchisor may
83 require a franchisee to maintain a reasonable line of credit
84 for each franchise and to comply with each franchisor's
85 reasonable requirements concerning capital, management and
86 facilities. If the franchise agreement requires the
87 approval of the franchisor, such approval shall be requested
88 in writing by the franchisee and the franchisor shall
89 approve or disapprove such a request in writing within sixty
90 days of receipt of such request. A request from a
91 franchisee shall be deemed to have been approved if the
92 franchisor fails to notify the franchisee, in writing, of
93 its disapproval within sixty days after its receipt of the
94 written request;
95 (b) In determining whether good cause exists, the
96 administrative hearing commission shall take into
97 consideration the existing circumstances, including, but not
98 limited to, the following factors:

100 market;
101 b. The franchisee's investment and obligations;
102 c. Injury to the public welfare;
103 d. The adequacy of the franchisee's service
104 facilities, equipment, parts and personnel in relation to
105 those of other franchisees of the same line-make;
106 e. Whether warranties are being honored by the
107 franchisee;
108 f. The parties' compliance with their franchise
109 agreement;
SB 1358 8
110 g. The desire of a franchisor for market penetration
111 or a market study, if any, prepared by the franchisor or
112 franchisee are two factors which may be considered;
113 h. The harm to the franchisor;
114 (6) To prevent by contract or otherwise, any
115 motorcycle or all-terrain vehicle franchisee from changing
116 the capital structure of the franchisee's franchise of such
117 motorcycle or all-terrain vehicle franchisee or the means by
118 or through which the franchisee finances the operation of
119 the franchisee's franchise, provided the motorcycle or all-
120 terrain vehicle franchisee at all times meets any reasonable
121 capital standards agreed to between the motorcycle or all-
122 terrain vehicle franchisee and the motorcycle or all-terrain
123 vehicle franchisor and grants to the motorcycle or all-
124 terrain vehicle franchisor a purchase money security
125 interest in the new motorcycles or all-terrain vehicles, new
126 parts and accessories purchased from the motorcycle or all-
127 terrain vehicle franchisor;
128 (7) (a) Prevent, by contract or otherwise, any sale
129 or transfer of a franchisee's franchise or franchises or
130 interest or management thereof; provided, if the franchise
131 specifically permits the franchisor to approve or disapprove
132 any such proposed sale or transfer, a franchisor shall only
133 be allowed to disapprove a proposed sale or transfer if the
134 interest being sold or transferred when added to any other
135 interest owned by the transferee constitutes fifty percent
136 or more of the ownership interest in the franchise and if
137 the proposed transferee fails to satisfy any standards of
138 the franchisor which are in fact normally relied upon by the
139 franchisor prior to its entering into a franchise, and which
140 relate to the proposed management or ownership of the
141 franchise operations or to the qualification,
SB 1358 9
142 capitalization, integrity or character of the proposed
143 transferee and which are reasonable. A franchisee may
144 request, at any time, that the franchisor provide a copy of
145 the standards which are normally relied upon by the
146 franchisor to evaluate a proposed sale or transfer and a
147 proposed transferee;
148 (b) The franchisee and the prospective franchisee
149 shall cooperate fully with the franchisor in providing
150 information relating to the prospective transferee's
151 qualifications, capitalization, integrity and character;
152 (c) In the event of a proposed sale or transfer of a
153 franchise, the franchisor shall be permitted to exercise a
154 right of first refusal to acquire the franchisee's assets or
155 ownership if:
156 a. The franchise agreement permits the franchisor to
157 exercise a right of first refusal to acquire the
158 franchisee's assets or ownership in the event of a proposed
159 sale or transfer;
160 b. Such sale or transfer is conditioned upon the
161 franchisor or franchisee entering a franchise agreement with
162 the proposed transferee;
163 c. The exercise of the right of first refusal shall
164 result in the franchisee and the franchisee's owners
165 receiving the same or greater consideration and the same
166 terms and conditions as contracted to receive in connection
167 with the proposed sale or transfer;
168 d. The sale or transfer does not involve the sale or
169 transfer to an immediate member or members of the family of
170 one or more franchisee owners, defined as a spouse, child,
171 grandchild, spouse of a child or grandchild, brother, sister
172 or parent of the franchisee owner, or to the qualified
173 manager, defined as an individual who has been employed by
SB 1358 10
174 the franchisee for at least two years and who otherwise
175 qualifies as a franchisee operator, or a partnership or
176 corporation controlled by such persons; and
177 e. The franchisor agrees to pay the reasonable
178 expenses, including attorney's fees which do not exceed the
179 usual, customary and reasonable fees charged for similar
180 work done for other clients, incurred by the proposed
181 transferee prior to the franchisor's exercise of its right
182 of first refusal in negotiating and implementing the
183 contract for the proposed sale or transfer of the franchise
184 or the franchisee's assets. Notwithstanding the foregoing,
185 no payment of such expenses and attorney's fees shall be
186 required if the franchisee has not submitted or caused to be
187 submitted an accounting of those expenses within fourteen
188 days of the franchisee's receipt of the franchisor's written
189 request for such an accounting. Such accounting may be
190 requested by a franchisor before exercising its right of
191 first refusal;
192 (d) For determining whether good cause exists for the
193 purposes of this subdivision, the administrative hearing
194 commission shall take into consideration the existing
195 circumstances, including, but not limited to, the following
196 factors:
197 a. Whether the franchise agreement specifically
198 permits the franchisor to approve or disapprove any proposed
199 sale or transfer;

201 added to any other interest owned by the proposed transferee
202 constitutes fifty percent or more of the ownership interest
203 in the franchise;
204 c. Whether the proposed transferee fails to satisfy
205 any standards of the franchisor which are in fact normally
SB 1358 11
206 relied upon by the franchisor prior to its entering into a
207 franchise, and which are related to the proposed management
208 or ownership of the franchise operations or to the
209 qualification, capitalization, integrity or character of the
210 proposed transferee which are reasonable;
211 d. Injury to the public welfare;
212 e. The harm to the franchisor;
213 (8) To prevent by contract or otherwise any motorcycle
214 or all-terrain vehicle franchisee from changing the

217 motorcycle or all-terrain vehicle franchisor to demonstrate
218 by giving reasons that such change in executive management
219 will be detrimental to the distribution of the motorcycle or
220 all-terrain vehicle franchisor's motorcycles shall not
221 constitute a violation of this subdivision;

223 upon a motorcycle or all-terrain vehicle franchisee;
224 (10) To require a motorcycle or all-terrain vehicle
225 franchisee at the time of entering into a franchise

236 (13) Upon any termination, cancellation or refusal to
237 continue any franchise or any discontinuation of any line-
