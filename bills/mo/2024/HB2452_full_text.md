66 reasons therefor. In addition to any other requirements required by law or rule, prior to
67 granting the application, the director of the division of credit unions shall determine that:
68 (1) The credit union has the immediate ability to serve the additional group or
69 common geographic area. In making this determination, the director shall consider the data
70 required to be reported on an annual basis by the state-chartered credit unions that includes
71 aggregated information about the census tracts in which members reside, the actual or
72 estimated annual income of members, and types and numbers of loans or extensions of credit
73 for which members received approval. For the purposes of this section, the term "member
74 data" shall mean information on the income levels of credit union members that credit unions
75 are required to report; provided, however, that no member data includes the names, account
76 numbers, or taxpayer identification numbers. In the event that the National Credit Union
77 Administration (NCUA) has a regulation on member data reporting requirements, the state

89 commission finds that the decision or the findings of the director of the division of credit
90 unions was arbitrary and capricious or not based on evidence in the director's possession, the
91 commission shall set aside the findings and decision of the director of the division of credit
92 unions and enter its own findings and decision. Any party in the proceeding before the
93 commission who has exhausted all administrative remedies provided by law may appeal the
94 decision to the circuit court of Cole County.
