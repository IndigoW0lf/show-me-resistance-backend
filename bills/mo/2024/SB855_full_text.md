131 (1) For a customer-generator, a retail electric
132 supplier shall measure the net electrical energy produced or
133 consumed during the billing period in accordance with normal
134 metering practices for customers in the same rate class,
135 either by employing a single, bidirectional meter that
136 measures the amount of electrical energy produced and
137 consumed, or by employing multiple meters that separately
138 measure the customer-generator's consumption and production
139 of electricity;
140 (2) If the electricity supplied by the supplier
141 exceeds the electricity generated by the customer-generator
142 during a billing period, the customer-generator shall be
143 billed for the net electricity supplied by the retail
144 electric supplier in accordance with normal practices for
145 customers in the same rate class;
SB 855 6
146 (3) If the electricity generated by the customer-
147 generator exceeds the electricity supplied by the supplier
148 during a billing period, the customer-generator shall be
149 billed for the appropriate customer and demand charges for
150 that billing period in accordance with subsection 3 of this
151 section and shall be credited an amount at least equal to
152 the avoided fuel cost of the excess kilowatt-hours generated
153 during the billing period, with this credit applied to the
154 following billing period;
155 (4) Any credits granted by this subsection shall
156 expire without any compensation at the earlier of either
157 twelve months after their issuance or when the customer-
158 generator disconnects service or terminates the net metering
159 relationship with the supplier;
