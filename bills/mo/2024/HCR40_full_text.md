RESOLUTION NO. 40
102ND GENERAL ASSEMBLY
INTRODUCED BY REPRESENTATIVE BARINGER.

WHEREAS, a century ago, in October 1924, Ireland formally opened diplomatic
2 relations with the United States of America when Timothy Smiddy presented his credentials
3 to President Calvin Coolidge. Following the Irish people’s long and painful struggle for
4 independence, the U.S. was one of the first nations to recognize the fledgling Irish state
5 earlier that year, and when Smiddy emerged from the White House, he had become Ireland’s
6 first Ambassador to any country in the world. It was very appropriate that Ireland’s first
7 representativeoverseas should be dispatched to Washington, D.C. for, while 1924 marked the
8 beginning of formal diplomatic relations, the deep Irish-American connection dated back
9 centuries; and
10
11 WHEREAS, today, nearly one-tenth of Americans identify as being of Irish ancestry.
12 Irish immigrants helped build the America we know today, not only the physical
13 infrastructure from the skyscrapers of Manhattan to the transcontinental railroad, but also
14 the political construct that is America; and
15
16 WHEREAS, Irish people have made an enormous contribution to public debate and
17 politics in America, from their local communities right up to the White House. More than
18 twenty American Presidents claimed some Irish ancestry. But the influence of Irish America
19 extendswellbeyondtheOvalOfficeandtheCapitolbuilding,toeverystatewithintheUnion,
20 most evident in the significant number of state legislators within the American Irish State
21 Legislators Caucus; and
22
23 WHEREAS, since Timothy Smiddy’s momentous audience in the Oval Office 100
24 yearsago,afurthereighteenIrishAmbassadorshavepresentedcredentialstoU.S.Presidents.
25 Over this time, Ireland’s relations with the United States have evolved significantly. From an
26 impoverished and internationally isolated state, scarred by years of conflict, Ireland has
HCR 40 2
27 transformed over the past century. Ireland today is at peace, economically prosperous, and
28 culturally vibrant; and
29
30 WHEREAS, this transformation is due to the support of friends in the United States,
31 from the crucial role America played in brokering peace in Northern Ireland, culminating
32 with the 1998 Good Friday Agreement, to the huge American economic investment in
33 Ireland. There are almost one thousand U.S. companies in Ireland, employing over two
34 hundred thousand people directly. Our economic relationship is truly two-way; some one
35 hundred thousand people are employed in the U.S. by over 650 Irish-owned companies,
36 across all fifty states. Indeed, Ireland is now the ninth largest source of foreign direct
37 investment in the U.S.; and
38
39 WHEREAS, the U.S.-Irish relationship is a shining example of how ancestral ties,
40 historical connections, cultural affinities, and shared values can create a foundation for
41 enduringpartnershipandmutualprosperity. IrishAmericanstatelegislatorsacrosstheUnited
42 States are playing a vitally important role in fostering this partnership and ensuring that it
43 continues and flourishes for another century to come:
44
45 NOW THEREFORE BE IT RESOLVED that the members of the House of
46 Representatives of the One Hundred Second General Assembly, Second Regular Session, the
47 Senate concurring therein, hereby recognize and celebrate the special relationship between
48 the United States and Ireland; and
49
50 BE IT FURTHER RESOLVED that the Chief Clerk of the Missouri House of
51 Representatives be instructed to prepare a properly inscribed copy of this resolution for the
52 American Irish State Legislators Caucus.
