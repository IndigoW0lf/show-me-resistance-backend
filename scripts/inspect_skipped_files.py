inspect_skipped_files.py

DESCRIPTION:
This script is used to quickly inspect the first few lines of any Markdown bill text files
that were skipped during a batch operation‚Äîtypically during GPT summary backfills or bill number extraction.
The goal is to diagnose formatting inconsistencies or file corruption that caused the file to be ignored.

FUNCTIONALITY:
- Defines a list of filenames that were previously skipped.
- Attempts to open and read the first 5 lines of each file from the Markdown bill text directory.
- Prints a readable preview of each skipped file to standard output.
- Reports any read or encoding failures.

USE CASES:
- Troubleshooting skipped files (e.g., missing bill numbers, formatting issues)
- Manually identifying anomalies in bill files for targeted reprocessing

INPUTS:
- `MARKDOWN_FOLDER`: Path to the bill text files (e.g., `./bills/MO/2024`)
- `SKIPPED_FILES`: Hardcoded list of filenames you want to inspect

OUTPUT:
- Previews printed directly to the terminal

REQUIREMENTS:
- Python 3.x

PIPELINE CONTEXT:
- üß™ This is a standalone debugging tool, used after processing or summarization scripts
- üîÅ Pairs well with: `backfill_full_text.py`, `extract_bill_number()` failures, or GPT skips
